<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName><date when="1843-06-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> June 1843</date></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Watt</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Your long and excellent letter I found awaiting my return from
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> a few days ago. I wrote you twice previous to leaving
<lb/>the <date when="1843-02-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of <choice><abbr>Feby</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice></date> &amp; now I shall give you some account
<lb/>of my sayings &amp; doings since that period. I passed northward
<lb/>in nearly the same path I trode last year but I had now
<lb/>different objects in view. I have told you of the massacre
<lb/><add place="above">of the people</add> of the unfortunate but brave <persName>Sebegoe</persName>. No one would go
<lb/>with me to him for several months as every one feared
<lb/>for his life. And they had some cause to fear for <w>sever<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>al</w> of the people of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> were there at the period
<lb/>of attack on a trading visit &amp; the night previous
<lb/>to the attack by <persName>Mahura</persName> they had accidentally fired a
<lb/>gun &amp; as usual engaged in family worship. The
<lb/>former deed is considered by the people of <choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan><persName>Sebegoe</persName></expan></choice> as the <w>sign<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>al</w> by which they apprised <persName>Mahura</persName> where they were
<lb/>&amp; the latter as incantations to ensure success in
<lb/>their undertaking. I longed to go to him &amp; disabuse
<lb/>his mind of the unfavourable impression against the
<lb/>gospel it had received but it was the above date
<lb/>before I could prevail on <choice><sic>any one</sic><corr>anyone</corr></choice> to drive my
<lb/>waggon. Well I went straight to the town
<lb/>where he with the remains of his tribe have taken
<lb/>taken up their abode &amp; entering squatted down beside
<lb/>him as if I had been an old acquaintance. He
<lb/>&amp; his people recognized a young man who was 
<lb/>with me as having been of the trading party
<lb/>&amp; after the prove identification had passed <!-- Is "prove" correct here, or should it be "proof"? HB 6-16-13 -->
<lb/><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan><persName>Sebegoe</persName></expan></choice> turned to me and said Why have you attacked &amp;
<lb/>destroyed all my people. I gave him a <term type="nationality">Scotch</term>
<lb/>answer &amp; said Why did you refuse to listen
<lb/>to the <choice><sic>advise</sic><corr>advice</corr></choice> I have your messengers last year
<lb/>not to leave the <placeName><region>Bakalihari</region></placeName> desert as <persName>Mahura</persName>
<lb/>would certainly attack you if you did. Did your
<lb/>messengers not deliver my message or did you
<lb/>discredit it &amp; thus destroy yourself? I was</p>
	<cb/>
<lb/><p>If you could procure the seeds of the "asclepia gigantica" or any other
<lb/>medicinal plants &amp; seal them carefully up in a bottle or tin you would
<lb/>oblige me much. Of Cardamons, all must be sealed from sea air</p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000525_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>He was evidently surprised to get such an answer as he
<lb/>imagined he had acted quite properly in all he had done. He said
<lb/>he did not disbelieve my message but had been compelled by the 
<lb/>sickness &amp; <unclear cert="high">deaths</unclear> of his people, want of water &amp; corn to
<lb/>come out of the desert &amp; was on his way when he sent
<lb/>messengers with the <choice><abbr>ox</abbr><expan>oxen</expan></choice> to me. The messengers who have
<lb/>escaped the slaughter recognized me again &amp; our subsequent
<lb/>intercourse was of a most friendly description. By the
<lb/>bye <persName>Sebegoe</persName> lives about 10 days from this &amp; near the
<lb/>place where <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName> faced about to go home. The
<lb/>oven foundries, he mentions as not having been permitted
<lb/>to see I gave you an account of the reason he was
<lb/>not permitted to see them as no one who has had <!-- seems to be added writing above "as no" HB 6-16-13 -->
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">female</del> intercourse with the other sex since the period
<lb/>of the year when they commence to work the iron
<lb/>is permitted to approach as they believe firmly the
<lb/>presence of such a one would certainly bewitch alias
<lb/>burn the metal. This which of course always occurs
<lb/>when they blow too hard is invariably attributed to
<lb/>witchcraft. I who am a <choice><sic>batchelor</sic><corr>bachelor</corr></choice> am permitted
<lb/>to examine freely. And this spot is that <unclear cert="low">ambush</unclear><!-- return to as not correct word, ks -->
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> saw the notorious <persName>Moselekatze</persName>, I walked
<lb/>over the site of his town &amp; the place where he
<lb/>suffered his last sad defeat by the <choice><orig><sic>boors</sic></orig><corr>Boors</corr><reg>Boers</reg></choice> &amp; a few
<lb/>human bones are the only remains I could
<lb/>observe of the former greatness of the tyrant
<lb/>I am thus circumstantial because I shall probably be
<lb/>for some time located in that very neighbourhood
<lb/>I passed on to the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> but the commotions
<lb/>lately convulsed the country have produced great
<lb/>changes in all I saw. <persName>Bubi</persName> has fled to another
<lb/>part of the country, <persName>Sechele</persName> was fulminating
<lb/>against me when I had passed him last year but
<lb/><gap agent="fading" extent="4" unit="chars"/> he did not know what to do with me for
<lb/>kindness. He told many he would lay hold on me
<lb/>if I came back to this country again But to think
<lb/>of laying hold of me when I am absent &amp; to look
<lb/>me in the face &amp; do it are two very different things</p>
	<cb/>
<lb/><p>Please refrain from apologies it fills up so much valuable
<lb/>space &amp; they are not worth the ink you write them with</p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000525_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>I had a set of most dastardly fellows with me who refused to 
<lb/>go with me beyond the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>. Woe betide them for they
<lb/>alone prevented me seeing the lake and now <persName>Moffat</persName> is on his
<lb/>way hither &amp; is going to do wonders in the way of going
<lb/>northward. I left the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> at <persName>Bubi</persName>'s &amp; proceeded on my
<lb/>pack <choice><abbr>ox</abbr><expan>oxen</expan></choice> more than 200 miles north of that, a distance
<lb/>greater than I should have been obliged to go had I
<lb/>according to my plan got the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> on to the <term type="tribe"><w>Bamang<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-wato</w></term> &amp; thence proceeded to the lake. As it is if <persName>Moffat</persName>
<lb/>goes beyond every other white man I can tell you
<lb/>he will go a good way, for I have been as far beyond
<lb/>his furthest point north as he has been beyond <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>A weary way it was &amp; that too beneath a burning sun
<lb/>But I can bear thirst better than the natives &amp; am as
<lb/>tough as a "wuddy"<!-- this word is Scots for a hangman's noose usually made from willow, ks, 14.11.12 --> I had the privilege of making known
<lb/>the glad tidings of mercy to many who never before
<lb/>heard them or saw the face of a European. I had
<lb/>three wild <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> as my only attendants &amp; poor
<lb/>fellows they served me faithfully. Every night
<lb/>gave me the best place at the fire &amp; the first 
<lb/>dive at the meat. We were entirely <choice><sic>dependant</sic><corr>dependent</corr></choice> on
<lb/>my gun for food and many a weary <unclear cert="low">man</unclear> with an empty
<lb/>stomach <unclear cert="medium">I had</unclear> after the game. I killed 2 rhinoceros
<lb/>8 large antelopes, we ate or rather took a "blow out"
<lb/>over the carcass, each one then took a piece &amp;
<lb/>away we trudged. You go with a tent. My tents
<lb/>were growing <choice><sic>every where</sic><corr>everywhere</corr></choice>. A bush at my head &amp;
<lb/>a fire at my feet with some grass spread under
<lb/>were my necessary abodes for 3 weeks &amp; 10 days
<lb/>The lions were very numerous &amp; sometimes came
<lb/>so close, roaring tremendously, we were or rather I
<lb/>was obliged to get up &amp; fire at them. I became
<lb/>acquainted with many of that poor oppressed 
<lb/>tribe called <term type="tribe">Bakalahari</term> who are usually used by
<lb/>all the other <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>. They usually have fled
<lb/>from us but now I got into friendship with
<lb/>many as they came when they saw me in the
<lb/>wilderness &amp; invited me to their villages which
<lb/>are usually so situated it is very difficult to 

	

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000525_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>find them out. They are obliged to hunt almost constant<supplied cert="high">ly</supplied>
<lb/>for their masters &amp; are not allowed to keep anything to
<lb/>themselves of what they take Once they supplied my want
<lb/>when I should have been put to shifts without their aid I
<lb/>had the misfortune to break my finger bone when descending
<lb/>the lofty rocks of the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> &amp; was unable to procure
<lb/>food for my party with the gun. They had had the
<lb/>fortune to kill a horse a little before &amp; generously gave
<lb/>me a supply which lasted till we arrived at the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>
<lb/>Meat was my staple article of diet but I eat <w>every<supplied cert="high">-</supplied><lb break="no"/>thing</w> eaten by the natives. Bread is quite out of 
<lb/>the question. locusts a kind of large caterpillar &amp;c &amp;c
<lb/>every thing goes down with them &amp; so they had to
<lb/>do with me. I lost my way one day &amp; became
<lb/>entirely separated from my companions. I wandered
<lb/>on &amp; on &amp; on the country was a flat forest, I slept
<lb/>on a tree while the lions &amp; <choice><sic>hyeanas</sic><corr>hyenas</corr></choice> howled around
<lb/>my airy couch. The following night late I arrived at
<lb/>a village of <term type="tribe">Bakalahari</term> &amp; right thankful I was to see
<lb/>the human face divine or rather dirty for hungry
<lb/>&amp; faint &amp; weary I had often thrown myself down under
<lb/>a bush &amp; thought that here I should surely die. But <choice><sic>the 
<lb/>the</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> Lord was merciful to me &amp; <add place="inline">˄</add><add place="above">next day</add> I got food &amp; two
<lb/>men to go in search of my <unclear cert="high">surviving</unclear> companions.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Professor Owen</persName> has got one box but I am waiting
<lb/>for further instructions before I shall send the other, a
<lb/>third box I gave in charge to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Williams</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="village">Hankey</settlement></placeName> an
<lb/>excellent man who is now compelled to leave for <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>in consequence of a disease in the throat. He was
<lb/>fully bent on accompanying me to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> But
<lb/>was prevented by the opinions of medical men
<lb/>in the colony. As soon as he gets well he intends to <!-- Should "colony" be tagged in some way? HB 6-16-13 -->
<lb/>come out &amp; strike fair across the country to
<lb/>where I am. He is no <persName>Shirley Shalliet</persName> but a right <w>good<supplied cert="high">-</supplied><lb break="no"/>hearted</w><term type="nationality">Welshman</term>. I hope he will succeed in one
<lb/>object he has in view by the Establishment of a
<lb/><term type="nationality">Welsh</term> missionary magazine &amp; if so I shall give in
<lb/>the <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> D. G Watt </persName><placeName><settlement type="city">Benares</settlement></placeName> as a contributor to its pages

<lb/>Tell me if you object. He has been most successful among
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Hottentots</term> of <placeName><settlement type="village">Hankey</settlement></placeName> &amp; I pray be may be still more <w>success<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>ful</w> amongst the inhabitants of the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>
<lb/>What do you think. I am appointed member of the
<lb/>district committee about to be established here and
<lb/>this without asking me whether I liked the affair or
<lb/>not. A strange world we live in this <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>. But we
<lb/>shall see. I mean to vote against its coming into the
<lb/>world at all &amp; after that give myself not trouble
<lb/>at all about it, for to meet only once a year
<lb/>would in this slow travelling country cost me at
<lb/>least <choice><orig>⅟₁₂</orig><reg>1/12</reg></choice> of my time. How is your committee
<lb/>organized? <persName>Inglis</persName> &amp; <persName>Ashton</persName> are on their way
<lb/>to this place &amp; are designed by the directors to
<lb/>go to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>, they are both intent on obeying
<lb/>the command to increase &amp; multiply &amp; replenish the
<lb/>earth. Last night I was called up to assist but
<lb/>in another way the same laudable undertaking, the night
<lb/>before to another &amp; in a day or two I expect to be
<lb/>at a third so you see we are all tending one way
<lb/>Please present my very kind regards to <persName>Budden</persName>
<lb/>&amp; <persName>Kennedy</persName>. If they become ill they must not
<lb/>run away to <placeName><country>England</country></placeName><add place="inline">˄</add><add place="above">at once</add>. It will do them good to
<lb/>take a look at this outlandish quarter before
<lb/>they go. Poor <persName>Giles</persName> is gone also <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wright</persName>
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="village">Phillipolis</settlement></placeName>. May we be enabled to improve
