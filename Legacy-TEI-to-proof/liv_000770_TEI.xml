<lb/><p><persName>Rev<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> W. Thompson</persName>
<lb/>My Dear Sir
<lb/>Enclosed you will <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> a letter which
<lb/>I have ventured to address to the Lieutenant Governor
<lb/>I have endeavoured to give a plain outline of the
<lb/>facts and merely hinted at the possible consequences
<lb/>and view of the Government goes on heedlessly
<lb/><choice><abbr>tho</abbr><expan>though</expan></choice> blame will rest on its own shoulders. I enclose
<lb/>it to you because I understand you are expected
<lb/>to be our go between in all matters pertaining to the 
<lb/>Government. The reason which I feel the chief one
<lb/>in my mind for troubling you is that you may
<lb/>reverse your judgement on it whether it ought to be
<lb/>delivered at all － From it and <persName>Mr Moffat</persName>'s letter
<lb/>you will have a pretty clear idea of the doings of
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Robertson</persName>'s converts &#x97; and may fancy that reverend
<lb/>sinner turning up the white of his eyes and saying to 
<lb/>them at the communion table "Eat O friends! drink, yea
<lb/>drink abundantly O beloved"－they went the whole hog
<lb/>attended church on Sunday hearing <persName><unclear cert="medium">Mebahe</unclear></persName> preach and  
<lb/>then made the parson flee for his life on Monday
<lb/>he ran the gauntlet some of them calling out when
<lb/>they saw him with clothes on there is the chief &amp;
<lb/>then the bullets whistled over behind &amp; before him
<lb/>he seems to have become terrified－ran through 
<lb/>the midst of the <choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice> &amp; so fast his feet were
<lb/>dreadfully bruised － He has lost all he had － <unclear cert="low">my</unclear><!-- Cannot make out last word, and no option seems to fit both the writing and the context..closest guess would be "nearly" for context, but doesn't match text, so very confused HB 10/30/12 -->
<lb/>27 head of cattle &amp; furniture &amp;c his house was
<lb/>burned by the <hi rend="underline">Christians</hi>. He it was who stood by
<lb/>me when bitten by the lion &amp; got bit himself － He
<lb/>has been with me ever since I came into the country</p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000770_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>but I fear this will be a settler for him － he is now on
<lb/>his way out here. Some fine young men whom I
<lb/>knew and loved have fallen － My heart is sore when
<lb/>I think of them － <persName>Sechele</persName> had two bullets through his hat
<lb/>and a third through his coat sleeve － the Boers have
<lb/>lost one of their principal men － I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know his
<lb/>name － The chief with whom <persName>Inglis</persName> lives is heart &amp;
<lb/>soul with the Boers. He ought to leave. He has informed
<lb/><persName>Solomon</persName> that he is going to the <placeName><settlement>Cape</settlement></placeName> in order to send
<lb/>his wife and children to <placeName><country>England</country></placeName><add place="above">not of course in imitation of me</add> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Edwards</persName> sends
<lb/>her children to <placeName><settlement type="town">Walthamstow</settlement></placeName> school. If you ask
<lb/>the opinion of the Directors you will find that they
<lb/>would like <persName>Inglis</persName> to come home too and there would 
<lb/>be little doubt but that he would remain there
<lb/>You may wonder what will be the end of all this
<lb/>and you may perhaps wonder still more if I venture to
<lb/>say that I see nothing in it all unfavourable to the
<lb/>progress of the kingdom of <persName>Christ</persName> － There is evidently
<lb/>a process in operation in the whole of <placeName><country>South Africa</country></placeName>－
<lb/>and there soon will appear another wonderful <w>develop
<lb break="no"/>-ment</w> of this Providence who is wonderful in counsel
<lb/>&amp; excellent in working. In every district of the country
<lb/>the process tends the same way － We "poor renegades from
<lb/>the anvil and loom" long insisted that the <term type="tribe">Hottentots</term> had
<lb/>souls and our statements were looked upon as the blarney
<lb/>of silly enthusiasm, A few hundred of them however
<lb/>take it into their monkey heads to rebel and they actually
<lb/>kick the <foreign xml:lang="und">ossa coccyges</foreign> of our dragoons and <unclear cert="low">minié</unclear>
<lb/>rifle men－ No wonder that great was the wrath
<lb/>of the <choice><abbr>Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi></abbr><expan>Government</expan></choice> Officials － <term type="tribe">Hottentot</term> rebellion! what next. We may
<lb/>expect our cats to have a strike "<choice><abbr>cause</abbr><expan>because</expan></choice> missus <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> give
<lb/>us the silver forks to eat with "－ If we had hinted at a
<lb/><term type="tribe">Hottentot</term> rebellion I believe they would have believed
<lb/>that a cow could handle a musket as well as they － The
<lb/>Rebellion is however a great fact and the <w>con-

<lb/>But I am away from my <unclear cert="medium">text</unclear> － Everywhere there is a strong
<lb/>feeling of <choice><sic>independance</sic><corr>independence</corr></choice> springing up － The <term type="nationality">English</term> as a nation
<lb/>have lost character &amp; honour － the destruction of my property
<lb/>is a fortunate thing for me. there is not a native in the country 
<lb/>but knows now for certain on whose side I am. The Boers
<lb/>in plundering my house often expressed great regret that they
<lb/>had not got a hold of me. But we should yet catch him said
<lb/>they. How good God's Providence is to me. I was detained in 
<lb/><placeName><settlement>Cape Town</settlement></placeName> till I quite fretted and then again in the way up －
<lb/>But now I can plainly see that had I got my own
<lb/>way I should have been in the very thick of the fight for
<lb/>I always intended to spend a fortnight or so with the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/>I grieve over the losses they have sustained but there is another
<lb/>point of view in which the matter may considered. the majority
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="medium">Bakwains</unclear></term> have heard the gospel repeatedly but have not
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> it. They treated me uniformly with respect but when
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> professed faith in <persName>Christ</persName> they persecuted him bitterly － the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> have not only long refused to listen even but treated <persName> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName>
<lb/>with great disrespect － Nearly £1000 has been spent on them in vain
<lb/>indeed their p<add place="above">r</add>ofessed principles were to get all out of the missionary
<lb/>they could but never <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> his message － the same may be
<lb/>said of the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="medium">Bahurutse</unclear></term> and although the two stations are broken up
<lb/>it is no cause for sorrow. The <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> I am informed
<lb/>attended both school &amp; church better after I left for the <placeName><settlement>Cape</settlement></placeName> than
<lb/>for a long time previously － average of the school 80. <persName>Sechele</persName>'s
<lb/>children are out here living with <persName>Mr<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Moffat</persName> they are well behaved
<lb/>the son resembles his father in manners. They give much less
<lb/>trouble than was expected － I think the seed sown will yet spring 
<lb/>up among the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> though I may not live to see it － I am 
<lb/>at present prevented from leaving for my own country by
<lb/>two parties of Boers who are now in the North and are
<lb/>to be cut off. If I attempted to serve them they would very
<lb/>probably rob me in return, so must stand their chance
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> sends a message to me to wait a little yet so though
<lb/>it is trying to wait when free &amp; all ready for work, I must
<lb/>submit － I have just been driven away from my writing</p>

<lb/><p>by the chief <persName>Mahura</persName> － he is here on a visit － a great rogue
<lb/>he made a remark worth noting- "<persName>Sebube</persName> and <persName>Paul</persName> and you were
<lb/>taken out of the way of being killed - If either of you had been there
<lb/>you would certainly have been in the midst of the affair &amp; been killed
<lb/>God helped you by sending you out of the way" <persName>Sebube</persName> and <persName>Paul</persName>
<lb/>are gone north. <persName>Sebube</persName> is a very brave fellow － Native teacher
<lb/>to the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="medium">Waubetre</unclear></term> － He has lost all, though <persName>Mahura</persName> is a heathen
<lb/>he has imbibed some Christian knowledge － I have been thinking
<lb/>that I might draw £12 for <persName><unclear cert="low">Mebalol</unclear></persName> － I have drawn nothing
<lb/>for some time for either him or <persName>Paul</persName>, our operations have 
<lb/>been interrupted － but as it is a matter of business I shall
<lb/>write you if I do. No word from my better half yet</p>
