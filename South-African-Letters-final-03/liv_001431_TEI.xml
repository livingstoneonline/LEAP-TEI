<lb/><p rend="right">We have just
<lb/>returned from the discovery of a magnificent
<lb/>Lake called <placeName><geogName type="lake">Shirwa</geogName></placeName> <placeName><geogName type="lake">(Sheerwah)</geogName></placeName> and
<lb/>a report of the <orgName>natives</orgName> on its banks, which
<lb/>we see no reason to doubt, says, that <placeName><geogName type="lake">Shirwa</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>is separated from a much larger Lake
<lb/>by a strip of land of only <measure>five or six
<lb/>miles</measure> in width - This larger Lake is called
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyinyesi</geogName></placeName> = the stars - and is evidently<!-- Do we need to code place names with a foreign tag? MB --><!-- No. AW -->
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyanja</geogName></placeName>, <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName>, or <placeName><geogName type="lake">Uniamesi</geogName></placeName> of the <bibl>Maps</bibl><!-- Is "of the Maps" part of the placename?

<lb/>which stretches pretty well up to the Equator.
<lb/>This opening is so important that I feel
<lb/>bound to let you know about it as
<lb/>soon as possible - in order that you
<lb/>may sympathize in the emotions which
<lb/>it calls forth in connection with the
<lb/>great object we have in view - </p>
<lb/><p>We visited the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> about the beginning<!-- "Shire" had been tagged as type="shire" throughout. I changed these to river- is this correct? MB--><!-- Yes! AW -->
<lb/>of the present year and our presence
<lb/>caused considerable alarm among the people
<lb/>who had never seen white vistors before
<lb/>We ascended in our little steamer about
<lb/>a <measure>hundred miles</measure> of Latitute - the <term type="people">Portuguese</term><!-- Should Portuguese be tagged with orgName and term? MB -->
<lb/>never went more than about <measure>25 miles</measure>
<lb/>and having been beaten back had no

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">you must bear with my prosiness at first
<lb/>My reasons will appear farther on - the river
<lb/>is deep and easily navigated for <measure>one hundred
<lb/>miles</measure> - Seeing the alarm we had created - The
<lb/>people in large bodies <choice><sic>gaurding</sic><corr>guarding</corr></choice> us on both
<lb/>banks night and day we retired in order
<lb/>to let out (though I say it) decently civil conduct
<lb/>have its effect, and in the end of <date when="1859-03">March</date>
<lb/>returned, and found the inhabitants so <w>frien<add place="over-text">dl</add>y</w>,

<lb/>proceeded Northwards on foot - Our course
<lb/>lay along the banks of the <geogName type="river">Shire</geogName> which then
<lb/>was found flowing in a mountainous region.
<lb/>and though our marches were but short we
<lb/>each day gained <measure>200 or 300 feet</measure> of elevation;
<lb/>In about <measure>10 days</measure> we were <measure>1500 feet</measure> above the
<lb/>ship and in sight of a mountain - <geogName type="mountain">Dzomba</geogName> -
<lb/>or as people near it call it <geogName type="mountain">Zomba</geogName>, over <measure>6000
<lb/>feet</measure> high - A marsh prevented our following 
<lb/>the <geogName type="river">Shire</geogName> to the Northern spur of <geogName type="mountain">Zomba</geogName> to which
<lb/>it seemed to go or rather come, and in crossing
<lb/>the Southern spur we were <measure>3400 <choice><abbr>ft</abbr><expan>feet</expan></choice></measure> high, and
<lb/>thence we got our first sight of <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Shirwa</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>in the East - <space extent="2" unit="chars"/> <measure>four days</measure> afterwards we stood on
<lb/>its shores, and thanked the Great Father of All,
<lb/>for permitting us the honour of first seeing its
<lb/>broad blue waters - A grand sight it is for it
<lb/>his among bold mountain scenery - and
<lb/>all the mountains are clothed with vegetation
<lb/>and several are inhabited even on their tops
<lb/>We went some distance up a mountain and
<lb/>could see <measure>26°</measure> of watery horizon in the <choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> <choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice>, <choice><abbr>N.E.</abbr><expan>North-Northeast</expan></choice>
<lb/>only, two mountain tops rose in the blue
<lb/>distance like little islands <measure>fifty or sixty miles</measure>
<lb/>away. the Lake is of a pear shape or were it <!-- geog: Shirwa -->
<lb/>not so unpoetical I would call it of a tadpole

	<pb facs="liv_001431_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>shape - It is from <measure>25 to 30 miles</measure> wide in the
<lb/>broad part but a narrow prologation stretches
<lb/>south of where we stood some <measure>30 miles</measure>. No outlet
<lb/>is known - its water is bitter but drinkable
<lb/>and it contains plenty of <term type="animal">fish</term> <term type="animal">alligator</term>, and
<lb/><term type="animal">hippopotami</term> - <term type="animal">Leeches</term> too as we found in
<lb/>wading through a piece of marsh to get a
<lb/>meridian observation of the Sun with the natural
<lb/>horizon - The <geogName type="river">shire</geogName> probably comes out of <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyinyesi</geogName></placeName>- 
<lb/>It cannot come out of this for <hi rend="underline">its</hi> water is sweet.
<lb/>We could obtain no information about <persName>Burton</persName>'s
<lb/>party - but returning down the <placeName><geogName type="valley">valley of the 
<lb/><geogName type="lake">Shirwa</geogName></geogName></placeName> - we as certained that there is one
<lb/>point in which only which about <measure>30 miles</measure> of
<lb/>land travel will be necessary between a
<lb/>branch of the <geogName type="river">Shire</geogName>, and the southern end
<lb/>of <placeName><geogName type="lake">Shirwa</geogName></placeName> - We have got no news from <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>since we left - If <persName>Burton</persName> has preceded us to
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyinyesi</geogName></placeName> then we have got a Lake of our own
<lb/>and a short route to his - We mean to return
<lb/>shortly and I hope then to be able to tell you more
<lb/>about it.</p>
<lb/><p>At present I have to say that this is a
<lb/>real highland region - We saw many old people
<lb/>and <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> and I slept on the ground out of
<lb/>doors 20 nights and got our clothes wet with
<lb/>dew from the tall grass (<measure>7 or 8 <choice><abbr>ft</abbr><expan>feet</expan></choice></measure>) every morning
<lb/>yet returned to the ship in good health - The
<lb/>vegetation &amp; people are much like what we
<lb/>have in <placeName><settlement type="town">Londa</settlement></placeName> in the middle of the country
<lb/>also many streams with bogs - the people
<lb/>cultivate <term type="plant">cotton</term> very extensively - we never
<lb/>saw so much anywhere and this is the
<lb/>region I have pointed out as capable of becoming
<lb/>a counter poise to <orgName><term type="nationality">American</term> <orgName>slave</orgName> labour</orgName><!-- Tag American with term? MB -->
<lb/>The farther we went the more important did this
<lb/>crop appear and every one spins &amp; weaves it.

	<pb facs="liv_001431_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>Now the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> knew nothing of this Lake<!-- Does Portugues need a term tag too? MB -->
<lb/>being so near - <choice><abbr>Lat</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice> 15 23'. <choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice> the point we reached
<lb/><choice><abbr>Long.</abbr><expan>Longitude</expan></choice> 35° 35' &amp; 36° <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice> and we tell them very little -
<lb/>we allow our own <orgName>Government</orgName> to do that
<lb/>(tell them) for when I crossed the continent the <term type="people">Portuguese</term>
<lb/><term type="occupation">minister</term> claimed the honour for two black men
<lb/>(<bibl>Blue book for <date when="1857">1857</date></bibl>) with <term type="people">Portuguese</term> names, in
<lb/>order to establish a claim to lordship over the
<lb/>whole territory - then they propose to erect a
<lb/>station at the mouth of the <geogName type="river">Shire</geogName> for the same
<lb/>purpose - and a custom house at the mouth
<lb/>of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Kongone</geogName></placeName> <placeName><geogName type="branch">branch of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName></geogName></placeName> which<!-- is there a tag for branch like source? MB -->

<lb/>will thus see that I cannot have much

<lb/><orgName><term type="people">Portuguese</term> pedlars</orgName> in mens bodies &amp; souls,
<lb/>but I trust in Providence to turn all round to the

<lb/>I shall take the liberty of writing him on our
