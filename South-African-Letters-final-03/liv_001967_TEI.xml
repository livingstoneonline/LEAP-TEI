<lb/>a boat service - I would

<lb/>her cost should be about
<lb/>£70- We had one and
<lb/>found her exceedingly useful
<lb/>With a good wind, which
<lb/>could always be secured by
<lb/>selecting the time when the
<lb/>wind blows regularly up the
<lb/>river for the voyage, she
<lb/>went as fast as our

<lb/>in the lower occupations

<lb/><p>I have just returned
<lb/>from <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Nyassa</geogName></placeName> - our

<lb/>improve the time between

<lb/>then tramped it &amp; went <choice><abbr>N.W.</abbr><expan>northwest</expan></choice>
<lb/>to come to the Latitude of
<lb/>the North end of the Lake
<lb/>without intruding on the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Mazite</term> or <term type="tribe">Zulus</term>
<lb/>who have depopulated its shires
<lb/>there - but we were hindered
<lb/>by a range of mountains
<lb/>about <measure>6000 feet</measure> high. Then
<lb/>by a Mazite whom to avoid
<lb/>we turned <choice><abbr>N.E.</abbr><expan>northeast</expan></choice> and
<lb/>walked along the western
<lb/>shore of the Lake till we
<lb/>came to two <orgName>Arabs</orgName>
<lb/>busily transporting <orgName>slaves</orgName>
<lb/>and building a dhow
<lb/>to replace one that had
<lb/>been wrecked - We now
<lb/>turned West on the great
<lb/>slave route and my enquiries led me to
<lb/>the conclusion that

		<pb facs="liv_001967_0010" n="0010"/>
<lb/>from that quarter nearly

<lb/>It is only a fathom of calico
<lb/>or one shilling they have to
<lb/>pay for a boy &amp; two for
<lb/>a girl but it is curious
<lb/>that without ivory they
<lb/>would be unprofitable
<lb/>their food costs so much.
<lb/>but they carry the ivory - 
<lb/>In going West we ascend
<lb/>what from below seems
<lb/>a range of high hills but
<lb/>is the edge of a plateau
<lb/><measure>3440 feet above the sea</measure>
<lb/>the watershed hence is to

<pb facs="liv_001967_0011" n="0011"/>
<lb/>apart from this I had
<lb/>crossed so many streams
<lb/>whose mouths from
<lb/>being hidden among
<lb/>reeds we had not
<lb/>previously observed
<lb/>I was forced to conclude
<lb/>that a large river was
<lb/>not necessary to account

<lb/>several Lakes are reported

<lb/>in modern times which

<lb/>now run away - The

<lb/>his reasons for retiring
<lb/>so I am led to conjecture
<lb/>that it may be a fear
<lb/>of death owing to the sad
