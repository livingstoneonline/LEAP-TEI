<hi rend="sup underline">, and <supplied> are kicking in an extra space in front

<orig><reg> kicks in extra space after (705-3)

<addrLine> doesn't center (705-4)

2543 - why is part of this letter rendering on right?

705 - Why isn't line number showing up on last page?

<supplied> text is kicking in unnecessary space inside the square brackers. Toggle to edited text on the following page, then look at the last word: David Livingst [ one ]  should be David Livingst[one] Note also that a rdg tooltip should be display on this word, but is not. Instead, the <rdg> take is adding a second unnecessary empty space in front of the square brackets.

<p rend="right"> and <p> seem not to be interacting appropriately as a line break after the first is not being added or it is otherwise messing up the letter header

There are also issues with <p rend="right"> at the end of a letter:

<p rend="center"> is breaking lines early.

xText between lines is displaying oddly. See the end of this page:

x<placeName><region> seems to be kicking in an extra space before and after the relevant term. See the phrase "Bechuana Country" about six lines down on this page:

x<figDes> text show as generic rendering: "illustration". See about line 33 on this page:

x<p> is not indenting

x<gap>, 

x<placeName><geogName> and, separately, 

x<space> are kicking out an extra space afterwards

x<item> should not put in an extra line break
