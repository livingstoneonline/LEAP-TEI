<lb/><p>My Dear Mother </p>
<lb/><p>I am not sure whether 
<lb/>you will be pleased or not to hear 
<lb/>a mission has been established in this 
<lb/>land of darkness and of the shadow 
<lb/>of death, because Scotch bodies are 
<lb/>so desperately bigotted. 
<lb/><persName>Janet</persName> says 
<lb/>"what good can Puseyites do" and 
<lb/>the mission is certainly of that 
<lb/>school, but without saying that 
<lb/>they are perfect or asking can any 
<lb/>good come out of Nazareth - I say 
<lb/>anything is better than heathenism<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We are in the centre of the slave market 
<lb/>and it is against this gigantic 
<lb/>evil that my own mission is 
<lb/>directed. We went up lately to <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Nyassa</placeName> and found it a large 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001699_0002"/><!--pb/@n='02'-->
<lb/>body of water with a population such 
<lb/>as I never saw before for numbers 
<lb/>and the only trade was that in slaves - 
<lb/>people were offered for sale but 
<lb/>nothing else. Fancy this state of things 
<lb/>over 200 miles - and an Arab ship 
<lb/>built on the Lake to carry slaves over 
<lb/>it. When we came up to the North end 
<lb/>of it the shores were literally strewed 
<lb/>with skeletons and in some parts 
<lb/>putrid bodies of the slain - this was 
<lb/>done by a tribe of Zulus and will 
<lb/>give an idea of how matters stand 
<lb/>where Satan has his seat. I am 
<lb/>exceedingly glad to hear that the Free 
<lb/>Kirk contemplates a mission 
<lb/>in this dark region, and hope that 
<lb/>they will not be discouraged by the 
<lb/>difficulties that beset the undertaking 
<lb/>the London mission tried the 
<lb/>Makololo and when we reached that 
<lb/>country we found that most of the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001699_0003"/><!--pb/@n='03'-->
<lb/>missionaries had perished. Had they 
<lb/>written to me I might have helped 
<lb/>them for we can with God's blessing 
<lb/>cure the fever in a very short time 
<lb/><persName>Charles</persName> for instance had an attack 
<lb/>in the very valley where they helplessly 
<lb/>perished - took the medicine and 
<lb/>next day marched on, but they 
<lb/>did not write and when I arrived 
<lb/>at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> it was but to behold 
<lb/>their graves. All our efforts here 
<lb/>are directed to the eradication of 
<lb/>the slave trade - that is the great 
<lb/>evil here. When we took the bishop 
<lb/>up to shew him where to live in 
<lb/>health we met <placeName>Tette</placeName> people returning 
<lb/>with large bands of captives, these 
<lb/>were freed and about 140 souls 
<lb/>delivered to the mission to begin 
<lb/>school with. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey were chiefly women 
<lb/>and children- their relatives all killed<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Anything is better than heathenism<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>I am astonished that none but three 
<lb/>letters have come to you. I have written 
<lb/>to you by every opportunity except one<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I got one from <persName>Janet</persName> and one from 
<lb/><persName>Agnes</persName> at the end of three years - they 
<lb/>had written none previously because 
<lb/>"tehy did expect any sympathy 
<lb/>from me" I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> one from 
<lb/><persName>Janet</persName> a few days ago = I am going 
<lb/>down to sea for provisions &amp; 
<lb/>a steamer which we expect, to 
<lb/>put on the Lake. I expect also to 
<lb/>meet my wife after our long 
<lb/>weary and unexpected separation<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I would have sent for her long 
<lb/>ago but dreaded exposing her &amp; 
<lb/>the child to the fever in our 
<lb/>wretched accomodation. 
<lb/>With kindest saluations to you 
<lb/>all<reg>.</reg> I am ever Affectionately </p>
