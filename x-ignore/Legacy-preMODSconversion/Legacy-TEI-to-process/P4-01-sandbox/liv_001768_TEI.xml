<lb/><p rend="left"><placeName>Shupanga</placeName> 28 April 1862 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Son Thomas </p>
<lb/><p>Your dear Mama 
<lb/>will never return from the happy 
<lb/>home to which she has gone. We 
<lb/>shall go to her but she will 
<lb/>not come back to us. She died 
<lb/>last night and I am left with 
<lb/>a sore heart alone in the 
<lb/>world. I bow to the heavy 
<lb/>stroke of ouyr Heavenly Father 
<lb/>who does all things well &amp; 
<lb/>pray that he may give me 
<lb/>grace &amp; strength to bear up 
<lb/>against what at present quite 
<lb/>takes the heart out of me. 
<lb/>She was but forty one and I never 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001768_0002"/><!--pb/@n='02'-->
<lb/>saw her look better, and never 
<lb/>enjoyed her society more, but three 
<lb/>short months after our meeting 
<lb/>after four years seperation we 
<lb/>are parted till we meet through 
<lb/>infinite mercy in Heaven. Poor 
<lb/>Dear Mama I weep over you as 
<lb/>well deserving many tears. I laid 
<lb/>her dear form in the grave 
<lb/>a little ago. There she sleeps till 
<lb/>the last trumpet shall sound 
<lb/>and the dead in christ shall rise 
<lb/>with joy. Her body is placed 
<lb/>beneath a large Baobab tree 
<lb/>sixty feet in circumference 
<lb/>mentioned in <persName>Commodore Owen's</persName>
<lb/>book. We must my dear son 
<lb/>feel that Heaven is our true 
<lb/>home and dear good Mama 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001768_0003"/><!--pb/@n='03'-->
<lb/>has just preceded us. She may be 
<lb/>thought of as beckoning you to 
<lb/>come - to flee sin, and lay hold on 
<lb/>Christ. Yes. Christ himself is 
<lb/>beckoning  &amp; inviting you to 
<lb/>come &amp; be saved - don't hold 
<lb/>back, Oy unto god "My father 
<lb/>be thou the guide of my youth" 
<lb/>Embrace Jesus and all your 
<lb/>sins are forgiven. </p>
<lb/><p>Dear dear Mama had but 
<lb/>little pain, he liver refused to 
<lb/>act and the bile mixing with 
<lb/>the blood produced a sort of 
<lb/>stupor and jaundice. 
<lb/>She said 
<lb/>to me as she lay moaning 
<lb/>yesterday morning. "I am not in 
<lb/>pain but have a feeling of 
<lb/>distressing weakness" soon after 
<lb/>that she lost the power of 
<lb/>swallowing, and gradually became 
<lb/>more insensible but answered my 
<lb/>kisses up to within half an hour 
<lb/>of her departure. She was breathing 
<lb/>with her mouth a little open then 
<lb/>shut it gently and breathed no 
<lb/>more. Jesus I trust was with 
<lb/>her but she was deafened by 
<lb/>quinine and I could hold no 
<lb/>conversation with her on the rest 
<lb/>of her soul. It never occured to 
<lb/>me to use writing but on asking 
<lb/>loud if she rested on Jesus she 
<lb/>looked thoughtfully up. I think it 
<lb/>meant yes, but to her previous 
<lb/>life and experience we must 
<lb/>look for comfort. Thomas meet 
<lb/>Mama in Heaven 
<lb/>Don<reg>'</reg>t let sin 
<lb/>cheat you out of that happy meeting 
<lb/>you must go to Christ for your 
<w>-<lb break="no"/>self.</w> And may he be your Friend 
<lb/>&amp; guide, your sorrowing Father<reg>.</reg></p>
