<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>River Shire</placeName> 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> January</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1862</p>
<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear <persName>Sister Janet</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> your second 
<lb/>letter since 1858 a short time ago by 
<lb/>one of the missionaries who came 
<lb/>up this river in a canoe without 
<lb/>knowing a word of the language 
<lb/>or a bit of the way. It is not 
<lb/>likely that the High church mission 
<lb/>will be <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> with favour 
<lb/>by any other sect. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir pretensions 
<lb/>are against the growth of cordiality 
<lb/>but it is a good school they have 
<lb/>come to. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is nobody either to 
<lb/>oppose or laugh at their puerilities 
<lb/>and the Africans will not be 
<lb/>led by anything but the love 
<lb/>of Christ. A Roman catholic 
<lb/>mission far up <placeName>the Nile</placeName> paid 
<lb/>the people to come to prayers and 
<lb/>when their goods were expended 
<lb/>the tribe left <hi rend="underline">en masse</hi> saying 
<lb/>"No beads, no prayers." <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is 
<lb/><persName>Consul Pethericks</persName> statement &amp; 
<lb/>you may take it for what it is 
<lb/>worth. As I am forbidden to 
<lb/>say any-thing in my own defence 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001713_0002"/><!--pb/@n='118v'--> 
<lb/>I submit as meekly as a sucking dove 
<lb/>but like the cabman "I think a great 
<lb/>deal."I even <hi rend="underline">think</hi> that the church 
<lb/>missionary society i.e. the Evangelical 
<lb/>party of the Church of England, to whom 
<lb/>I wrote to occupy the field, might 
<lb/>have answered my letter as civily 
<lb/>as the <persName>bishop of Oxford</persName> did another 
<lb/>epistle long afterwards <add place="above">No answer came.</add> I am very 
<lb/>glad to hear that the free Kirk 
<lb/>contemplates a mission and I 
<lb/>rejoice that the United Free 
<lb/>Methodists are sending a mission 
<lb/>in charge of <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi><unclear cert="medium">Knapf</unclear></persName> to some 
<lb/>point on the East coast. You are 
<lb/>right in thinking I would be much 
<lb/>grieved in hearing of the death of my 
<lb/>dear friends<persName> M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> &amp; M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Helmore.</persName><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>were a noble pair, and I visited 
<lb/>their graves with feelings of deep sorrow<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I grieve much because the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term> are left without the 
<lb/>gospel. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey spoke of <persName>Helmore</persName> with 
<lb/>great respect and affection - and 
<lb/>he was admirably adapted to win 
<lb/>their esteem - they were naturally 
<lb/>dissatisfied with their men being 
<lb/>so long away but said not a word to 
<lb/>me, which shewed a kindly feeling 
<lb/>at least, and the chief seemed very 
<lb/>thankful for medicine for a <term type="ailment">disease</term>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001713_0003"/><!--pb/@n='119r'--> 
<lb/>which possibly is <term type="ailment">leprosy.</term> I am sorry 
<lb/>that <persName>Helmore</persName> never wrote to me nor 
<lb/>did <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Tidman</persName> and when we descended 
<lb/>into the <placeName>Makololo valley</placeName> you may <choice><sic><w>con-<lb break="no"/>cieve</w></sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> the stunning effect of the news 
<lb/>that the missionaries were all dead. </p>
<lb/><p>Our cotton grows wild and when 
<lb/>well planted continues to yield for 
<lb/>several years, with only a weeding 
<lb/>now &amp; then. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he heartbreaking toil 
<lb/>necessary in <placeName>America</placeName> is not needed 
<lb/>here. We have no frosts to endanger the 
<lb/>crop and can buy it for a good deal 
<lb/>less than a penny per pound. We bought 
<lb/>300 lbs of clean cotton as a trial, giving 
<lb/>a foot of calico not worth a halfpenny 
<lb/>for several pounds. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his was not 
<lb/>at the period of the cotton crop either. 
<lb/>But we must have an outlet of our 
<lb/>own away from Portuguese custom 
<lb/>houses and hence our efforts to open 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> - from <placeName>Rovuma.</placeName>
<lb/>It is over 200 miles long - from 
<lb/>20 to 50 or more miles broad, and 
<lb/>exceedingly deep. We shall bend all 
<lb/>our energies to placing a steamer on 
<lb/>it this year and I pray God that 
<lb/>I may be permitted to effect this great 
<lb/>service for then we have highlands 
<lb/>all round <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. It is surrounded 
<lb/>by mountains, and Europeans 
<lb/>can live well up there. I hope then 
<lb/>that our countrymen may both 
<lb/>benefit themselves and the Africans 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001713_0004"/><!--pb/@n='119v'--> 
<lb/>by living among them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he population 
<lb/>around the Lake is prodigiously large 
<lb/>but slaving goes on perpetually either 
<lb/>by barter or by slave hunting - 19,000 
<lb/>pass yearly through the Custom House 
<lb/>of <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> and <persName>Col<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Rigby</persName> our consul 
<lb/>there says they all come from <placeName>Nyassa</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Our plan has a double reference to 
<lb/>slavery in <placeName>Africa</placeName> &amp; elsewhere. We 
<lb/>hope to benefit both <placeName>Africa</placeName> &amp; <placeName>England</placeName>
<lb/>but I need not specify my hopes. 
<lb/>You will however see enough to 
<lb/>let you understand the reasons of 
<lb/>my joy in seeing christians of 
<lb/>different denominations sending 
<lb/>the gospel without which all our 
<lb/>efforts will end in failure. </p>
<lb/><p>Suffer me to hint that your letter 
<lb/>is in a slight degree <persName>Miss Grantish.</persName> I 
<lb/>gave information according to the 
<lb/>varying phases of my experience. If 
<lb/>life was in danger I committed it as 
<lb/>I do now and always to the Divine 
<lb/>keeping. If reputation &amp; usefulness 
<lb/>among the heathen were endangered by 
<lb/>false bretheren I spoke of it even as 
<lb/><persName>St Paul</persName> did long before me. I was 
<lb/>distressed but not weeping as he was<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Â£60 a year will be given if I have it 
<lb/>but how could I know you would 
<lb/>not work when you never wrote to 
<lb/>tell me. I think my letters were written 
<lb/>in a Christian spirit but it is questionable 
<lb/>if they were thus <choice><sic>received</sic><corr>recieved</corr></choice><persName>D. Livingstone</persName></p><addSpan spanTo="#addEnd1-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of pp. 118r-119r and the left and right margins of 119v'--></addSpan>
<lb/><p>A happy New year to you all. Try and write a more 
<lb/>loving letter next time without saying that you love me as 
<lb/>much as ever 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001713_0005"/><!--pb/@n='118v'--> 
<lb/>You were, utterly inexcusable in not writing - I left orders that in

<lb/>any case of distress you were to be at once <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> - running into 
<lb/>debt by borrowing when you had no prospect of being able to pay was my distress

<lb/>&amp; It was never intended that you were to be kept idle on the money intended 
<lb/>for mother. You might have told your distress to me as easily as
