<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>River Shire</placeName> 20 February </p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1863 </p>
<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear <persName>Robert</persName></p>
<lb/><p>In ascending this river 
<lb/>with the <term type="boat">Lady Nyassa</term> in tow alongside, 
<lb/>we had no difficulty till we got to the 
<lb/><placeName>Elephant marsh</placeName>, and there in sudden 
<lb/>bends we found it an <choice><sic>ackward</sic><corr>awkward</corr></choice> matter 
<lb/>to get along, for two vessels cannot be 
<lb/>turned so quickly as one, and <term type="boat">Lady 
<lb/>Nyassa</term> being pretty deep would go 
<lb/>aground, and was very difficult to 
<lb/>get off. Further up the river had risen 
<lb/>only one foot eleven inches instead of 
<lb/>about three feet, so we have lost 
<lb/>more time than we anticipated. But 
<lb/>no important work is ever 
<w>accom-<lb break="no"/>plished</w> without considerable trouble. </p>
<lb/><p>We found that slave hunting and 
<lb/>famine had produced fearful effects 
<lb/>during our absence. We counted about 
<lb/>thirty two dead bodies floating down 
<lb/>as we came up. The smiling villages 
<lb/>where we could last year have bought 
<lb/>any amount of provisions are now 
<lb/>all burned and we saw only a few 
<lb/>starving people trying to save themselves 
<lb/>from starving by fishing and collecting 
<lb/>the seeds of grasses. Indeed our work 
<lb/>will be greatly increased for now 
<lb/>we must get all our provisions for 
<lb/>ourselves &amp; workmen from great distances 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001885_0002"/><!--pb/@n='21v'-->
<lb/>to me this retension of the slave trade is 
<lb/>a great affliction. It destroys my hopes 
<lb/>of benefitting the natives of the <placeName>lower 
<lb/>Shire</placeName>, and I only trust that we may do 
<lb/>some good service on <placeName>Lake Nyassa.</placeName>
<lb/>The <placeName>Tette</placeName> people began the work of depopulation 
<lb/>on our footsteps, then a half caste called 
<lb/><persName>Mariano</persName> devasted the country around 
<lb/><placeName>Mount Clarendon.</placeName> The loss of life has 
<lb/>been fearful. Others have made slave 
<lb/>forays in other directions, and no 
<lb/>Governor interferes until the culprit 
<lb/>is rich enough to be squeezed. He is 
<lb/>fined and allowed to begin again at 
<lb/>his old trade of slave hunting. The 
<lb/>reason why no resistance can be 
<lb/>made by the people themselves is 
<lb/>Bows and arrows are nothing to guns 
<lb/>and anyone with a few muskets &amp; 
<lb/>slaves may begin slavehunting. 
<lb/>On the west coast <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName>
<lb/>put a squadron of men of war to stop 
<lb/>the slave trade, and allow civilisation 
<lb/>to begin its operations. Twenty missions 
<lb/>were established, and twenty dialects 
<lb/>reduced to writing. some twelve thousand 
<lb/>communicants have been <choice><sic>received</sic><corr>recieved</corr></choice>
<lb/>into different churches, and thousands 
<lb/>are educated. Good influences are 
<lb/>spreading inland so that the lawful 
<lb/>trade is increased from £20,000 per 
<lb/>annum to between £2,000,000 &amp; £3,000,000 
<lb/>More ships are employed in carrying it

<!--hand1top right 22-->than ever were engaged in the slave trade. 
<lb/>I think <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName> has done more 
<lb/>for Africa than any man who has 
<lb/>appeared, and he did it in spite of much 
<lb/>misrepresentation. I have heard men say 
<lb/>that the squadron rather increased than 
<lb/>diminished the horrors of the slave trade, 
<lb/>Even officers said they were doing more 
<lb/>harm than good. He persevered in 
<lb/>spite of it all, and is an example 
<lb/>you should copy. Take a right course 
<lb/>and go through with it whatever 
<lb/>men may say or think. Well while 
<lb/>all that was doing on the <placeName>West coast,</placeName>
<lb/>nothing has been doing here, because 
<lb/>only a few convicts have been 
<w>intro-<lb break="no"/>duced,</w> and we can see reason to fear 
<lb/>that even our efforts will be frustrated. 
<lb/>the Universities Mission is driven 
<lb/>into an unhealthy corner by slave 
<lb/>hunting. the parsons who joined it 
<lb/>finding it much more difficult 
<lb/>work than they imagined would 
<lb/>like to be well out of it. but never 
<lb/>mind, others will take up the work. 
<lb/>The sway of Satan can't be for ever, 
<lb/>and He will come whose right 
<lb/>it is to reign. they had a number 
<lb/>of black men from the <placeName>cape</placeName> who 
<lb/>turned out badly, and altogether they 
<lb/>have found it far from being sailing 
<lb/><gap extent="80" unit="mm" agent="damage"/><supplied resp="#CL">stream</supplied>. It has been uphill 
<lb/>work.

<lb/>As it always in at the commencement 
<lb/>of missions in uncivilized parts. It was 
<lb/>so with <persName>Grandfather Moffats</persName> mission as 
<lb/>you may have read in his book </p>
<lb/><p>We expect a <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Jehan</persName> a missionary 
<lb/>and five Scotch mechanics to join us 
<lb/>After reading my book they resolved 
<lb/>to work at their trades in the Cape 
<lb/>colony their wages going to a common 
<lb/>fund. they bought a waggon and 
<lb/>intended to proceed over land to us 
<lb/>but the <persName>Governor of the Cape</persName> wrote 
<lb/>to ask me about sending them by 
<lb/>a man of war to the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> and 
<lb/>I agreed to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> them. They are by 
<lb/>trade a smith 2 masons &amp; 2 carpenters 
<lb/>and should they give an example of 
<lb/><choice><sic>of</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> industry and christian life to the 
<lb/>people on the Lake they may do much 
<lb/>good </p>
<lb/><p>Let your brothers and sister read this 
<lb/>but I don't wish it to be shewn to 
<lb/>others. I shall write to <persName>Oswell</persName> a good 
<lb/>long letter like this next. I am expecting 
<lb/>letters from you all soon. Think 
<lb/>of dear <persName>Mama</persName> as seeing you all 
<lb/>and above all of Jesus our Lord 
<lb/>who knows our hearts and all our 
<lb/>ways. Kiss <persName>Anna Mary</persName> for me 
<lb/>and may the Lord bless you all 
<lb/>&amp; put you for his service </p><!--autograph signature missing-->
