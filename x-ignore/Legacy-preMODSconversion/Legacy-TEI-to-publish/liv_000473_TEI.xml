<lb/><p rend="right">At Sea, off <placeName>Rio De Janeiro</placeName>, 27<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> Jan<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">y</hi></hi></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1840</p>
<lb/><p>Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p>The sudden &amp; unexpected departure 
<lb/>of out Pilot at midnight rendered it impossible 
<lb/>for us to write you from the Downs. But as 
<lb/>we shall have an opportunity tomorrow of 
<lb/>transmitting letters to England, you will have 
<lb/>the kindness to take this instead.</p>
<lb/><p>We expect to reach <placeName>Rio D' Janeiro</placeName> tomorrow 
<lb/>to which Port we are compelled to put in, in 
<lb/>consequence of our foremast having been 
<lb/>split by the wind a few days ago. We had 
<lb/>only 30 days water on board when the accident 
<lb/>happened and had we proceeded on our 
<lb/>course to the Cape, the probability is that the 
<lb/>first gale we encountered, taking the mast right 
<lb/>away, should have so disabled the vessel as 
<lb/>prevent her gaining land for perhaps double that 
<lb/>time. As a prudential measure therefore the 
<lb/>Captain puts in at the above named Port to get a 
<lb/>new mast or the old one repaired &amp; a supply of 
<lb/>water. These objects we hope to get accomplished 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000473_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>in a few days</p>
<lb/><p>We should have preferred proceeding direct to our 
<lb/>destination without delay. But as circumstances have 
<lb/>so happened, we feel pleased with the prospect of 
<lb/>visiting that harbour. And as the Tract Society 
<lb/>kindly furnished us with a good supply tracts for 
<lb/>distribution we purpose supplying our countrymen 
<lb/>connected with the British shipping with what we 
<lb/>have left over the supply of our own vessel<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>And if there is an hospital for seamen, by leaving some there, we hope that some of these little messengers 
<lb/>of mercy may impart consolation &amp; hope to some who 
<lb/>in health never listened to the invitations of the 
<lb/>gospel, and if so our short visit wont be 
<lb/>in vain</p>
<lb/><p>We had cold stormy weather for 10 days 
<lb/>after leaving <placeName>Gravesend</placeName>, but having then reached 
<lb/>the latitude of Lisbon we experienced a pleasant 
<lb/>change &amp; ever since we have been favoured 
<lb/>with a most delightful Atmosphere. We have 
<lb/>frequently thought of you &amp; wished that the enjoyment of these climates &amp; the discharge of the important 
<lb/>duties of your office were compatible. <choice><reg>Y</reg><orig>y</orig></choice>ou now 
<lb/>suffer severely from the cold fogs of London, while 
<lb/>we enjoy weather much more genial than even 
<lb/>summer in England. We hope however you 
<lb/>are able with some degree of comfort, still to 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000473_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>discharge your very arduous duties</p>
<lb/><p>We have held Divine Service as often as the 
<lb/>weather permitted. But no change for the better 
<lb/>is apparent. We feel that much wisdom is 
<lb/>requisite in dealing with sailors. May this be 
<lb/>imparted to us so that our sojourn with them 
<lb/>may be for the glory of our Redeemer.</p>
<lb/><p>Our accommodation is much better than 
<lb/>we expected. Indeed we have great reason to 
<lb/>be grateful to the Giver of all good &amp; to the Directors 
<lb/>as his instruments for the very many comforts 
<lb/>we enjoy. We hope our mercies may <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/><supplied reason="damage">not</supplied>
<lb/>be lost upon us, but that we may be stimulated 
<lb/>by them to greater devotedness in the cause of Him 
<lb/>who leads us with his <choice><sic>benifits</sic><corr>benefits</corr></choice>. &amp; <choice><reg>a</reg><orig>A</orig></choice>t the same 
<lb/>time honours us to go forth to the heathen with 
<lb/>the good news of mercy through Christ.</p>
<lb/><p>Yours in the bonds of the gospel</p>
