<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear Sir</p> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>Your most welcome letter I found a few days ago on
<br/>returning from a tour in the <span class="">Interior</span>, and I assure you the perusal
<br/>of it afforded me a great amount of enjoyment. Every topic
<br/>to which you advert is interesting, indeed everything from home
<br/>is peculiarly so. Just like cold water to a thirsty soul, so you
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>must not imagine it was unworthy "a passage <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> the <span class="">Atlantic</span>"
<br/>I thank you heartily for it and earnestly hope you may find
<br/>it convenient soon to give me just such another</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am not surprised you have not seen any account of my
<br/>labours in <span class="">the magazine</span>, the reasons are, I am not yet settled, the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">Directors</span> expecting their <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> would soon follow instructed
<br/>me to remain at <span class="">Kuruman</span> till his arrival, and this in <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: order">oder</span> to
<br/>obtain the benefit of his local knowledge of the country in the choice 
<br/>of a suitable location for a new mission. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M</span>'s departure
<br/>having been delayed my labours have been mixed with those of
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the elder missionaries. Good has been done but as I believe
<br/>it has been effected chiefly through the instrumentality of my
<br/>predecessors I have not felt at liberty to advert to it in <span class="">my letters</span>
<br/>to the <span class="">Directors</span> except in a vague &amp; general manner; I have
<br/>also examined the country for myself &amp; been much farther 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>into the <span class="">Interior</span> than any other <span class="">European</span> &amp; preached the glad
<br/>tidings of mercy beyond every other man's line of things But
<br/>these labours have <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">been</span> all of a preparatory nature. Nothing permanent
<br/>has been effected. But now in company of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> of
<br/>this mission I expect very soon to commence a station
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>among the Bakhatla, they are situated very near the spot
<br/>where <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span> faced about to go home and, the iron
<br/>founderies which he heard of but was not permitted to see
<br/>belong to them. The reason he was forbidden the sight of them
<br/>was a foolish idea that his presence would bewitch
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the iron. No one dare approach them who has had intercourse
<br/>with the other sex since the commencement of the season in
<br/>which they work it. He would certainly bewitch it, I who
<br/>am yet in a state of single blessedness can examine them as
<br/>I like, and I assure you it is difficult to maintain my
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>gravity when I see iron bewitched. If they use their bellows
<br/>too briskly having no lime in their furnaces, the iron becomes
<br/>burned to a cinder. They take out that &amp; looking upon it in
<br/>consternation exclaim behold the effects of witchcraft. The evidence
<br/>is so clear no one doubts it. They then apply a double portion
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>of their prophylactic against witchcraft &amp; begin the process again</p>
<br/>
<br/><p class="ab ">This is a <span class="">parvum in multo letter</span> but you must its many blunders, my sentences sometimes come tailforwards as in
<br/>Sichuana &amp; require many corrections Will you be so kind as  present my Christian regards to your much respected father &amp; mother &amp; to your partner
<br/>with whom I hope you will long live in much domestic happiness. Believe me yours affectionately <span class="">D Livingston</span></p>

<br/><p class="p ">Our station will be about a day beyond the spot where <span class="">Mosilikatze</span>
<br/>was seen by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span>. I lately walked over the site of his town &amp; 
<br/>the field where he suffered such a dreadful defeat by a handful
<br/>of Dutch <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boors</span></span>, the grass had recently been burned off the country 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>so I could obtain a good view of the whole and a very few human
<br/>bones were all I could discover of what belonged to the tyrant. He is
<br/>still alive &amp; continues his career of blood. He lives at a distance
<br/>at least <span class="">300 miles</span> north east of that now. But last year
<br/>he sent out a marauding party to the Bakwain, Wanketze
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>&amp; other tribes and there committed great excesses upon them
<br/>Besides great slaughter of the males they plundered these tribes
<br/>of all their cattle &amp; took many of the women &amp; children captive
<br/><span class="">Makabba</span> who was the terror of the <span class="">Interior</span> in <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span>'s time
<br/>has been succeeded by a son called <span class="">Sebegwe</span>, who is the bravest
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of all the Bechuanas. <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> could never overcome him
<br/>for he retired into the great <span class="">Bakalihari desert</span> &amp; there by his
<br/>tactics cut off detachment after detachment of <span class=""><span class="">Mosilikatze</span>'s
<br/>people</span>, sometimes he finished them so completely not one
<br/>returned to tell the tale. Last year when I was in the <span class="">Bakwain
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>country</span> <span class="">Sebegwe</span> sent messengers to me to say that he was
<br/>now anxious to leave the desert &amp; return to his own country 
<br/>&amp; requested me to tell him if it might be a safe movement. I
<br/>told him although the <span class="">people of <span class="">Mosilikatze</span></span> had been driven away
<br/>many of the Batlapi (people of <span class="">Kuruman</span>) refused the gospel
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>&amp; having now got guns would certainly attack him for the
<br/>sake of his cattle. Several of the <span class="">believers of <span class="">Kuruman</span></span>
<br/>happened to be in that country at the time when S. contrary to 
<br/>my advice did leave the desert, they visited him &amp; were 
<br/>most kindly <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> but unfortunately during the very time
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of their visit <span class="">Mahura</span> with his Batlapi pounced upon them
<br/>The <span class="">people of <span class="">Sebegwe</span></span> being quite unused to guns fled in dismay
<br/>&amp; the Batlapi murdered as they chose The <span class="">believers</span> although
<br/>commanded by <span class="">Mahura</span> to fire refused obedience to their chief
<br/>on the ground that they served a higher master than he. But as
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>they are Batlapi a most injurious prejudice was excited
<br/>in the minds of all the <span class="">natives</span> in the <span class="">Interior</span> against the
<br/><span class="">gospel</span> by the circumstances in which they were placed at the
<br/>time. A gun had been fired the night previous to the attack
<br/>This <span class="">Sebegwe</span> thought must have been the signal by which
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>these <span class="">believers</span> apprised <span class="">Mahura</span> of his situation. The singing
<br/>at family worship their incantations for success, and
<br/>the fact that one of the party a deacon in the church here
<br/>was in the act of collecting the people for <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: overwriting">[      ]</span></span> worship 
<br/>(it being Sabbath morning when the attack was made) when the

       <span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>shout of war was heard was considered by all the <span class="">heathen</span> as only a <span class="addmargin"> [17] </span>
<br/>pretext by which to aid the work of slaughter. The <span class="">believers</span> it was
<br/>universally believed had been the betrayers of the brave <span class="">Sebegwe</span>. The
<br/>object of my last tour which commenced on the <span class="">21<span class="sup ">st</span> Feb'y last</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>was by my presence &amp; explanations to disabuse the minds of
<br/>the <span class="">heathen</span> &amp; particularly that of <span class="">Sebegwe</span> of the unfavourable
<br/>impression <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>. He with the remains of his tribe live at
<br/>a village <span class="">10 days <span class="unclear">N E</span> of this</span> &amp; near to the towns of the Bakhatla
<br/>The driver of my waggon was one of the <span class="">party of believers</span> above
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>referred to. When I entered the village <span class="">Sebegwe</span> with his remaining
<br/>warriors was seated on the ground I squatted down beside him
<br/>But neither looks nor words betokened complacency to my
<br/>driver who during a most uproarious recognition looked
<br/>anything but comfortable. <span class="">Sebegwe</span> demanded of me why I
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>had destroyed all <span class="">his people</span> &amp; stolen all his cattle. I being a
<br/>Scotchman returned for answer Why did you refuse to
<br/>listen to my advice &amp; then destroy yourself. His messenger
<br/>of <span class="">last year</span> then recognized <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">him</span> me &amp; we were soon good
<br/>friends He said he had lost so many of his people by
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>fever, while <span class="add  above">in</span> the neighbourhood of the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">Lake Mokhoro</span></span> He
<br/>had not a sufficiency to attend to his vast herds of cattle
<br/>and his desire to sow corn again with his ignorance of
<br/>the power of guns <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">had</span> induced him to leave the desert 
<br/>contrary to my advice. During the whole of my visit he
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>behaved in a most friendly manner, one instance I may
<br/>relate Having arrived on a Saturday I explained the nature of
<br/>the following day &amp; desired to have an opportunity to address
<br/>his people, next morning before daybreak I heard his
<br/>herald proclaiming the chief's orders that no one
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>should do anything that day but "pray to God &amp; listen to
<br/>the words of the <span class="">foreigner</span>" At the different services he
<br/>seemed much interested &amp; frequently asked sensible questions
<br/>concerning the strange things I had brought to his ears.
<br/>By the way I may mention here that fevers seem the great-
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>-est barrier to the evangelization of <span class="">Africa</span> we have. A
<br/>short distance beyond my farthest point north there is a fresh
<br/>water lake call <span class="">Mokhoro</span> or the <span class="">lake of the boat</span> on account
<br/>of the canoes which are found upon it. The banks are level
<br/>with the water &amp; the surrounding country flat, Hippopotami
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>alligators, fish &amp;c abound in it. Bamboo &amp; other reeds <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, "><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">abound</span></span> <span class="add  above">grow</span> 
<br/>on its banks. There fevers abound, and this lake stretches 
<br/>away an immense distance to the North East &amp; south west
<br/>A small boat carried to it would be an excellent mode of
<br/>exploring a large portion of the <span class="">interior</span>. Many nations

        <span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>live upon its banks &amp; trade upon its waters. They are armed
<br/>with guns which they procure from Portuguese on the <span class="">East
<br/>coast</span>. I hear <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> intends visiting this lake I hope he 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> fall a victim to its fever. <span class="">Last year</span> a strong <span class="">native</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>who accompanied me was <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: seized">siezed</span> with it &amp; I had great
<br/>difficulty in getting him through it. The effects however
<br/>are still apparent upon him. This to the North &amp; N.W. and
<br/>then to the N. East we have a fly which bites the oxen and <span class="weather ">the
<br/>very first rain that falls afterwards</span> seems to excite its
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>poison to activity for they all die. Several traders have
<br/>lost every one of their oxen by them. And then towards
<br/><span class="">the coast</span> at <span class="">De Lagoa Bay</span> fevers are exceedingly fatal,
<br/>Several parties of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boors</span></span> have been cut off by them, I have anxiously
<br/>looked for an account of that which cut off so many of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class=""><span class="">Niger</span> expedition</span> in order to compare it with this case of it which
<br/>I saw. But it has not appeared in any periodical that has
<br/>come my way yet</p>
<br/><p class="p ">After parting with <span class="">Sebegwe</span> I went northwards to the <span class="">Bakw
<br/>-ain country</span> which is situated on the tropic &amp; meeting some of
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the <span class="">escaped captives</span> there my people would go no farther. The
<br/>idea of going near <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> was too much for them
<br/>Their hearts were ready to die within them so I left them
<br/>in charge of the waggon &amp; proceeded on oxback. I think I
<br/>see you smile at the idea of such a conveyance. It is rough
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>travelling as you can <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span>. The skin is so loose there is no
<br/>getting <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: one's">ones</span> great coat which has to serve for both saddle &amp; blanket
<br/>to stick on And then the long horns in front with which he
<br/>can give one a punch in the abdomen if he likes make us sit
<br/>as "bolt upright" as <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">a</span> dragoons. In this manner I travelled
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="">more than 400 miles</span>. I visited the Bamangwato Bakaa &amp;
<br/>Makalaka and many villages of the poor <span class="">enslaved Bakalihari</span>
<br/>which but for this mode of travelling I should never have
<br/>seen. These villages are usually so far in the desert no 
<br/>waggon can approach them. They are much oppressed by
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the other <span class="">Bechuana tribes</span> All the skins which the other tribes
<br/>sew into Karosses are procured by them &amp; yet they can scarcely
<br/>keep as much of what they kill as cover their oxen
<br/>bodies. They always live far from water in order to avoid coming
<br/>in contact with their masters. (the other tribes consider them inferior)
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>yet their wants are wonderfully supplied by Providence. They
<br/>have shown me between 40 &amp; 50 different kinds of roots &amp;
<br/>more than 30 different kinds of fruits which they use as food
<br/>&amp; some of them are by no means unsavoury. They were more
<br/>attentive to my instructions than any other which made me feel much a

		
    	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>             
<br/>interested in them. The other tribes mentioned above live on the summits of
<br/>a range of lofty bleak basaltic rocks, once the scene of active volcanic
<br/>operations When standing on their tops we see in every direction immense
<br/>cup shaped cavities, some of them as large as <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Finsbury">Finsburys</span> Square</span> &amp; about 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">300 feet deep</span>, their flat bottoms are covered with vegetation but
<br/>their almost perpendicular sides have not yet formed a vegetable mantle
<br/>While on the outside patches of the same colour &amp; destitute of vegetation
<br/>take the form of streams running down to the plains below, some
<br/>end in a point half way down the hill, others gain the bottom &amp; then
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>spread out just as we may suppose streams of lava would do
<br/>These rocks are rent &amp; rivening in every direction. The huge angular
<br/>fragments which have slipped down have by impinging on each
<br/>other &amp; the rocks below formed innumerable cavities and into these
<br/>the Bamangwato, Bakaa &amp; Makalaka fly for shelter from their
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>fierce enemies the Matibele of <span class="">Mosilikatsze</span>. One which I entered
<br/>could hold a hundred individuals, &amp; the entrance was so small &amp;
<br/>crooked a dozen men within could stand &amp; defend it against the
<br/>ingress of a single individual, crawling in on all fours. Into another
<br/>a whole village entered, &amp; when the Matibele besieged one entrance
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the people had another by which at night they went to draw
<br/>water &amp; bring wood for cooking. The Bakaa have a bad name
<br/>among all the other tribes because a few years ago they killed
<br/>a trader &amp; all his people by poison. When I visited them <span class="">last year</span>
<br/>I saw pieces of his gun locks, tin jugs &amp; sailcloth of his waggon
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>worn as ornaments by them. <span class="">Last year</span> a <span class="">native</span> who was
<br/>with me became ill during our visit to them, the man himself &amp;
<br/>all the other tribes believe he was poisoned. I however do not believe
<br/>it for I saw symptoms of indisposition before we arrived there
<br/>The Bakaa determined <span class="">this year</span> to give us nothing at all &amp; thus
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>avoid a similar imputation. There was no game near so we
<br/>had to feast for two days on the delectable things we saw
<br/>in our dreams. This low diet had a good effect on me for
<br/>when descending their lofty rocks after having addressed them
<br/>I felt so much interested in the questions they were putting
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>concerning what they had heard I forgot for a moment
<br/>where I was going and then feeling as if about to fall
<br/>made a violent effort to save myself. But though I succeeded
<br/>I struck my hand with so much violence on a sharp angle
<br/>as produced a compound fracture of the finger bone. The testam
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>ment served as a rest between which &amp; <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">the rock</span> my finger was
<br/>injured, &amp; a very good splint was made of a piece of reed. The
<br/>fasting I suppose prevented irritative fever and although I did
<br/>not rest a day on account of it, it was about to heal <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">kindly</span>
<br/>But one night a lion began to roar most tremendously
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>&amp; very near to the bush at which we were all fast asleep. It was
<br/>nearer than from your room in the dispensary to the open street
<br/>My ox leapt in among us. My poor Bakwains shrieked for fear
<br/>and I half awake &amp; stupid <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: seized">siezed</span> a pistol with the disabled hand fired
<br/>at the monster but the rebound rebroke my finger. When we
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>got him driven away the poor Bakwains (three of that tribe
<br/>went with me as guides my own people being all with the waggon) seeing the
    
         <span class="pb-title">0006</span>               
<br/>blood running, said, "You have hurt yourself but you have redeemed us
<br/>Henceforth we shall swear by you" O that they knew the value of
<br/>the blood which was shed for the redemption of their souls. The
<br/>second fracture was worse than the first but as I can bear a little
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>pain pretty well it did not hinder me so much as I expected it should
<br/>It prevented my obtaining provisions by my gun, and the whole party
<br/>being entirely <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: dependent">dependant</span> on it we should have been put to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">shifts</span> had
<br/>it not been for the kindness of the Bakalihari. They generously
<br/>gave what food they had, and although some of it is absolutely
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>indigestible &amp; undergoes no alteration by being subjected to the
<br/>actions of the stomach, I never enjoyed better health. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>

<br/>are the most constipating food I ever ate. They taste just like
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the vegetables on which they subsist, generally more like the soft
<br/>juicy part of a stalk of wheat which perhaps you may have
<br/>tasted &amp; far better than shrimps at home. The wild honey
<br/>has the very opposite tendency, the two combined form one
<br/> the best kinds of food the Bakalihari have. We find the honey

<br/>They call us by a peculiar kind of chirping &amp; following it we very
<br/>seldom are disappointed. I have followed them <span class="">4 or 5 miles</span>

<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>respecting sending anything large. I intend sending with the other
<br/>things a skin of a springbuck. It is the most beautiful of
<br/>all the antelope tribe &amp; will make an elegant ornament to

<br/>I am sure when you see it you will not grudge it a
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>corner. To the other things I shall make additions and as
<br/>soon as a conveyance can be got down to the <span class="">Bay (Algoa)</span>
<br/>I shall dispatch them for you. I send in the course of a
<br/>few months a box to <span class="">Rev<span class="sup ">d</span> E. Williams</span> of <span class="unclear"><span class="">Hankey</span></span> who

<br/>should be of frequent occurrence. I have however never

<br/>I find it is exceedingly rare among the <span class="">native<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">s</span> children</span> while among
<br/>the children of <span class="">Europeans</span> it is as common as <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">meningitis</span>
<br/>During a period of twelve years <span class="">Mrs Edwards</span> a very accurate observer
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of these matters has only seen one case of it. Having seen the
<br/>disease <span class="add  above">in <span class="">European children</span></span> &amp; being well acquainted with its symptoms I think her
<br/>testimony can be relied on. Whilst during a shorter period
<br/>of observation and among the <span class="">Mission families</span> (French &amp; English)
<br/>not amounting to 40 individuals in all I am informed no fewer
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>than 4 infants have fallen <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: victims">victimes</span> to that disease. You remark
<br/>"that it is probable Hydrocephalus does not often appear among
<br/>the <span class="">natives</span>" from this &amp; other corroboration of your view which
<br/>my enquiries seem to elicit I infer whatever your views of
<br/>the cause of that disease may be they seem to be correct. I <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">feel</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>most anxious to know what they are &amp; next time I <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">write</span>
<br/>I shall remember yours for the sake of ascertaining</p>
<br/><p class="p ">With respect to consumption, I saw it prevailing very
<br/>extensively among the Hottentots especially those near the <span class="">sea
<br/>coast</span>. This <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">region</span> <span class="add  above">district</span> is reputed in the <span class="">colony</span> as peculiarly favourable
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>for the cure of that disease. I have made many enquiries
<br/>on the subject &amp; the only reasons for the idea are the follow
<br/>Two individuals are reported to have been nearly in the last 
<br/>stage but having removed to this part of the country now 
<br/>lost every symptom of Phthisis &amp; are now living in perfect
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>health. One is a Hottentot &amp; the other a Motchuana, the
<br/>former I have not seen but the latter I had <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">under my</span>
<br/>care for enlargement of the right ovary with shooting pains
<br/>&amp; tenderness in the situation of the other. She <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">told me</span>  got married
<br/>soon after her arrival here from the <span class="">colony</span>, became pregnant
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>&amp; was delivered of a still born child before the usual period
<br/>Soon after that event pains commenced in the right ovary &amp; not long
<br/>after that she felt the tumour which was <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">now</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">at commencement of my <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">treatment last year</span></span> about the size of a large
<br/>fist, &amp; visible to the eye on looking at the abdomen, and it continued to increase
<br/>for several years. About twelve months before I saw her the pains
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>shifted from the right to the left, but, no swelling took place. I
<br/>gave her Lugol's solution of iodine internally in large doses, with
<br/>occasionally a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Plummer's">Plummers</span> pill, and applied a large mercurial
<br/>plaster over the situation of the tumour and in the space of
<br/>three months the pains in the left &amp; swelling in the right had
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>entirely disappeared. I examined the lungs frequently with the stethoscope
<br/>but could discover nothing to indicate they had ever been the seat of
    
                 <span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>tubercle. I was at first disposed to think that possibly her former
<br/>medical attendant had been <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: deceived">decieved</span> in his diagnosis &amp; that the case
<br/>might have been one of Bronchitis rather than of Phthisis But I find
<br/>she was under the care of <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Chalmers</span> of <span class="">Algoa Bay</span>, who seems well acq-
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>-uainted with the use of the stethoscope, one of his own lungs being completely
<br/>condensed - the effect of pleuritis, &amp; the other frequently attacked with bronch
<br/>-itis have led him to a careful investigation of lung diseases. So there
<br/>is the less probability of a mistake having been made. I ought to have
<br/>mentioned that  is now 9 or 10 years since she left the <span class="">colony</span> on account
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of bad health. She is now strong &amp; if I could in answer to her
<br/>importunate begging, give her medicine to enable her to get a child she
<br/>would be one of the happiest of women. Perhaps this case may
<br/>
<br/>be accounted for by the same mode of reasoning as the arrest of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the progress of consumption for a time by pregnancy. The <span class="weather ">salubrity of the
<br/>climate</span> helping to complete the cure. Among Bechuanas I have only seen
<br/>one case of consumption, she lives <span class="">about 50 miles</span> from this &amp; has been
<br/>about 2 years ill &amp; is now much spent. I regret I have not had an oppor
<br/>-tunity of treating her, for if any climate would assist the curative effects
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of medicines I believe this would. <span class="weather ">It is dry, not excessively hot during
<br/>summer &amp; the winters are bracing</span>. It differs much from that of the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>And a journey is almost always beneficial to <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">ind</span> invalids. The <span class="">Indian officers</span>
<br/>who come here are usually quite fat before they come this length, <span class="weather ">the
<br/>chief excellence of this climate I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> are its dryness &amp; almost entire
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>absence of sudden changes of temperature. The cold weather comes on
<br/>very gradually &amp; when it is warm during summer the nights are also
<br/>warm &amp; except immediately after rain which however seldom falls
<br/>we never see dew</span>. I slept during my oxback journey for three weeks and
<br/>4 days on the sand with only my great coat over me &amp; a little grass under

<br/>I have not seen one well marked case of scrofula
<br/>among Bechuanas. One resembled it but I am not
<br/>sure he was of <span class="">pure Bechuana blood</span>. Among Griquas &amp;
<br/>Hottentots it is common. I <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">shall</span> write you again soon
