<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 3 words ">                        </span>The enclosed letter
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for <span class="">Ms Mackenzie</span> I should like you
<br/>to read it as it will give you my views
<br/>and mind about renewing the mission
<br/>to the Makololo - I mention that I have
<br/>requested you to do so to save writing
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the same thing over again - We are 
<br/>ready to go up <span class="">Shire</span> and the mail is
<br/>to start for <span class="">Quillimane</span> directly -</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I enclose a photograph by <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span>
<br/>Kirk</span> of the resting place of my dear
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">Mary</span> - We have not the proper
<br/>chemicals to make it back - I placed
<br/>a cross over her tomb a sacred
<br/>symbol in these regions and
<br/>have sent for a grave stone with
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>The inscription on<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, ">e</span> one side English
<br/>and on the other Portuguese "Here
<br/>repose the mortal remains of

<br/><span class="">27<span class="sup underline ">th</span> April 1862</span> aged 41 years" - 
<br/>This has been a spot of much
<br/>sorrow to me Well do I remember
<br/>the feelings with which I looked at

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>the red <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">tiled building</span> in which she died when
<br/>I sailed down the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">broad</span> river in 1856
<br/>Possibly at some other spot which I have
<br/>already passed I must lie down &amp; die -
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>she would welcome <span class="">Robert</span> and I hope
<br/>will come forward &amp; greet more of us 
<br/>into the house of many mansions
<br/>However now we must be up and
<br/>doing our duty - We have been detained 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>here a full fortnight shifting the top
<br/>to the bottom <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">brasses</span> of the paddle shafts
<br/>We met <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">s</span> Procter</span> the head of
<br/>the <span class="">church mission</span> - He has improved
<br/>wonderfully - was thankful for the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Alphabet you sent - He means to 
<br/>cut out x and put in z which they
<br/>have in their tongue - they teach it
<br/>Fee gee Hee ee jee Lee - mee &amp;c. and
<br/>think it easier - They are working
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>at a primer and will send it to the
<br/><span class="">Cape</span> I suppose - the black men
<br/>brought from the <span class="">Cape</span> have turned
<br/>out badly - Great professors there
<br/>worthless blackguards - A white
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>man imposed on them as an engineer
<br/>guilty of stealing ststematically wished
<br/>me to take him - or give him my
<br/>protection in the country as he repented
<br/>of his sin - I advised him to take himself
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>away where his crime was unknown 
<br/>and there begin by turning over an

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>an entirely new leaf - the Makololo have <span class="add gray above">114</span>
<br/>seen those blackguards and have learned
<br/>no good I fear - <span class="">Earl Russell</span> approved
<br/>all my doings so you may trust me
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to go in at these vile slave hunters
<br/>again if we can - I have just been 
<br/>giving him an account of the way
<br/>in which one side of the <span class="">Shire</span>
<br/>100 a week are taken away and on
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the other <span class="space" title="space: 1 chars ">  </span>the whole country is devastated
<br/>by the fire and sword - Famine has 
<br/>followed the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">flight</span> of the Manganja
<br/>from their well cultivated fields &amp;
<br/>more die of hunger than of the sword
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>many sell themselves and children
<br/>to keep themselves from starving
<br/>A silly fellow <span class="">Rowley</span> has said in a 
<br/><span class=""><span class="">Cape</span> paper</span> that I hunted the Ajawa
<br/>everywhere and set the missionaries
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>on against them - that I had a 
<br/>pitched battle with them all maka hela
<br/>We ran away and left the bishop
<br/>in the battle and our two quarter
<br/>masters and engineer who were there
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>reported it and we laughed &amp; raised 
<br/><span class="">Rowley</span>'s bile - <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Glover</span> who
<br/>published it wrote me an apology
<br/>and I take no notice of it but
<br/><span class="">Rowley</span> will not hear the last of it
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>soon - I hunted the Portuguese and
<br/>hoped to bring matters to a head by
<br/>their complaining to our <span class="">govern 
<br/>ment</span> against me but they know 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>better, and this silly letter puts the case as
<br/>between one tribe and another and not
<br/>between us and the Portuguese - But we 
<br/>shall come out clean at last - I hope the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>new bishop will be a man among
<br/>men and not a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">dane<span class="del-by-over-text" title="Text deleted by over-writing">l</span><span class="add  overtext" title="Addition written over existing text">{t}</span>ling</span> - If we get
<br/>free navigation of the <span class="">Zambesi</span> at which 
<br/>I have been striving for years everthing
<br/>else will follow - <span class="">M<span class="sup ">s</span> Stewart</span> has been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>up at <span class="">Tette</span> - the mission - the top of the
<br/>cataracts &amp; now sees home - Five Scotchmen
<br/>2 carpenters - 2 masons - 1 smith &amp; a
<br/>leader - a missionary are to join us - 
<br/>They worked at their trades at <span class="">Ahwal North</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>bought 2 waggons to go overland when the
<br/>Governor wrote to me and I have pro-

<br/>I tried Gum trees at the grave but they
