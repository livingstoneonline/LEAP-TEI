<br/><p class="p noindent">Transmitted by Captain WASHINGTON, R.N., F.R.S., Hydrographer 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="space" title="space: 6 words ">                                                </span>to the Admiralty.</p>

<br/>
<br/><p class="p ">IN the typical cases given in Dr. <span class="">M'William's</span><span class="">"Medical 
His-<br/>tory of the Niger Expedition"</span>, the gall-bladder was found 
dis-<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>tended with black bile; and, if my memory does not deceive 
<br/>me, most of the cases treated with quinine at an early period 
<br/>of the disease either recovered, or were subjected to the milder 
<br/>or <span class="">intermittent form of fever</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In 1850 I adopted the plan of giving quinine mixed with a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>purgative as the first step of the treatment, and was successful 
<br/>in the cases of two of my own children and an English party 
<br/>whom we found at Lake Ngami, and of whom one had died 
<br/>before our arrival. I have lost the notes of my reasons for 
<br/>adopting the practice, but I have been successful in every case 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I have met with since. The prescription employed is --Resin 
<br/>of <span class="">jalap</span>, and <span class="">calomel</span>, of each eight grains; quinine and 
<br/>rhubarb, of each four grains; mix well together, and when 
<br/>required make into pills with spirit of cardamoms: dose from 
<br/>then to twenty grains.<span class="sup ">*</span> The violent headache, pains in the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>back, etc., are all relieved in from four to six hours; and with 
<br/>the operation of the medicine there is an enormous discharge
<br/>of black bile, -- the patient frequently calls it blood. If the 
<br/>operation is delayed, a dessert-spoonful of salts promotes the 
<br/>action. Quinine is then given till the ears ring, etc. We have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>tried to substitute other purgatives instead of the resin, <span class="">jalap</span>, 
<br/>and <span class="">calomel</span>, but our experiments have only produced the 
con-<br/>viction that aught else is mere trifling. No strength is lost in 
<br/>our march up the river of six hundred miles on foot. A 
<br/>European would be stricken down one day, and the next, after 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the operation of the remedy, would resume his march on foot. 
<br/>In some very severe attacks it was necessary for the patient to 
<br/>travel upon a donkey, but after two or three days he would 
<br/>prefer to tramp it.</p>
<br/><span class="note editorial  true">[* Since the paper was read, Dr. McWilliam has received through <br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>the Foreign Office the following amended formula of <br/>Dr. Livingstone's prescription--viz.: "Take of resin, of jalap, and <br/>of rhubarb, six or eight grains; of calomel and quinine four <br/>grains each: mix well in a mortar, and preserve for use." (The rest <br/>is correct.)]</span>

<br/>
<br/><p class="p ">We tried <span class="">Warburg's tincture</span>, which has a great reputation 
<br/>in India, but it causes profuse sweating, and does not cure the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>disease; the strength is also impaired. We had a good supply, 
<br/>by the kindness of one of our nobility, but I am compelled to 
<br/>say that it did not answer our expectations. The daily use of 
<br/>quinine is no preventive. We have seen many cases occur 
<br/>when the person was on the verge of cinchonism.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">I employed the foregoing remedy with success on the west 
<br/>coast, but made no fuss about it more than make a general 
<br/>statement in the "Missionary Travels." I was not quite sure 
<br/>that our fever was identical with that Dr. <span class="">M'William</span>encoun-<br/>tered in the Niger, but the melancholy fate of a party of 
mis-<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>sionaries at Linyanti, where six out of nine Europeans and 
<br/>four native attendants perished in the space of three months, 
<br/>makes me fear that it is the same complaint as that which 
<br/>destroyed the officers of Commodore Owen in the Zambesi, 
<br/>those of Captain Tuckey in the Congo, and the crews of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Great Niger Expedition in that river. My companions, Dr. 
<br/>Kirk and Mr. C. Livingstone, entertain the same opinion of the 
<br/>value of our pills as I do. We wrote a <span class="">paper for one of the 
<br/>medical journals</span>. But the above sad case makes us anxious 
<br/>that the remedy should become more extensively known than 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>it has been, and I do not know a better plan for effecting this 
<br/>than by communicating it to Dr. <span class="">M'William</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Those who may try the remedy will do well to remember 
<br/>that the above does are for strong adults.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I cured myself and native companions in this way during 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>my long journeys between 1852 and 1856, and that the 
<br/>remedy has no bad effect on the system may be inferred from 
<br/>the fact that I have had no regular attack of fever since my 
<br/>return. I have had little illness, probably from exposure to 
<br/><span class="">malaria</span> in its most intense forms, but nothing like what I 
for-<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>merly experienced; and I am of opinion that, what we were 
<br/>all taught, not to give quinine till we had used the preliminary 
<br/>measure of relieving the bowels was a mistake.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Query--Might not the remedy be applied to some of the 
<br/>fevers at home that arise in unhealthy localities? Around 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>every village in this country there is a very large collection of 
<br/>human ordure during the dry season; this is swept into the 
<br/>rivers by the heavy rains, and you may guess the effect from 
<br/>hundred of thousands of villages. The natives here do not 
<br/>drink it, as the natives do on the banks of the Thames, but 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>make holes in the sand to draw from. Possibly this has as 
<br/>much to do with the origin of fever as it has at home.</p>

<br/><p class="p ">Dr. <span class=""><span class="smallcaps ">M'William</span></span> observed that anything coming from Dr. 
<br/>Livingstone was sure to command attention and interest, and 
<br/>that he therefore had had great satisfaction in bringing his 
<br/>brief communication before the society. He (Dr. <span class="">M'William</span>) 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>had not been in any of the rivers on the east coast; but he had 
<br/>treated fever off the coast of Mozambique, and at Madagascar, 
<br/>which he found of a much more tractable nature than that 
<br/>which he had encountered on the west coast, more especially 
<br/>in the Niger. But from what he had learned of the traders at 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Mozambique, he feared that the rivers on the east coast were 
<br/>not much less inimical to European life than those of the west 
<br/>coast. The Zambesi was about twenty-five degrees south of 
<br/>the Niger; but there seemed to be no defect of heat-- that 
<br/>important element in the causation of fever--in the Zambesi, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>according to the day's meteorological observations which Dr. 
<br/>Livingstone had appended to his paper. The difference 
<br/>between the temperature of the dry and wet bulb thermometers 
<br/>was far beyond anything met with in the Niger, and was 
<br/>indicative of the unwonted dryness of the atmosphere in the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>Zambesi. With regard to the treatment so successfully 
em-<br/>ployed by Dr. Livingstone, the principle was of course not 
<br/>new, although he was not aware that the precise formula of 
<br/>that eminent traveller had hitherto been used; and as other 
<br/>purgatives than <span class="">jalap</span>, <span class="">calomel</span>, and rhubarb, in combination 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>with quinine, had failed in Dr. Livingstone's hands, it was 
<br/>desirable that the prescription he recommended should have 
<br/>further trial. To this end, he (Dr <span class="">M'William</span>) would 
<br/>endeavour to give it all possible publicity. Dr. Livingstone 
<br/>had alluded to the mortality in other African expeditions, and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>it might not be uninteresting to the society that he (Dr. 
<br/><span class="">M'William</span>) should briefly recapitulate the losses sustained in 
<br/>the expedition to the Congo in 1816; to the Zambesi, from 
<br/>Captain Owen's ship, in 1823; to the Niger, under Laird,</p>

<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><p class="p ">The <span class="italic ">Pleiad's</span> complement comprised--twelve whites and

<br/><p class="p ">She remained in the river five months, employed in

<br/>had attacks of fever while in the river, which, in some cases, 
<br/>returned in the form of <span class="">intermittent</span>, months after they had 
<br/>left it. There were also some scorbutic cases, but all came out 
<br/>of the river alive. Dr. Baikie attributed the comparative

<br/>which, in accordance with his instructions drawn up by Dr.

<br/>by saying that, however unwilling he was to say a single word 
<br/>unfavourable to quinine as a preventive of fever, truth 
com-<br/>pelled him to state that, in this respect, it had not maintained 
<br/>its reputation in the hands of Dr. Livingstone-- a circumstance

<br/><p class="p ">But these heavy rates of mortality are surpassed by what 
<br/>took place at the Gambia in 1825, where a detachment of one 
<br/>hundred and eight men (whites) arrived at the end of May, 
<br/>just as the rainy season commenced. Of this number there 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>remained alive on the 21st of September of the same year, 
<br/>twenty-one, the mortality having been within the space of four 
<br/>months 82<span class="sup ">.</span>85 per cent.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Another detachment of ninety-one men, which in the 
mean-<br/>time had been on board of a transport at the anchorage, and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>which while there did not lose a man, was landed about the 
<br/>end of September, and made up the force to one hundred and 
<br/>twelve. Of this number, there had perished of fever, sixty- 
<br/>one; and of other diseases, includeding six from fever following 
<br/>punishment, twelve; total, seventy-three, or at the rate of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>65<span class="sup ">.</span>17 per cent. during less than three months.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">During this fearful mortality, a detachment of from forty to 
<br/>fifty black soldiers of the 2nd West India Regiment lost only 
<br/>one man, and had seldom any in hospital.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">To go back still further. Mungo Park, on his second journey 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to the interior of Africa, left the Gambia on the 28th of April, 
<br/>1805, having with him, besides his brother-in-law--Mr. 
An-<br/>derson, Mr. Scott, and Lieut. Martin, thirty-four soldiers, four 
<br/>carpenters, and two seamen--in all forty-four Europeans. He 
<br/>did not reach the Niger at Bambakoo until the 19th of August, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>far into the rainy season, having had to traverse five hundred 
<br/>miles of country fertile of disease, and beset with danger. 
<br/>Dysentery and fever had by this time made sad havoc amongst 
<br/>his people, for there remained alive only eleven of the whole, 
<br/>and on the 11th of October all, save four, were dead. Whether 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>any white, except Lieut. Martin, survived to perish with him 
<br/>under the rocks at Boussa some time in November, has not 
<br/>been ascertained. Park himself had severe dysentery, which 
<br/>he considered he cured himself of with mercury pushed to 
<br/>salivation.</p>
