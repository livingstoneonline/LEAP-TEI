<br/><p class="p ">I think I had
<br/>acknowledged the
<br/>receipt of your
<br/>favour containing
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the note from
<br/><span class="">Lady Chetwynd</span> before
<br/>your last came
<br/>to hand but certainly
<br/>not before it was
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>due - and while

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>thanking you for
<br/>the courtesy you
<br/>showed in directing
<br/>me to send my
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>things to your <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: brother's">brothers</span>
<br/>warehouse it has
<br/>occurred to me
<br/>that possibly he
<br/>has some of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>articles we need
<br/>as presents and
<br/>that if we got
<br/>them from him
<br/>it would save all
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the carriage

<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">has</span> he <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">leads and brainsoire</span>
<br/>&amp; ammunition such as
<br/>are used in the West 
<br/>African trade, if so
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I would like to arrange
<br/>with him - <span class="add  above">or another</span> on getting 
<br/>samples - I am
<br/>proceeding on the
<br/>hope of being excused
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>if I am thinking
<br/>of him too meanly
<br/>and that if he is
<br/>not actually engaged
<br/>in interpreting <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">beads</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>he may give me a
<br/>hint as to finding
<br/>a man who will
<br/>deal fairly with me
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>instead. I could get
<br/>them in <span class="">London</span> but
<br/>the carriage might
<br/>be saved by getting
<br/>them in <span class="">Liverpool</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Hoping you will not
<br/>imitate my bad
<br/>example in correspondence</p>
