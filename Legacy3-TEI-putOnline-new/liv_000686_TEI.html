<br/> 
<br/><span class="">The Rev<span class="sup underline ">d</span> J. J. Freeman</span>
<br/><span class="opener-salute">My Dear Sir,</span></span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 6 words ">                                                </span>We have indulged
<br/>the hope for several months past that you would
<br/>find it convenient to visit us, but having
<br/>lately heard from <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> that you seemed
<br/>inclined to make <span class="">Kuruman</span> your farthest
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>point North. I now take the liberty of entreating
<br/>you to reconsider your resolution. I hope
<br/>our <span class=""><span class="">Kuruman</span> friends</span> will press on your
<br/>attention the superior claims of the stations 
<br/>in this quarter to those of the <span class="">French bretheren</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>by which you propose to return. But before
<br/>I urge any other consideration I may mention
<br/>that before undertaking my late journey I 
<br/>expected to return in time to meet you at 
<br/>the <span class="">Kuruman</span> before the departure of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> L.</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>my journey was much longer than I expected
<br/>and <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> L.</span> wanted 2 months here along -
<br/>I have been eight months from home
<br/>this year - Two of these were spent in trying
<br/>place <span class="">Paul</span> with the tribe of Mokhatla

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>there is always a great deal of work to be done
<br/>after an absence from a station - our house is yet
<br/>unfinished - But were there no other considerations
<br/>the oxen are altogether unfit to travel - one half
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>have been worked for six months and have
<br/>done &amp; endured more than oxen ever did before 
<br/>The others have all been affected by a disease
<br/>which renders them unable to travel</p>
<br/><p class="p ">For your coming I have to urge - that
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>when you have visited the <span class="">colonial stations</span>
<br/>you have only seen one end of the chain, and 
<br/>as your advice at home will probably vitally
<br/>affect the onward movement of the whole you
<br/>ought for your own satisfaction to see the other end 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>This is the more necessary because the <span class="">Directors</span>
<br/>seem by our expression in the <span class="">Report for <span class="">/47</span></span>
<br/>to have imbibed our erroneous impression
<br/>as to the position a missionary occupies when 
<br/>beginning with a new tribe - It is stated
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>that I had been under the necessity of returning 
<br/>to <span class="">Mabotsa</span> - a step I never dreamed of - for 
<br/>although put to shifts from the beginning
<br/>till now for vegetables &amp; corn, the uniform
<br/>kindness of the people endeared us to them 

<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>and I am fully persuaded that any missionary may
<br/>live in perfect security <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">with any tribe</span> in so far as the natives
<br/>are concerned if he have only a decent smack
<br/>of common sense. So strong is my conviction
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>on this point I do not believe there is any necessity 
<br/>for two <span class="">Europeans</span> to be present with any one tribe 
<br/>and I should consider giving countenance to a colle<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, ">gue</span>
<br/>-gue to settle here as inflicting a wrong on some
<br/>other tribe which might otherwise be enjoying
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>his services - <span class="space" title="space: 3 chars ">      </span>Then again you stated, I think 
<br/>most truly in a speech delivered in <span class="">Cape Town</span> 
<br/>that since the failure of the <span class=""><span class="">Niger</span> expedition</span>
<br/>this must be considered the key to the interior
<br/>Now we have sailed on the southern end
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of a navigable highway to a large tract of
<br/>country - this discovery belongs to <span class="">Missionaries</span>
<br/>Will you not come in &amp; give your advice 
<br/>as to how we are to take advantage of it
<br/>If I incur any expense I have the rod of "<span class="">a
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>vote of disaprobation</span>" in committee over my
<br/>head - and then the world we have beyond
<br/>in the North - (is that to be left to traders
<br/>&amp; <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>) presses hard on the other side
<br/>I do most sincerely wish you may be

<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>induced to come for many reasons but hope
<br/>you will be guided by His counsel who 
<br/>cannot err.</p>
