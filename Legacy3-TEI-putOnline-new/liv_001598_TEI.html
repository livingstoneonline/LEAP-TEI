<br/><p class="p noindent">Dear <span class="">Captain Washington</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>On treating myself to a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>reperusal of your kind notes I find that 
<br/>I have to give you some information 
<br/>about the country south of the <span class="">Zambesi</span>
<br/>Speaking in a general way all the region 
<br/>south of <span class="">Tette</span><span class="">Senna</span> &amp; <span class="">Shupanga</span> is under 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>true caffre or Zulu rule. the paramount 
<br/>chief <span class="">Manikuse</span>, lately deceased, lived 
<br/>somewhere inland from <span class="">Sofala</span> and 
<br/>he had war with the people of that fort 
<br/>lately. These caffres named Landeens 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>by the Portuguese are quite friendly to 
<br/>the English - we meet them occasionally 
<br/>at <span class="">Shupanga</span> where they come to 
<br/>take tribute of the Portuguese whom 
<br/>they conquered. We had thoughts of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>going in that direction and to visit 
<br/>an <span class="add  above">ancient</span> Jesuit establishment at <span class="">Gorongozo</span>
<br/>about 60 miles west of <span class="">Senna</span>, but 
<br/>we have the difficulty that the Portuguese 
<br/>still claim the whole country, and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>any thing we should do would be 
<br/>opening the country which at present 
<br/>they dare not enter, for their advantage: 
<br/>Large sections of a very fine mountainous 
<br/>country called <span class="">Shiringoma</span> were ceded 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>by the natives to Portuguese who had 
<br/>intermarried with their chiefs - they were 
<br/>expelled by the Zulus aforementioned, 
<br/>and now that they dare not set a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>foot in it their home Government 
<br/>made a decree that the lands were to be 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: notext">be</span> more equally divided, and the family 
<br/>that got it by intermarriage should 
<br/>only have seven leagues of it - they 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>fled lately from <span class="">Shupanga</span> even 
<br/>because the rent was excessive, 
<br/>400 dollars to their own Government, 
<br/>&amp; 600 to the Zulus.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Then whenever we go the Portuguese 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>try to pick up information in a 
<br/>sneaking way, and assert that they 
<br/>knew all about it long ago. "It is 
<br/>all in our archives in Lisbon"
<br/>It is not the low characters out here 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>that do so but Portuguese ministers 
<br/>even, as in the case of two slaves 
<br/>having come from <span class="">Cassange</span>
<br/>in Angola to <span class="">Tette</span>. they said in 
<br/>a dispatch to our Government that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>these were Portuguese who "went to 
<br/>Mosambique." there is an old woman 
<br/>still living at <span class="">Tette</span> who remembers 
<br/>their coming, and she is positive that 
<br/>they were quite black, and did not 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span> 
<br/>go further than <span class="">Tette</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">They claim <span class="">Delgoa Bay</span> too and all 
<br/>the sea board - so we should procure no 
<br/>advantage for our own country by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>opening up friendly relations with 
<br/>the tribes inland of their claims. We 
<br/>feel more interest in parts beyond 
<br/>their claims - and the <span class="">Rovuma</span> is 
<br/>said to be navigated in large 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>canoes as far at least as the 
<br/>Longitude of the <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>Between <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> and 
<br/>the Banyai there is a large 
<br/>friendly tribe called Bazizulus
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>(Portuguese Mosusurus) they have 
<br/>cattle and are in an interesting gold 
<br/>country - stone walls &amp; <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">caves</span>
<br/>are said to be common. We 
<br/>shall make a trip to them in our 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>way up after we have been to the 
<br/><span class="">Rovuma</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Many thanks for the ale &amp; 
<br/>books. We have a good chronometer 
<br/>belonging to the Government and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>my own private one as a standard
<br/>We have a third but it is small

<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>In the typical cases given

<br/>me most of the cases treated with quinine 
<br/>at an early period of the disease either 
<br/>recovered or were subjected to the 
<br/>milder or intermittent form of Fever.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><p class="p noindent">In 1850 I adopted the plan of giving 
<br/>quinine mixed with a purgative as 
<br/>the first step of the treatment - and was 
<br/>successful in the cases of two of my 
<br/>own children and an English party whom 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>we found at <span class="">Lake Ngami</span>, and of whom 
<br/>one had died before our arrival - I have 
<br/>lost the notes of my reasons for 
<br/>adopting the practice, but I have been 
<br/>successful in every case I have met 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>with since. The prescription employed 
<br/>is of Resin of Jalap and Calomel <span class="add  above">of each</span> eight 
<br/>grains - Quinine and <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">and</span> Rhubarb 
<br/>of each four grains. Mix well together 
<br/>and when required make into pills 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>with Spirit of Cardamoms. Dose from 
<br/>Ten to Twenty grains. The violent 
<br/>headache - pains in the back &amp;c &amp;c are all 
<br/>relieved in from four to six hours </p>

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span> 

<br/><p class="p noindent">the greatest difference to <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> MacWilliam</span> observed was I believe 16º generally it was 6º or 7º </p><br/>
<br/><p class="p noindent">and with the operation of the medicine there is 
<br/>an enormous discharge of black bile - the 
<br/>patient frequently calls it blood. If the operation 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>is delayed a dessert spoonful of salts promotes 
<br/>the action. Quinine is then given till the 
<br/>ears ring &amp;c. We have tried to substitute 
<br/>other purgatives instead of the Resin of Jalap 
<br/>and Calomel but our experiments have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>only produced the conviction that aught else 
<br/>is mere trifling. No strength is lost. 
<br/>In our march up the river of 600 miles 
<br/>on foot - a European would be stricken 
<br/>down one day and the next after the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>operation of the remedy would resume 
<br/>his march on foot. In some very 
<br/>severe attacks a donkey was used but 
<br/>never more than two days - he would 
<br/>prefer to tramp it.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>We tried Warburg's Tincture 
<br/>which has a great reputation in 
<br/>India, but it causes profuse sweating 
<br/>and does not cure the disease - 
<br/>the strength is also impaired. We 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>had a good supply, by the kindness 
<br/>of one of our Nobility, but I am 
<br/>compelled to say that it did not 
<br/>answer our expectations. the daily 
<br/>use of Quinine is no preventative 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>we have seen many cases occur 
<br/>when the person was on the verge of 
<br/>cinchonism.</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/><p class="p ">I employed the foregoing remedy with success 
<br/>on the west coast, but made no fuss about 
<br/>it more than make a general statement 
<br/>in the "Missionary Travels." I was not quite 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>sure that our fever was identical with 
<br/>that <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> MacWilliam</span> encountered in the 
<br/><span class="">Niger</span> but the melancholy fate of a party 
<br/>of missionaries at <span class="">Linyanti</span> where six 
<br/>out of nine Europeans, and four native 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>attendants perished in the short space of three 
<br/>months makes me fear that it is the same 
<br/>complaint as that which destroyed the officers 
<br/>of <span class="">Commodore Owen</span> in <span class="">Zambesi</span> - those 
<br/>of <span class="">Captain Tuckey</span> in the <span class="">Congo</span>, and the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>crews of the Great Niger Expedition in 
<br/>that River. My companions, <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span>
<br/>and <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> C. Livingstone</span> entertain the same 
<br/>opinion of the value of our Pills that I do. 
<br/>We wrote a paper for one of the medical 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>journals. But the above sad case 
<br/>makes us anxious that the remedy 
<br/>should become more extensively known 
<br/>than it has been - and I do not know 
<br/>a better plan for effecting this than 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>by communicating it to <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> MacWilliam</span>. 
<br/>No secret has ever been made of it 
<br/>but I felt as if saying more than 
<br/>I did would be <span class="underline ">Quackish</span> - those 
<br/>who may try it will do well to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>remember that the above doses are 
<br/>for great He creatures whom <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: deletion">[      ]</span> <span class="add  above">they</span> turn 
<br/>so effectually inside out that 

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span> 
<br/>we have termed them "Rousers". </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I cured myself and native companions 
<br/>in this way during my long journeys between 
<br/>1852 and 1856 and that the remedy has 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>no bad effect on the system may be 
<br/>inferred from the fact that I have had 
<br/>no regular attack of fever since my 
<br/>return. I have had little illnesses 
<br/>probably from exposure to malaria 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>in its most intense forms, but nothing 
<br/>like what I formerly experienced. And 
<br/>I am of the opinion that, what we were 
<br/>all taught, not to give quinine 
<br/>till we had used the preliminary measure 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of relieving the bowels, was a 
<br/>mistake Query. Might the <span class="add  above">remedy</span> not be applied 
<br/>to some of the fevers at home that 
<br/>arise in unhealthy localities. Around 
<br/>every village in this country, there is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a very large collection of human ordure 
<br/>during the dry season - this is swept 
<br/>into the rivers by the heavy rains &amp; you 
<br/>may guess the effect from hundreds of 
<br/>Thousands of villages. The natives here 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>dont drink it, as the natives do on the 
<br/>banks of the Thames, but make holes in 
<br/>the sand to draw from. Possibly this 
<br/>has as much to do with the origin of fever as 
<br/>it has at home. - <span class="space" title="space: 1 chars ">  </span>David Livingstone</p>
