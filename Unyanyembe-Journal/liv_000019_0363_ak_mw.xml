<lb/>on enquiring of men who have seen

<lb/>the doorways are level with the country

<lb/><persName>Muhamad</persName> called me this <date when="1868-02-25">morning</date> to apologize

<lb/>no harm is done. The <term type="tribe">Wanyamwesi</term> kill for all

<lb/><p>I asked <persName>Muhamad</persName> today if it were true that

<lb/>he was a prisoner at <placeName><settlement type="village"></settlement><persName>Casembe</persName></placeName> he replied "quite

<lb/>so" some <orgName><term type="tribe">Garapanza</term> people</orgName> now at <placeName><settlement 
type="village">Katanga</settlement></placeName>

<lb/>fought with <persName>Casembe</persName> and <persName>Muhamad</persName> was suspected

<lb/>of being connected with them - <persName>Casembe</persName> attacked

<lb/><orgName>his people</orgName> and during the turmoil a hundred

<lb/>frasilahs of copper were stolen from him and

<lb/>many of <orgName>his people</orgName> killed. <persName>Casembe</persName> kept him

<lb/>a prisoner till sixty of his people were either killed

<lb/>or died - among these <persName>Muhamad's</persName> eldest son.

<lb/>He was thus reduced to poverty - He gave something

<lb/>to <persName>Casembe</persName> to allow him to depart, and I suspect

<lb/>that my <term type="occupation">Sultan</term>'s letter had considerable influence

<lb/>in inducing <persName>Casembe</persName> to accede to his request,

<lb/>for he repeated again and again in my hearing,

<lb/>that he must pay respect to my letter, and 

<lb/>see me safe at least as far as <placeName><settlement type="village">Ujiji</settlement></placeName>. He

<lb/>says that he will not return to <placeName><settlement type="village"><persName>Casembe</persName></settlement></placeName> again.

<lb/>He will begin to trade with some other <term type="occupation">chief</term>

<lb/>It is rather hard for a man at his age to 

<lb/>begin <hi rend="underline"><foreign xml:id="la">de novo</foreign></hi>. He is respected among the

<lb/><orgName>Arabs</orgName> who pronounce him to be a good

<lb/>man. He says that he has been twenty two

<lb/>like that of <date when="1862-02-24">yesterday</date> among the <term type="tribe">Wanyamwesi</term>

<lb/>It is however common for the people

and then

<lb/>have a general row in the <choice><sic>bazar</sic><corr>bazaar</corr></choice> - but no

<lb/>If a child cuts the upper front teeth before

<lb/>to be killed for this, but few would have the

<lb/>child is seen to <sic>to</sic> turn from one side to the

<lb/>other in sleep it is killed - They say of any

<lb/>defects "he is an <orgName>Arab child</orgName>" because the

<lb/><orgName>Arabs</orgName> have none of this class of superstitions

<lb/>and should any <orgName>Arab</orgName> be near they give the

<lb/>followers</orgName> - <persName>Muhamad</persName> says that these children must

<lb/><p>If <persName>Casembe</persName> dreams of any man twice

<lb/><p><persName>Muhamad's</persName> friends advised him to leave

<lb/>was the first to open this country to trade

<lb/>with the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> and all his expenses while

<lb/>seems to be a man of peace and unwilling

<lb/>poisoned his predescessor - He killed his

<lb/>the Lake <!--geogName: Lake Bemba--> has a sandy not muddy bottom

<lb/>as we were at first informed - there are

<lb/>four islands in it - One the <placeName><geogName type="island">Bangweolo</geogName></placeName> is

<lb/>very large and many people live on it. They

<lb/>have <term type="animal">goats</term> and <term type="animal">sheep</term> in abundance - the

<lb/>owners of canoes demand three hoes for the

<lb/>hire of one capable of carrying eight or ten

<lb/>persons - Beyond this island <!--geogName: Bangweolo--> it is sea

<lb/>horizon only - the <term type="tribe">Tsebula</term> &amp; <term type="tribe">Nzoe</term> abound

<lb/>people desire <term type="foodstuff">salt</term> and not beads for sale.</p>

<lb/>the people on the East side of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Loanda</geogName></placeName> are

<lb/>I hope that the most High may give me a

<lb/><p>The <placeName><geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName></placeName> goes North or North West

<lb/>till it meets the <placeName><geogName type="river">Lufira</geogName></placeName> which comes from

<lb/><placeName><geogName type="village">Katanga</geogName></placeName> in the South West. After joining, the

<lb/>into <placeName><geogName type="lake">Chowambe</geogName></placeName> - but no one has gone down.

<lb/>If it actually does go into <placeName><geogName type="lake">Chowambe</geogName></placeName>, then

<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="river">Chambeze</geogName></placeName> and the streams which fall

<lb/>would also be springs of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName> rising

<lb/>Had a long oration from <persName>Muhamad</persName> <date when="1868-04-10">yesterday</date>

<lb/>against going off for <placeName><geogName type="lake">Bemba</geogName></placeName> <date 
when="1868-04-12">tomorrow</date> - 

<lb/>His great argument is the extortionate way

<lb/>of <persName>Casembe</persName> who would demand cloth and

<lb/>say that in pretending to go to <placeName><geogName type="village">Ujiji</geogName></placeName> I had told

<lb/>him lies. He adds to this argument that

<lb/>this is the <seg type="weather">last mouth of the rains</seg> - <seg type="weather">Masika

<lb/>has begun</seg> and our way North will soon

<lb/>be open. The fact of the matter is that

<lb/><persName>Muhamad</persName> by not telling me of the <unclear>superabund</unclear> an

<lb/>of beater in the country of the <term type="tribe">Marungu</term>

<lb/>which occurs every year caused me to 

<lb/>lose five months. He knew that we

<lb/>should be detained here, but he was so eager

<lb/>to get out of his state of durance with

<lb/><persName>Casembe</persName> that he hastened my departure

<lb/>by asserting that we should be at <placeName><geogName type="village">Ujiji</geogName></placeName>

<lb/>in <measure>one month</measure>! I regret this deception

<lb/>but it is not to be wondered at and in a 

<lb/><term type="faith">Muhamadan</term> and in a <term type="faith">Christian</term> too it is

<lb/>thought clever - Were my goods not

<lb/>nearly done I would go &amp; risk the displeasure

<lb/>of <persName>Casembe</persName> for the chance of discovering

<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Bemba</geogName></placeName>, I thought once of

<lb/>buying from <persName>Muhamad Bogarib</persName> but

<lb/>fear that his stock may be getting low

<lb/><p>On preparing to start this morning people refuse to 

<lb/>go <persName>Susi</persName> for no confessed reason but he has got a

<lb/>black woman who feeds him - <persName>Chuma</persName> for the same

<lb/>reason but he pretends fear of <persName>Cazembe</persName>. came with his

<lb/>eyes shot out by <term type="plant"><hi rend="underline">Bange</hi></term> and insisted on telling me what

<lb/><persName>Cazembe</persName> said and did at an interview where I was present

<lb/>and he not - "<persName>Cazembe</persName> would kill us." This to me to others

<lb/>"he could not leave <persName>Susi</persName>" - and I had "cut his pay at

<lb/><placeName><geogName type="city">Bombay</geogName></placeName>" - The only work I know of at 
<placeName><geogName type="city">Bombay</geogName></placeName> was

<lb/>going to school and it never occurred to me to pay for that

<lb/><persName>Susi</persName> had made some statement equally false, and

<lb/><persName>Abraham</persName> had brought up some old grievance as a

<lb/>justification for his absconding - <persName>James</persName> said "he would

<lb/>"go to <placeName><geogName type="village">Ujiji</geogName></placeName> but not backwards - "He was tired of 
working"

<lb/><persName>Abraham</persName> <choice><sic>apologozed</sic><corr>apologized</corr></choice> and was forgiven - 
<persName>Susi</persName> stood like a

<lb/><term type="animal">mule</term>. I put my hand on his arm &amp; said "take up your

<lb/>bundle &amp; let us go." he seized my hand &amp; refused to let it

<lb/>go. When he did I fired a pistol at him but missed -

<lb/>there being no law nor <term type="occupation">magistrate</term> higher than myself

<lb/>I would not be thwarted if I could help it - The fact is

<lb/>they are all tired and <persName>Muhamad</persName>'s opposition encourages

<lb/>them to give themselves over to <term type="plant">Bange</term>and black concubing

<lb/>they would like me to remain here &amp; pay them for

<lb/>smoking the <term type="plant"><hi rend="underline">bange</hi></term>;  and deck their prostitutes with the

<lb/>beads which I give regularly for their food - <persName>Muhamad</persName>

<lb/>who was evidently eager to make capital out of this

<lb/>refusal asked me to remain over today - and then

<lb/>asked me what I was going to do with those who had

<lb/>absconded- I said "nothing" - "if a <term type="occupation">magistrate</term> were

<lb/>on the spot I would give them over to him" - Oh he

<lb/>was <term type="occupation">magistrate</term> - <supplied>"</supplied>shall I apprehend them" to this I

<lb/>assented - He repeated this question till it was

<lb/>tiresome - I saw his reason long afterwards when 

<lb/>he asserted that I "came to him &amp; asked him to

<lb/>bind them but he had refused." He wanted to

<lb/>appear to the people as much better than I am</p>

<lb/>my notebook after returning from <placeName><geogName type="island">Bangweolo</geogName></placeName>

<lb/>in <date when="1868-10">October</date> I may add that <persName>Amoda</persName> wished to

<lb/>to me from <placeName><settlement type="village">Ujiji</settlement></placeName> to supplant the runaway

<lb/>I did not blame them very severely in my own

<lb/>mind for absconding - they were tired of

<lb/>tramping and so verily am I - but <persName><foreign xml:lang="und">Mpamari</foreign></persName>

<lb/>in encouraging them to escape to him and talking

<lb/>with a double tongue cannot be exomerated

<lb/>from blame - Little else can be expected from him

<lb/>He has lived some 35 years in the country - 25 being

<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="village"><persName>Cazembe</persName></settlement></placeName> and there he had often to live by his wits

<lb/>consciousness of my own defects makes me lament.</p>
