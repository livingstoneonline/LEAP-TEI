<lb/>Here the water oozing forth from the surface of the

<lb/><bibl>a letter</bibl> the contents of which neither <persName>Mpamari</persName> nor
<lb/><persName>Muhamad</persName> cares to reveal - some think with great
<lb/>probability that, he asks why did you begin a war
<lb/>if you wanted to leave so soon. Did you not know
<lb/>that the <orgName>country people</orgName> would take advantage of your
<lb/>march encumbered as you will be by women &amp; <orgName>slaves</orgName>.
<lb/><persName>Muhamad Bogharib</persName> called me to ask what advice I
<lb/>could give him as all <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">his own</add> advice <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">and devices too</add> had been lost or were
<lb/>useless, and he did not know what to do - the <term type="tribe">Banyamwezi</term>
<lb/>threatened to go off by night and leave him - they are
<lb/>incensed by the <term type="tribe">Babemba</term>, and are offended because
<lb/>the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> do not aid them in wreaking their vengeance
<lb/>upon them - I took care not to give any advice, but 
<lb/>said if I had been or was in his place I would have sent
<lb/>or would send back <persName>Bin Juma</persName>'s <orgName>captives</orgName> to <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice>
<lb/>that he disapproved of his act - the first in the war =
<lb/>and was willing to make peace with <persName><unclear cert="low">Chapi</unclear></persName>. He said that
<lb/>he did not know that <persName>Bin Juma</persName> would capture these
<lb/>people. That <persName>Bin Juma</persName> had met some <orgName>natives</orgName> with <term type="animal">fish</term>
<lb/>and took ten by force. The <orgName>natives</orgName> in revenge caught three
<lb/><term type="tribe">Banyamwezi</term> <orgName>slaves</orgName>, and <persName>bin Juma</persName> then gave one
<lb/><orgName>slave</orgName> to them as a fine - But <persName>Muhamad</persName> did not
<lb/>know of this affair either. I am of opinion that he
<lb/>knew of both matters, and <persName>Mpamari</persName>'s caracoling,
<lb/><choice><orig>shewed</orig><corr>showed</corr></choice> that he knew it all, though now he denies it.
<lb/><persName>Bin Juma</persName> is a long thin lanky <orgName><choice><orig>Swaheli</orig><reg>Swahili</reg></choice></orgName> six feet two high - 
<lb/>with a hooked nose and large lips - I told <persName>Muhamad</persName>
<lb/>that if he were to go with us to <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Manyema</term></region></placeName> <orgName>the whole party</orgName>
<lb/>would be cut off - He came here - bought a <orgName>slave</orgName> boy &amp;
<lb/>allowed him to escape - then brow beat <persName>Chapi</persName>'s man
<lb/>about him &amp; he says three others - caught ten in lieu
<lb/>of them and <persName>Muhamad</persName> restored six. This was the origin 
<lb/>of the war. Now that we are in the middle of it
<lb/>I must do as <persName>Muhamad</persName> does in going off either 
<lb/>by day or by night - It is unreasonable to ask
<lb/>my advice now, but it is felt that they have very
