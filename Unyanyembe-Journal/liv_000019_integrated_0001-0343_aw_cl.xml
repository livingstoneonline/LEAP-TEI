<lb/>He had quarreled with every one here. When

<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>I find it quite impossible to transmit
<lb/>any letters to the <placeName><region>Sea Coast</region></placeName>- I have nearly met seven
<lb/><term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName> traders</term> on their way from this district to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kilwa</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>but all, save one, took to their heels as soon as they
<lb/>heard that the <term type="nationality">English</term> were coming, and scoured
<lb/>across the country in the pathless forests - The
<lb/>man we met was just on the point of entering a
<lb/>tract of very fine well watered country, which took us
<lb/><measure>eight days hard marching</measure> to cross - We were nearly
<lb/>famished - In the last two days I had made forced
<lb/>marches in order to buy food and send it back to the
<lb/>men, most of whom were unable to keep up with
<lb/>four who bore me company, and this <orgName>Arab</orgName>
<lb/>met &amp; presented an <term type="animal">ox</term> &amp; bag of <term type="foodstuff">flour</term> - He could not
<lb/>wait till I had written - I guessed the number of <orgName>slaves</orgName>
<lb/>he had at eight hundred - the number of under <orgName><term type="occupation">traders</term></orgName>
<lb/>seemed between forty &amp; fifty - The other caravans did
<lb/>not give me a chance of estimating their numbers -
<lb/>The depopulated country was about <measure>one hundred
<lb/>miles broad</measure> and so broad there was no possibility
<lb/>of going round either end - It bore all the marks
<lb/>of having been densely peopled at some former
<lb/>period - The ridges on which the <orgName>natives</orgName> plant
<lb/><term type="plant_foodstuff">grain</term> and <term type="plant_foodstuff">beans</term> were everywhere visible, and
<lb/>from the numbers of calcined clay pipes -
<lb/>used in furnaces - it is evident that they
<lb/>worked extensively in iron - The country was
<lb/>very beautiful - mountainous - well wooded
<lb/>and watered - I counted in <measure>one <choice><sic>days</sic><corr>day's</corr></choice> march</measure>
<lb/>fifteen running burns though it was the dry
<lb/>season, and some were from <measure><measure>four</measure> to <measure>ten

<lb/>The elevation being between <measure><measure>2000</measure> &amp; <measure>3000 feet
<lb/>above the sea</measure></measure> -</p>
<lb/><p>The process of depopulation to which I have
<lb/>adverted in the first part of this <bibl>Despatch</bibl> goes on
<lb/>annually - The <orgName><placeName><region>Coast</region></placeName> Arabs</orgName> from <placeName><settlement type="village">Kilwa</settlement></placeName> come
<lb/>with plenty of ammunition and calico to the
<lb/>tribe called <term type="tribe">Waiyau</term> or <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> and say that
<lb/>they want <orgName>slaves</orgName> - Marauding parties immediately
<lb/>start off to the <placeName><settlement type="village">Manganja</settlement></placeName> or <placeName><settlement type="village"><w>Wa<subst><del/><add place="over-text">n</add></subst>yassa</w></settlement></placeName> villages
<lb/>and having plenty of powder &amp; guns overpower
<lb/>and bring back the chief portion of the inhabitants
<lb/>those who escape usually die of starvation -
<lb/>This process is identical with that of which
<lb/>we formerly saw so much in the hands of the
<lb/><term type="people">Portuguese</term> in the <placeName><geogName type="valley">Shire valley</geogName></placeName> - I cannot write
<lb/>about it without a painful apprehension
<lb/>that to persons at a distance I must appear
<lb/>guilty of exaggeration - But I beg your Lordship
<lb/>to remember that whenever my statements
<lb/>have been tested on the sport they have been found
<lb/>within and not beyond the truth - Even the
<lb/>grand <placeName><geogName type="waterfall">Victoria falls</geogName></placeName> were put down at less
<lb/>than half their size - It was ignorance of this
<lb/>gigantic evil, while I was familiar only
<lb/>with the wild industrious tribes of the great
<lb/><placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>, that led me formerly to believe that
<lb/>much might be made of their labour -
<lb/>I still believe in their capabilities, but this
<lb/>useful system that flourishes chiefly within
<lb/><measure>three hundred miles of the <placeName><region>Coast</region></placeName></measure> must be first
<lb/>put down -</p>
<lb/><p>The perpetrators of the great annual
<lb/>mischief would themselves be shocked
<lb/>were the guilt not subdivided - the <term type="occupation"><placeName><settlement type="village">Kilwa</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName> <orgName>slave</orgName> traders</term> do not

<lb/>starvation after a foray, are probably never
<lb/>seen by the marauders after their flight from their
<lb/>villages - Then those who die on their way to the
<lb/><placeName><region>Coast</region></placeName> do so piecemeal - The only victims which
<lb/>might disturb the <orgName>Arab</orgName> conscience are those who
<lb/>are tied to trees and allowed to perish - We saw three
<lb/>adult bodies fastened by the <w>ne<subst><del/><add place="over-text">c</add></subst>k</w> to trees and their

<lb/>people, that the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> when vexed at losing their

<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="chars"/>I took occasion to explain to the different
<lb/><term type="occupation">chiefs</term> that those who sold their people participated
<lb/>in the guilt of the deaths, evidence of which we
<lb/>had seen strewed along the way to the <placeName><region>Coast</region></placeName> - It always
<lb/>caused evident alarm, and especially when it
<lb/>was asserted, that in selling their people they were
<lb/>as guilty before Him who saw the whole from
<lb/>the bargain to the ensuing death, as if they had
<lb/>held the victim while the <orgName>Arab</orgName> cut his throat -
<lb/>Their uneasy excuses were somewhat those of
<lb/>children - "If so &amp; so gives up selling so will we"
<lb/>"He is the greatest offender in the country" "It is the
<lb/>fault of the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> who tempt us with fine clothes

<lb/><p>This alteration cannot fairly be called
