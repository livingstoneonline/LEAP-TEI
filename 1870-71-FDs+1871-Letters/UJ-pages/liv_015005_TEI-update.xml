<lb/>in the large bend which this great Lacustrine

<lb/>Two hours were the utmost I could accomplish

<lb/>would have appeared in the <bibl>Newspaper</bibl>
<lb/>if they had one - "the <orgName>Manyema</orgName> were very

<lb/>The <orgName><term type="occupation">masters</term></orgName> did not quite approve of this,
<lb/>but the deeds had been done - and then
<lb/><orgName><term type="occupation">masters</term></orgName> and men joined in one chorus
<lb/>"the <orgName>Manyema</orgName> are bad, bad, bad, awfully
<lb/>bad, and <orgName>cannibals</orgName>" - In going <placeName><region>West of
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Bambarre</settlement></placeName></region></placeName> in order to embark on the
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName></placeName>, I went down the <placeName><geogName type="river">Luamo</geogName></placeName> - a

<lb/>of their districts - Glad that no collision took
<lb/>place, we returned to <placeName><settlement type="village">Bambarre</settlement></placeName> = and then
<lb/>with our friend <persName>Muhamad</persName> struck away due
<lb/>North = He to buy ivory, and I to reach
<lb/>another part of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName></placeName> and buy a

<lb/><p>The country is extremely beautiful, but <!-- geog: Manyema -->

<lb/>of soil required for the side of the foot, and
<lb/>down he comes into the slough - the path

<lb/><measure>sixty or more yards</measure>, as if he who first

<lb/>from which here as in <placeName><country>Madagascar</country></placeName> grass
<lb/>cloth is woven and called by the same
<lb/>name "<hi rend="underline"><foreign xml:lang="mg">Lamba</foreign></hi>", has taken possession
<lb/>of a valley - the leaf stalks as thick as a

<lb/>all passage save by a path made and
<lb/>mixed up by the feet of <term type="animal">elephants</term> and

<lb/>a species of dark glossy leaved grass with

<lb/>that amount of water rises up on the leg -
<lb/>At every step the foot has to be raised high
<lb/>enough to place it on the unbent mass in
