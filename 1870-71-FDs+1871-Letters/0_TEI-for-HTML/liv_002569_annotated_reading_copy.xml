<lb/>your invitation to lodge with you at <placeName><geogName type="island" ref="geogName.xml#geog0060">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName> but I feel so woefully

<lb/>it is slaking thirst for blood and catching <orgName>free people</orgName> very many of
<lb/>whom die before reaching <placeName><region>the coast</region></placeName> - I shall give you an episode which
<lb/>happened about a fortnight ago close by the spot where I write - My spirits
<lb/>are beyond measure depressed in writing on such matters for the public
<lb/>and I can only give half statements for fear of letting heartless dawdlers
<lb/>drawl from their club sofas "exaggeration" "overdrawing" &amp;c - The
<lb/>restrained exposure of the vile <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> deeds on the <placeName><geogName type="river" ref="geogName.xml#geog0050">Shire</geogName></placeName> in my last
<lb/>book made me oblivious to every thing else - My own &amp; family interests
<lb/>were unheeded - <persName ref="people.xml#pers0142">Lord Palmerston</persName> sent a <term type="occupation"><term type="occupation">Queen</term>'s counsel</term> to ask me "what
<lb/>he could do to aid me as he was most anxious to serve me" I could only think
<lb/>of the work in <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> &amp; asked the <placeName><region>East African</region></placeName> ports to be opened to lawful
<lb/>commerce <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">for all nations</add> - It never occurred to me that he meant aught for myself or
<lb/>children till I was out here and <persName ref="people.xml#pers0142">Lord Palmerston</persName> dead - <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The episode I
<lb/>mention was by <orgName><persName ref="people.xml#pers0002">Muhamad Bogharib</persName>'s people</orgName>, and he being the best man
<lb/>of all who have come to trade in <placeName><region ref="region.xml#region0013">Manyema</region></placeName> you may <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>if you can imagine
<lb/>the conduct of the people of the worst - <persName ref="people.xml#pers0047"><choice><sic>Bon</sic><corr>Bin </corr></choice> Hassani</persName> - <persName ref="people.xml#pers0019"><choice><sic>Bon embegu</sic><corr>Bin Mbegu</corr></choice></persName> &amp;
<lb/><persName ref="people.xml#pers0020">Bin Omar</persName> the heads of the party sent to trade gave the <term type="tribe" ref="ethnic-group.xml#ethnic0010">Manyema</term> near
<lb/><persName ref="people.xml#pers0222">Moene Lualaba</persName> 25 copper <w>b<subst><del>l</del><add place="over-text">r</add></subst>acelets</w> worth at <placeName><settlement type="village" ref="settlement.xml#sett0014">Ujiji</settlement></placeName> about 2 <choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> dollars.
<lb/>This was the trap - Then went down the river &amp; sold all the rest of their copper <!-- geog: Lualaba -->
<lb/>for ivory - coming back they demanded ivory for the 25 rings &amp; began
<lb/>to shoot the men in cold blood, and capture women &amp; children &amp; grass cloth -
<lb/><term type="animal">goats</term> &amp; <term type="animal">fowls</term> - they continued the murdering for three days in a densely peopled
<lb/>district and carried off an immense number of women &amp; children because
<lb/><persName ref="people.xml#pers0002">Muhamad</persName> does not intend to trade here again - With all his goodness I
<lb/>have no doubt but he knew the plan &amp; will <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> his full share of the <orgName>captives</orgName>
<lb/>They will come into <placeName><geogName type="island" ref="geogName.xml#geog0060">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName><!-- I thought we were coding Zanzibar as an island. MW --><!-- Yes, the older practice was region, but new manual is island. HB --> as <term type="occupation">traders</term>, and the people as <orgName><hi rend="underline">bought</hi> slaves</orgName> but there is
<lb/>not one <orgName>slave</orgName> among them and to make the matter the more atrocious the very men
<lb/>who murdered &amp; captured repeatedly declared to me that the people now vicitimized
<lb/>were remarkably civil and kind - <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>thousands come over to the river every <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">market</add> day to hold <!-- geog: Lualaba -->
<lb/>markets at various points for <term type="plant_foodstuff">flour</term> <term type="plant_foodstuff">cassava</term> <term type="plant_foodstuff">beans</term> <term type="plant_foodstuff">groundnuts</term> <term type="foodstuff"><term type="animal">fish</term></term><!-- Do we need an "animal_foodstuff" to go with "plant_foodstuff?"?

<lb/>noticed that when the men of two districts were engaged in actual hostilities the women
<lb/>go from market to market with their wares unmolested - Women were never
<lb/>touched until now by these <orgName><choice><orig>Muhamadans</orig><reg>Muhammadans</reg></choice></orgName> - as a rule not a <orgName>slave</orgName> is sold in
<lb/><placeName><region ref="region.xml#region0013">Manyema</region></placeName> except by the ruffian strangers - It would be only Justice if the
<lb/><term type="occupation">Sultan</term> would set free all <orgName>captives</orgName> from <placeName><region ref="region.xml#region0013">Manyema</region></placeName> as soon as they arrive -
<lb/>They were not traded for but murdered for - In talking with these <orgName ref="orgName.xml#org0027">Ujijians</orgName> I
<lb/>always protest against shedding human blood - they think that rhyming
<lb/>over "God is great" &amp;c all sin is forgiven - a <orgName>slave</orgName> of <persName ref="people.xml#pers0183">Thani bin <unclear cert="medium">Suellim</unclear></persName> of
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village" ref="settlement.xml#sett0014">Ujiji</settlement></placeName> named <persName ref="people.xml#pers0193">Yahood</persName> boasted in my hearing of having with his comrades
<lb/>killed one kindred people &amp; burned 9 villages - all for a single string of red <unclear cert="high">beads</unclear>
<lb/>which a <orgName><placeName><region ref="region.xml#region0013">Manyema</region></placeName> man</orgName> tried in vain to steal - I said to him "you were sent
<lb/>to trade not to murder" He replied "we <hi rend="underline">are</hi> sent to kill people, that is our work"
<lb/>one of my people was killed I suppose in blind revenge - a man was pinned
<lb/>to the ground with a spear near <unclear cert="high">the</unclear> 9 villages and I was sleeping in another
<lb/>close by - three were killed at another village and we <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know who are
<lb/>friends &amp; who have first cause to seek revenge of all strangers - I find great
<lb/>difficulty in getting a canoe after the <persName ref="people.xml#pers0002">Bogharib</persName> feat of arms - all flee from us
<lb/>your men seem as eager for blood as others - all long to be able to brag of blood
