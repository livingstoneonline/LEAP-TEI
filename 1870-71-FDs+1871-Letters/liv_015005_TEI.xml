<lb/>as irritable <term type="ailment">eating ulcers</term> - if the foot were
<lb/>put to the ground a discharge of bloody <foreign xml:lang="grk">ichor</foreign>
<lb/>flowed and the same discharge happened
<lb/>every night with considerable pain that
<lb/>prevented sleep - the wailing of the <orgName>slaves</orgName>
<lb/>is one of the night sounds of a <orgName>slave</orgName> camp
<lb/>they eat through everything muscle tendon
<lb/>bone and often lame permanently if they
<lb/>do not kill the poor things - medicines 
<lb/>have very little effect - their periodicity
<lb/>seems to say that they are allied to <term type="ailment">Fever</term>
<lb/>The <orgName>Arabs</orgName> make a <term type="medicament">salve of <term type="insect">Bees</term> wax and 
<lb/>sulphate of copper</term> and this applied hot
<lb/>and held on by a bandage affords support
<lb/>but the necessity of letting the <foreign xml:lang="grk">ichor</foreign>
<lb/>escapes renders it a painful remedy. 
<lb/>I had <term type="ailment">three ulcers</term> and no medicine the 
<lb/><orgName>native</orgName> plan of support by means of a 
<lb/>stiff leaf or bit of calabash was too irritating 
<lb/>they continued to eat in and enlarge 
<lb/>in spite of everything - the vicinity was

<lb/>I was at last advised to try <term type="medicament">Malachite
<lb/>rubbed down with water on a stone and 
<lb/>applied with a feather</term> - this was the 
<lb/>only thing that had any beneficial effect
<lb/><term type="medicament">Copper rubbed down</term> in the same way is
<lb/>a remedy of good repute but <term type="medicament">malachite</term>
<lb/>alone proved beneficial in my case
<lb/><note place="marginleft"><date when="1870-09-26">26<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></note> I have been able now to report the 
<lb/><term type="ailment">ulcers</term> healing - For eighty days I was 
<lb/>completely laid up by them and it was 
<lb/>long ere the lost substance was replaced
<lb/>they kill many <orgName>slaves</orgName> - and an 
<lb/>epidemic came to us which carried
<lb/><note place="marginleft"><date when="1870-10">October</date></note> off thirty in our small camp - it was

<lb/>epidemic raged here we heard of <term type="ailment">cholera</term> terribly
<lb/>severe on the way to <placeName><region>the coast</region></placeName></p>
<lb/><p>Another disease called <term type="ailment">Safura</term> or earth eating 
<lb/>attacks great numbers of both <orgName>slaves</orgName> &amp; <orgName>freemen</orgName>
<lb/>on seeing it on the <placeName><region>West coast</region></placeName> I imagined that 
<lb/>it was a mode of suicide adopted by the <orgName>slaves</orgName>
<lb/>and their <orgName><term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> <orgName><term type="occupation">masters</term></orgName></orgName> shared the opinion
<lb/>and punished any one guilty of clay eating
<lb/>but here I found it to be a disease <hi rend="underline">per</hi> <hi rend="underline">se</hi> 
<lb/>and it attacks even rich men at <placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>who have none of the reasons that might
<lb/>make <orgName>slaves</orgName> desire to quit life - the earth 
<lb/>of old walls is preferred and to the sufferer
<lb/>it smells and tastes pleasantly - <persName>Muhamad</persName>'s
<lb/>brother was attacked and his wife told him
<lb/>of it on enquiry his brother was ashamed &amp; 
<lb/>denied it but his wife repeated - It is false 
<lb/>he is constantly picking out earth out of the 
<lb/>garden wall or little clods on the surface
<lb/>and eating them - the symptoms are swelling 
<lb/>of the face hands and feet - If the fingernail
<lb/>is squeezed it is bloodless - the patient is 
<lb/>oppressed with breathlessness and easily
<lb/>fatigued - though he is supplied with plenty 
<lb/>of food he constantly picks up dirt and 
<lb/>it appears in his dejections unchanged - 
<lb/>the swelled face feet &amp; hands &amp; bloodlessness
<lb/>continue to the end and many <orgName>slaves</orgName> die of 
<lb/><term type="ailment">Safura</term> - A remedy got from <choice><sic>Muhamads</sic><corr><persName>Muhamad</persName>'s</corr></choice>

<lb/>allowed to stand a few days and a wine

<lb/>It produced profuse vomiting &amp; purging

<lb/>attention was drawn to it when the elder
<lb/>brother of <persName>Syde bin Habib</persName> was killed in <placeName><region>Rua</region></placeName>
<lb/>by a night attack when a spear was pitched 
<lb/>through his tent into his side - <persName>Syde</persName> then
<lb/>vowed vengeance for the blood of his 
<lb/>brother and assaulted all he could find
<lb/>killing the elders and making the young 
<lb/>men <orgName>captives</orgName> - He had secured a very large

<lb/>roll between them and their free homes

<lb/>unchained as being now safe but all ran
<lb/>away at once while eight <add place="above">with many others</add> still in chains
<lb/>died in three days after crossing - they 
<lb/>ascribed their only pain to the heart, and 
<lb/>placed the hand correctly on the spot though
<lb/>many think that the organ stands high
<lb/>up under the breast bone - some expressed
<lb/>surprise to me that they should die seeing 
<lb/>they had plenty to eat and no work - one 
<lb/>fine boy of about 12 years was carried 
<lb/>and when about to expire was kindly
<lb/>laid down on the side of the path and 
<lb/>a hole dug to deposit the body - he too
<lb/>said he had nothing the matter with
<lb/>him except pain in his heart - as it
<lb/>attacks only the <orgName>free who are captured</orgName>
<lb/>and never <orgName>slaves</orgName> it seems to be really <del type="strikethrough">a</del>

<lb/>is put down before the other and <w>alter-

<lb/>and holds up a hand to any one to carry
<lb/>her - if refused she turns her face down
<lb/>and makes grimaces of the most bitter 
<lb/>human weeping - wringing her hands &amp;
<lb/>sometimes adding a fourth hand or foot
<lb/>to make the appeal more touching - with 
<lb/>grass or leaves she draws them around 
<lb/>her to make a nest - and resents anyone 
<lb/>meddling with her property - she began in
