2) Critical readings
	biogs focus on DL: so nothing happens or summarize sequential events (Bayly) or analyze fantasies & psychology
		Coupland: idle at Bambarre, little to record, ideas take mystic shape (83)
			lonliness, inaction, delay (90)
		Jeal, Explorers: deadliest pitfalls for explorer; superhuman determination (253)
			reading centers around DL's probs; A = backdrop; wide spread Ar-A fighting = greatest obstacle
		Jeal, DL: full chap to "Fantasy in Manyema" covers theories 
			of rivers, ambitions, factors for delay, health, diverse local circumstances, move into fanatsy: mixes Arab & classical sources
		Ransford: realms of imagination/visionary transcendentalism (262)
			more detail than usual on ulcers; medical emphasis, focus on psychology (264)
3) emphasis falls on DL's activities; with few exception don't grapple with bigger ideas, whether DL's ideas or global events (cf. Ross 216-17)
	don't conceptualize DL as immersed in teeming world motivated beyond his control
		fail to conceptualize central Africa as complex place that is not all about DL
	Arabs/Africans not individuals beyond a few key people (Bennett, AvE, 113-14)
		even Simpson focuses on attendants (porters, interpreters, guides; cf. Kennedy's: IM (163) & DL (170-71)) not local (cf. Bridges 1987, 191)
		few examples of Africans as Arabs/Africans as differentiated actors (Coupland 88)
	Letter from Bambarre marks end of stasis: elated mood, relfected in final part of diary
		relative lengths of FD v. UJ 
			July 1870-Jan 1871 = 3.25 pages, massive compression with only focus on diseases till Kirk's men come
			some instance of present tense, but mainly everything is retrospective and thoughts are already collected around topics
			inversion b/w FD & UJ shows what DL believes = valuable
			all deep/rich cultural detail of Bambarre compressed to a few longeurs & impressionistic travel experiences foregrounded
4) Published texts v sources
	critics use LLJ, pub vers of letters (Bennett), occasionally archival sources (Coupland, Seaver, Jeal, Ross)
		almost always to tell DL story, e.g. Bible reading for Exodous/Pentateuch (Seaver 547)
	Growing interest in original FDS: Bridges --> illustrated books --> spectral imaging
		complexities of production: 3 stages & complexities of stages (Bridges 1977, 3-4)
		heterogenous nature of contents; direct info from informers (what was heard) (Bridges 1987, 181)
			e.g. what DL learned from Cazembe (A22-23)
		DL's records are the best (Bridges 1987, 181)
	DL's story is least interesting of stories in 1870 FD, story is his obs; nothing fantastic; keen & detailed observer
		Ross calls it only "intellectual rambling" (218); look at what DL says, not what he does
	thanks top extended sojourn has left a unique and historically important record
		details Arab encroachment into CA (LXX)
	invent medial style for puproses b/w fd & journal
	circulating/layering of time & events; not usual progression
	Immediate unvarnished record
	diversity of info (cf. Bridges 1973, 7)
	value in what it tells re: Africa (Bridges 1973, 165)
		DL's growing interest in Africa (Bridges 1973, 6)
	teeming with people and geog & medical info
	step-by-step impact on local social dynamics
	scope of info circulation
	African guilability, learning to distrust, resistance

	ivory rush in Manyema; TT in Kasongo; Congo = key component of Z trade in late 1870s; focus on Ujjij (Bennett, AvE 113-16)
		Muhamad's people travel again to Metamba (XVII)
		just before Bambarre meets horde carrying 18k of ivory (XLII)
