DL conflates violence in country with cannibalism, no final word (UJ 646-648)

LXXXIII. my long detention in Manyema leads me to
believe that they are truly a bloody people - cold blooded
murders are frightfully common and they say that but for
our presence they would ^ be still more frequent - They have no
5fear of spears and shields - guns alone frighten them - they
tell us frankly and quite truly that but for our firearms not
one of us should even return to his country 


19) What has been left out: first hand arrival of work system; discovery and invention of resistance
		laments future of Africa, longs for restoration of Zerah and Tirhaka (XXXV)
		may be for best that DL = delayed (LXX)
		ends with ref to Dugumbe (Nyangwe instigator) and plans to go to market of region (CI)
