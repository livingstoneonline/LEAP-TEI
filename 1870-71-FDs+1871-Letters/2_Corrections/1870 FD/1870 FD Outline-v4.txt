1) What DL did in 1870
	story = non-story; letter retells cause; condemned to retell story; tale within a tale
	repeat references to intolerable delay
	what was DL doing on last journey (Bridges 1973, 165)
		attack slave trade with legit means (Bridges 1973, 166)
		return to halycon days of exploration; repeat success, crown ideas (Bridges 1973, 166-67)
		Nile = last chance for success; stand well in eyes of influential men; improve Africa (Bridges 1973, 168-70)
		transfers 56 dream to 73 (Jeal 1973, 174)
	DL seeks to solve Nile, connect to Moses, stop slave trade; need to trace Bangweulu to Nile (Jeal, Explorers 15-17)
	DL's route & plans (Seaver 537/539)
2) Critical readings
	biogs focus on DL: so nothing happens or summarize sequential events (Bayly) or analyze fantasies & psychology
		Coupland: idle at Bambarre, little to record, ideas take mystic shape (83)
			lonliness, inaction, delay (90)
		Jeal, Explorers: deadliest pitfalls for explorer; superhuman determination (253)
			reading centers around DL's probs; A = backdrop; wide spread Ar-A fighting = greatest obstacle
		Jeal, DL: full chap to "Fantasy in Manyema" covers theories of rivers, ambitions, factors for delay, health, diverse local circumstances, move into fanatsy: mixes Arab & classical sources
		Ransford: realms of imagination/visionary transcendentalism (262)
			more detail than usual on ulcers; medical emphasis, focus on psychology (264)
3) emphasis falls on DL's activities; with few exception don't grapple with bigger ideas, whether DL's ideas or global events (cf. Ross 216-17)
	don't conceptualize DL as immersed in teeming world motivated beyond his control
		fail to conceptualize central Africa as complex place that is not all about DL
	Arabs/Africans not individuals beyond a few key people (Bennett, AvE, 113-14)
		even Simpson focuses on attendants (porters, interpreters, guides) not local (cf. Bridges 1987, 191)
		few examples of Africans as Arabs/Africans as differentiated actors (Coupland 88)
	Letter from Bambarre marks end of stasis: elated mood, relfected in final part of diary
		relative lengths of FD v. UJ 
4) Published texts v sources
	critics use LLJ, pub vers of letters (Bennett), occasionally archival sources (Coupland, Seaver, Jeal, Ross)
		almost always to tell DL story, e.g. Bible reading for Exodous/Pentateuch (Seaver 547)
	Growing interest in original FDS: Bridges --> illustrated books --> spectral imaging
		complexities of production: 3 stages & complexities of stages (Bridges 1977, 3-4)
		heterogenous nature of contents; direct info from informers (what was heard) (Bridges 1987, 181)
		DL's records are the best (Bridges 1987, 181)
	DL's story is least interesting of stories in 1870 FD, story is his obs; nothing fantastic; keen & detailed observer
		Ross calls it only "intellectual rambling" (218); look at what DL says, not what he does
	thanks top extended sojourn has left a unique and historically important record, invent medial style for puproses b/w fd & journal
	circulating/layering of time & events; not usual progression
	Immediate unvarnished record
	diversity of info (cf. Bridges 1973, 7)
	value in what it tells re: Africa (Bridges 1973, 165)
		DL's growing interest in Africa (Bridges 1973, 6)
	teeming with people and geog & medical info
	step-by-step impact on local social dynamics
	scope of info circulation
	African guilability, learning to distrust, resistance
5) Situation in east Africa - historical
	World desire for ivory; push into Congo
	uses of ivory; London/Muslim/Asian needs; before rubber; Suze canal opens Indian ocean (Hyam 217-18)
	Euro ivory trade (Jeal, Explorers 21)
	world market, ivory, firearms; Z's arrive followed by Euros; diverse Zs (Northrup 21-23)
	move into Congo starting in 1868
		TT arrives from south, dev. of region
		Z's increase slavery; harems/porters needed (Northrup 21-27)
7) Ujiji and series of basis; diverse Arab activities; Belgian state
	Arab trading follows established routes: 3 routes into interior: central route focus on ivory (Bennet, AI, 216-19)
		customs define carrier standards (Rockell 6)
		Nyanwezi transport links local/global, is capitalist (Rockell 7)
		Euros don't understand Africa norms; dominant labor is slavery in Euro eyes (Rockell 10-11)
	Eldorado in 1870s = Z; previously regional trade west of LT (Sheriff 185)
	ivory rush in Manyema; TT in Kasongo; Congo = key component of Z trade in late 1870s; focus on Ujjij (Bennett, AvE 113-16)
	western penetrations = 2 prongs: 1) Kantanga, then when ivory goes north, 1867/68 (Sheriff 186-88)
	need to build own infrastructure, e.g. Nyangwe/Kasongo = centers (Sheriff 190); rise of Ujiji Bennet, AI, 226-29)
		Nyangwe 1871 (Wisnicki 2013, 211)
	TT organizes state (Vansina, Kingdoms 238)
	trading structure, indivs involved incl Arabs, depopulation in Manyema, expanding stations (Renault 148-50)
	whole zone in homogenous; Z sultan allegiance; maritime & continental trades linked (Renault 161-63)
		slaves as porters in eastern congo (Rockell 17)
8) Societies in Congo
	Bambarre just below rainforest (Northrup)
	1865-95: Zaire people lose autonomy (Arabs, Belgians), force region into world contact (Northrup 13)
	diversity; dense populations in area v. col. ethnic amalgamation; complexity of Lega neighbors (Northrup 14-15)
		differentiated econ, savanna, mix agrict, exchange of goods = normal part of life (Northrup 17)
	People south of forest show homogeneity (Vansina, Kingdoms 19)
	Complexity of Lega buffer populations such as BB (Biebuyck 5, 17)
		Wagenya can't be fixed (Wisnicki 2013, 222, 224)
9) Population in Bambarre
	Bangubangu linked to Lega (Biebuyck xix); southern Lega stress rels with BB and origins (Biebuyck 10, 18)
		links to Lega & Luba (Wisnicki 2013, 218-19)
	BB invented in late c19 (Biebuyck 19n); nickname given by Euros or Arabs (Boone 5)
	*BB et al
		Alt names, number of speakers today
		Ethnologue = distribution of BB & separate dialects
		Alt names, extent of territory (Maes and Boone 136-37)
		Two principal segments, very mixed population, few academic studies (Boone 11) 
	*Raucq
		gives pop as 31K (35)
		notes as one of most important populations in Maniema (36)
		descendants of Baluba and Wazimba (42); subgroup of Luba (44)
	*Iowa
		Neighboring populations
		hunters, originated near Lualalaba, influenced by Luba, now subsistence farmers
		religion notes
	*Maho
		places within Lega-Holoholo group linguistically (34)
	*Vansina, Kingdoms
		Map 3: Bangubangu surround Bambarre with Bembe and Hemba nearby
		Map 5: BB neighbors to north = Lega
	*Vansina, Ethno
		Map 4: Les Peuples du Kasai-Katanga (BB included)
		*KK section in translation
			People of KK 
			Luba influence on BB = early c19 
			patrilineal and viripatrilocaux
	*Explorers
		Moenekuss = Kasongo's father (Cameron 66)
		Kasongo = Warua (Cameron 67)
		skulls of rebellious brothers & chiefs (Cameron 67)
		extent of Kasongo's territory (Cameron 68-69)
		brutality of Kasongo (Cameron 69)
		religion and idols (Cameron 71-72)
		DL's stands up for population; memory is cherished (Stanley 79-80)
		Moenemgoi (Stanley 80-81)
	Modern account (Butcher)
10) Violence of traders
	DL speaks from lawless terrain; lack of force = weakness
11) Violence of followers
		slaves = marauders (Northrup 29)
12) DL rep of helplessness & intervention need
	purchase of wives rather than slaves; low slaves II low econ/political dev, linked to geog/isolation (Northrup 19-20)
	isolation => inhabitants not ready to resist
13) new narrative style, juxtapose ideas (e.g. I-III and IV); acts as armchair
	1st gathering alternates first-hand obs on local practices/social dynamics with narr of own travels, complaints about Nassickers & narr of obs gathered from others
	after Stanley letter, DL presents variety of random notes; broad scope of topics
14) What DL says about self
	places own work in historical continuum
		elaborate review of know. sources on Nile, DL, Arabs, Africans, historical sources, more recent explorers
	detailed account of how we got to present on most recent leg of travels
	stream of consciousness mixes feelings & events (XI)
	DL's story circles around a few bit themes: Nile theories, ulcers, despair at Arab behavior, frustration at delay, grudges, lost letters, isolation, intractable Nassickers (Jeal, Explorers, 18-29); Bosher exploitation (Coupland 96-99)
14) Scale and scope of information
	describes impediments to own movements, but dreams of Arab mobility
		Bambarre letter gives UK info, but DL already has broad scope
		DL fused with Arabs; their identity is his identity
		complicity and guilt in bringing violence to Central Africa
	info via Arab travels; reports news of each trading party as it comes in; significant crush to west and north
	diary of Arab encroachment into interior and effects on local social dynamics
	news via Arab parties - lines of communication in central Africa
15) African culture & practices, eg. medical practices
	DL differentiates populations vaguely: Ujijians, Suaheli, Moslems, Manyema, Bambarre people, other tribes
16) African
	series of anecdotes about chiefs
	local social dynamics, practices, history
	mapping geog info, collecting vocabulary
	glossary as window on scale of local knowledge
	increasing resistance
17) Cannibalism
	Manyema = country of cannibals (see letter to Stanley)
18) What has been left out: first hand arrival of work system; discovery and invention of resistance
