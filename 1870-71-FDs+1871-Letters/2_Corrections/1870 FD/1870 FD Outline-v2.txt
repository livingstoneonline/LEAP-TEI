1) What DL did in 1870
	story = non-story; letter retells cause; condemned to retell story; tale within a tale
	repeat references to intolerable delay
2) Critical readings
	biogs focus on DL: so nothing happens or summarize sequential events or analyze fantasies & psychology
	don't conceptualize DL as immersed in teeming world motivated beyond his control
		fail to conceptualize central Africa as complex place that is not all about DL
	Arabs/Africans not individuals beyond a few key people
		even Simpson focuses on attendants (porters, interpreters, guides) not local
	Letter from Bambarre marks end of stasis: elated mood, relfected in final part of diary
		relative lengths of FD v. UJ 
4) Published texts v sources
	critics use LLJ, pub vers of letters
	Growing interest in original FDS: Bridges --> illustrated books --> spectral imaging
		complexities of production
		heterogenous nature of contents
	DL's story is least interesting of stories in 1870 FD, story is his obs
	extended sojurn
	circulating/layering of time & events; not usual progression
	Immediate unvarnished record
	diversity of info
	teeming with people and geog & medical info
	step-by-step impact on local social dynamics
	scope of info circulation
	African guilability, learning to distrust, resistance
5) Situation in east Africa - historical
6) World desire for ivory; push into Congo
7) Ujiji and series of basis; diverse Arab activities; Belgian state
8) Societies in Congo
9) Population in Bambarre
10) Violence of traders
	DL speaks from lawless terrrain; lack of force = weakness
11) Violence of followers
12) DL rep of helplessness & intervention need
13) new narrative style, juxtapose ideas (e.g. I-III and IV); acts as armchair
	1st gathering alternates first-hand obs on local practices/social dynamics with narr of own travels, complaints about Nassickers & narr of obs gathered from others
	after Stanley letter, DL presents variety of random notes; broad scope of topics
14) What DL says about self
	places own work in historical continuum
		elaborate review of know. sources on Nile, DL, Arabs, Africans, historical sources, more recent explorers
	detailed account of how we got to present on most recent leg of travels
	stream of consciousness mixes feeelings & events (XI)
	DL's story circles around a few bit themes: Nile theories, ulcers, despair at Arab behavior, frustration at delay, grudges, lost letters, isolation
14) Scale and scope of information
	describes impediments to own movements, but dreams of Arab mobility
		Bambarre letter gives UK info, but DL already has broad scope
		DL fused with Arabs; their identity is his identity
		complicity and guilt in bringing violence to Central Africa
	info via Arab travels; reports news of each trading party as it comes in; significant crush to west and north
	diary of Arab encroachment into interior and effects on local social dynamics
	news via Arab parties - lines of communication in central Africa
15) African culture & practices, eg. medical practices
	DL differentiates populations vaguely: Ujijians, Suaheli, Moslems, Manyema, Bambarre people, other tribes
16) African
	series of anecdotes about chiefs
	local social dynamics, practices, history
	mapping geog info, collecting vocabulary
	glossary as window on scale of local knowledge
	increasing resistance
17) Cannibalism
	Manyema = country of cannibals (see letter to Stanley)
18) What has been left out: first hand arrival of work system; discovery and invention of resistance
