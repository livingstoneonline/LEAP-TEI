Gen notes
DL = similar to armchair geographer, reports, synthesizes, theorizes
Extended cultural notes and observations
Speaks from lawless terrain, lack of force = weakness
Weaves layers of time in first gathering
First gathering - general obs: alternates first-hand obs on local practices and social dynamics, with narr of own travels, complaints about Nassickers, narr of obs gathered from others
Second gathering - moves backwards in historical time, v. other explorers, armchair discoverers = broad contextulization, even more recent explorers all stop short of source farther south
Kaleidoscopic shifts in focus, cf I-III and IV
Travels in time, travels in space
Detailed account of how he got to the present, on most recent leg of travels; reads like a letter
Diary of Arab encroachments into interior and effects on local social dynamics; new news comes in via arrival of Arab trading parties - lines of communication in Central Africa
Elaborate review of knowledge sources on Nile River: DL, Arabs, Africans, historical sources, more recent explorers
Stream of consciousness mixes feelings with events (see eg. XI)
Dreams of mobility of Arab traders while describing all impediments to his movements
Explores own desires: find source of Nile; confirm Moses/Kingdom of Tirhaka
Series of anecdotes about local chiefs
Increasing resistance of Africans to Arabs
Slow evolving of story/details -- see Katomba's men
Story = non-story; letter retells cause
DL's identity fused with Arabs; their story is his story
= story of DL's inability to carry forward, as detailed in Stanley letter
Tale within a tale, recaps to get to present; condemed to retell story
