Gen notes
DL = similar to armchair geographer, reports, synthesizes, theorizes
Extended cultural notes and observations
Speaks from lawless terrain, lack of force = weakness
Weaves layers of time in first gathering
First gathering - general obs: alternates first-hand obs on local practices and social dynamics, with narr of own travels, complaints about Nassickers, narr of obs gathered from others
Second gathering - moves backwards in historical time, v. other explorers, armchair discoverers = broad contextulization, even more recent explorers all stop short of source farther south
Kaleidoscopic shifts in focus, cf I-III and IV
Travels in time, travels in space
Detailed account of how he got to the present, on most recent leg of travels; reads like a letter
Diary of Arab encroachments into interior and effects on local social dynamics; new news comes in via arrival of Arab trading parties - lines of communication in Central Africa
Elaborate review of knowledge sources on Nile River: DL, Arabs, Africans, historical sources, more recent explorers
