<lb/><p><placeName><settlement type="village">Bambarre</settlement></placeName> = <placeName><region>Manyema</region></placeName><date when="1871-02-05">5 Feb 1871</date></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Waller</persName> - I yesterday <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> gladly your 3
<lb/>letters of <date when="1869-10"><choice><abbr>Oct<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi></abbr><expan>October</expan></choice></date><date when="1869-11"><choice><abbr>Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi></abbr><expan>November</expan></choice></date><date when="1869-12"><choice><abbr>Dec<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi></abbr><expan>December</expan></choice></date> 1869 <space dim="horizontal" extent="4"/>You repeat the dose which 
<lb/>is like to break my heart - You "gave <persName>Kirk</persName> all the news and 
<lb/>he would impart them to me" but he had other matters to 
<lb/>attend to and as usual I have to whistle for news - I am
<lb/>the man with too many friends - Oh says Muff <choice><abbr>N<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi></abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice> 1 such
<lb/>a nice book has come out - I would send it but you have so 
<lb/>many friends I am sure that someone must have sent it 
<lb/>already - <choice><abbr>N</abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice>2 says I would have given you the news but
<lb/>you have so many friends &amp;c &amp;c - <choice><abbr>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi></abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice> 3 says our large 
<lb/>national educational establishment in which I have the 
<lb/>honour to free a chair ought to help if not take on them 
<lb/>the education of your children - I would do it myself but 
<lb/>you have so many friends &amp;c - The upshot is I <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> nothing</p>
<lb/><p>Two great friends removed my three boys at my expense 
<lb/>and against my wish from a healthy school in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>to an abominable "Do the boys Hall" in <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName> &amp; they were 
<lb/>all home sick three months afterwards - ! I am glad of 
<lb/>all you told me when you forgot the idea of others telling 
<lb/>me and wrote naturally as a married man ought to do 
<lb/>I did not know of <persName>Young</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice> trip up after me nor of <persName>Musa</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice>
<lb/>lies till now - The successful laying of the <placeName><geogName>Atlantic</geogName></placeName> cable 
<lb/>I Enferred from my Canadian brother saying "last cable 
<lb/>news told us you were alive &amp; we put off our mourning" 
<lb/>I infer that a new Government or ministry is in
<lb/>power because you speak of <persName>John Bright</persName> &amp; <persName>Duke Argyll</persName>
<lb/>as ministers - Well I am off in a few days to finish 
<lb/>with the help of the Almighty new explorations - Ten 
<lb/>men here come from <persName>Kirk</persName> who like the good fellow 
<lb/>that he is worked unweariedly to get them &amp; goods off in 
<lb/>the midst of disease and death â€“ one gang of porters died 
<lb/>quite off and five of my men perished by <term type="ailment">cholera</term> - We get that 
<lb/>from <placeName><settlement type="city">Mecca</settlement></placeName> - letters preceded it thence saying it was coming - 
<lb/>We do nothing to stop its hatching in <placeName><settlement type="city">Mecca</settlement></placeName><placeName><settlement type="city">Medina</settlement></placeName> &amp; <placeName><settlement type="city">Judda</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>which annually become vast cesspools of abomination 
<lb/>because the new political economy says let everything alone 
<lb/>Formerly it went along shore now it comes inland - In our 
<lb/>small camp here we lost 30 &amp; how many <term type="tribe">Manyema</term> no one 
<lb/>knows - All the able bodied all off ivory collecting - if it had 
<lb/>continued three instead of two months the camp would have 
<lb/>been desolate - Fowls &amp; goats fell first then cattled shivered 
<lb/>and died &amp; then men. I quite expect to hear that it went to the 
<lb/><placeName>Cape</placeName> - I got the copy of the Standard you sent - I have not seen 
<lb/>the "Times" for an age - I differ from you for I am proud 
<lb/>of our great Paper and only sorry when it admits the babble 
<lb/>of the clubs - Jupiter must be nodding when he admits <persName>Cooley</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice>
<lb/>ill natured twaddle as "geography". I would not answer him 
<lb/>why he boldly challenged me to argue the point whether the great 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> above the <placeName><geogName type="feature"><choice><abbr>falls</abbr><expan>Victoria Falls</expan></choice></geogName></placeName> were a river - He maintained that it 
<lb/>was "an undeveloped river" that went under the ground of 
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName>Kalahari</geogName></placeName> and was lost, and in what he called a map 
<lb/>put it down as ending in a pothook - doubtless meaning 
<lb/>if the "learned" the "erudite" Cooley could be so low as use a 
<lb/>hieroglyphic to say "here it hooks it" - that shut me up from 
<lb/>answering for ever - My work leads me down <placeName><geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>in canoes till it touches the head of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName> probably near 
<lb/>the Eastern arm followed down by <persName>Speke</persName><persName>Grant</persName> &amp; <persName>Baker</persName>
<lb/>then double back up the Western line of drainage to the 
<lb/>fountains on the <placeName><geogName>Watershead</geogName></placeName> - on return I shall not
<lb/>go down the Western arm of the loop formed by the end 
<lb/>of <persName>Baker</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice> water and <unclear cert="medium">it - the</unclear> Northern part of which
