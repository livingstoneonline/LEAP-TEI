<br/>your attention to the question of free 
<br/>navigation on this river which I have 
<br/>brought before <span class="">Lord John Russell</span> - The 
<br/>Portuguese make no use of the <span class="">river Zambesi</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>below this point, nor have they ever 
<br/>ascended the <span class="">Shire</span> more than a few miles 
<br/>above the confluence - their line of 
<br/>exploration ran across country from 
<br/><span class="">Sofala</span> to <span class="">Senna</span>, and then down to <span class="">Quilimane</span>. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>The Governor of <span class="">Tette</span> acknowledges in a

<br/>Argus</span> in <span class="">August last</span>, that we are the first

<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>not object to own their lordship over 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>parts known or traded to by them, but 
<br/>we have opened a new region by going 
<br/>up the <span class="">Shire</span>; and <span class="">Burton</span> &amp; <span class="">Speke</span> have 
<br/>explored that region still farther, and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>confirmed what we advanced respecting 
<br/>the form and fertility of the country, as 
<br/>well as the disposition of the inhabitants: 
<br/>And it seems feasible to suppose that

<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>would both <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: develop">develope</span> the trade in cotton, 
<br/>and soon stop the supply of <span class="">slaves</span> to

<br/>I am so fully persuaded of this, that 
<br/>should the <span class="">Government</span> not grant 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the means of placing a small steamer 
<br/>on <span class="">Nyassa</span> to afford protection to settlers

<br/>be up in arms against it, and put on 
<br/>restrictions that will prove real obstructions.

<br/>free passage in to our discoveries; and 
<br/>our success without diminishing their 
<br/>territory an inch, would promote the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>prosperity of their establishments - You 
<br/>will appreciate my earnestness in this 
<br/>matter when you remember that their 
<br/>settlements are not colonies, but small 
<br/>penal settlements entailing a loss of £5000 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>or £6000 annually on the mother country, 
<br/>and sending not a particle of trade home; 
<br/>and never a single <span class="">African</span> made fortune 
<br/>to be spent there. The <span class="">Governors</span>, no matter 
<br/>what professions they make all get as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>much into their pockets from <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> traders</span> 
<br/>as possible. The present <span class="">Governor General 
<br/>of <span class="">Mosambique</span></span> - an educated &amp; enlightened 
<br/>man - winked at a regular system of 
<br/>French <span class="">slave</span> emigration from near <span class="">Quilimane</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>for two years - and then when the affair 
<br/>of the Charles &amp; Georges caused a stir in 
<br/><span class="">Europe</span>, made a formal <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: denunciation">denuntiation</span> in 
<br/>the "<span class="">Boletin of Mozambique</span>" of those who 
<br/>carried it on. It was carried on under 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the very eye of the <span class="">Governor of <span class="">Quilimane</span></span>. 
<br/>It was well known to His <span class="">Excellency of 
<br/><br/>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/><span class="">Mosambique</span></span> for everything is reported, 
<br/>and each Governor knows even the 
<br/>private affairs of all the people of his district - 
<br/>When this <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: denunciation">denuntiation</span> appeared the emigration 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>agent <span class="">(Senhor Cruz)</span> retired to <span class="">Bombay</span>,
<br/>and thence to <span class="">Bourbon</span>; and as every 
<br/>one expected, has now returned to <span class="">Quilimane</span>
<br/>to carry on the same or a worse system - 
<br/>People here talk openly of the Governors 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>being bribed to allow these things - and from 
<br/>all I have seen of the officials, I feel certain 
<br/>that they would hamper a movement 
<br/>such as I propose by every means in 
<br/>their power - We want only free access 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>by harbours and parts of the river of 
<br/>which the Portuguese make no use 
<br/>whatever - to parts quite beyond their 
<br/>trade and even geographical knowledge - </p>

<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>if we exclude the <span class="">military</span> there are not 
<br/>20 real Portuguese on the river and 
<br/>only 150 or 200 <span class="">half casts</span>. <span class="">Portugal</span> does 
<br/>not intend to send colonists - those 
<br/>actually sent are a class of military 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>called "<span class="">Incorrigibles</span>" and the chief trade 
<br/>which is only paltry peddling in ivory 
<br/>and gold dust is in the hands of 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><span class="marginleft ">3/</span> the few officers employed to look after 
<br/>these worthies - The exclusive - "dog in the 
<br/>manger" policy pursued, is almost entirely 
<br/>for the benefit of these men - No women 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>are sent out, and frightful immorality is 
<br/>the consequence - I say little about them 
<br/>publicly, because I have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> much 
<br/>kindness from individuals among them - 
<br/>but a more <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: used-up">used up</span> syphilitic <span class="">race</span> does 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>not exist in the world - With a soil and 
<br/>climate superior to <span class="">Natal</span> we can get neither 
<br/>fresh meat nor vegetables between the sea &amp; 
<br/><span class="">Tette</span> for either love or money - On the coast 
<br/>we get abundance of game &amp; live splendidly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>bushbuck - waterbuck &amp; the oryx abound 
<br/>but inland the grass is too tall for hunting, 
<br/>and we are put on salt provisions or 
<br/>starve - I have laid the whole matter before 
<br/><span class="">Lord John Russell</span>, and if you can say a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>word in behalf of urging a more open 
<br/>system on the Portuguese, you will confer 
<br/>a great favour = I do not know 
<br/>whether a silent system might work 
<br/>out our ends - If we were allowed to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>hoist a pendant the officials could not 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>interfere with us, yet I fear the opposition 
<br/>of the whole population when they see 
<br/>whither our efforts tend in eating out 
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> - They are rather glad at 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>having cleverly as they think, restricted my 
<br/><span class="">consulate</span> to <span class="">Quilimane</span>, and I say 
<br/>nothing respecting my being accredited 
<br/>to the independent tribes beyond them. </p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: The">the</span> loss of the mail bag, (though I hear 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of its having been picked up in a damaged 
<br/>state and conveyed to <span class="">Tette</span>) has entailed 
<br/>ignorance of the intentions of <span class="">Government</span> 
<br/>respecting the "Bann" which my Naval 
<br/>officer led me to reject, or another steamer. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>If we get a powerful vessel we intend 
<br/>to try to reach <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span> by the <span class="">Rovuma</span>
<br/>a river which is said to flow out of it, 
<br/>and to be navigable <span class="">100 leagues</span> inland - 
<br/>It is beyond <span class="">Portuguese territory</span>, and from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>its situation on the map appears to be about 
<br/>what we conjecture to be the <span class="">Northern end 
<br/>of that Lake</span>. It has a <span class="">depth of three fathoms</span> 
<br/>at the entrance and no bar - but free 
<br/>navigation here would answer our purpose 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>as well.</p>

<br/><p class="p ">I need scarcely say that I am as 
<br/>sorry as any one on account of 
<br/>your departure from the <span class="">Cape</span> -
<br/>But I hope it may be only to
