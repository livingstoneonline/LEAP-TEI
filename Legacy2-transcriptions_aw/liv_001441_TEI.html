<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">                  </span>My Dear Sir George </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space">                                                </span>We have lately 
<br/>discovered a very fine Lake by going 
<br/>up this river in the steam Launch 
<br/>about <span class="">one hundred miles</span> and then 
<br/>marching some <span class="">fifty more</span> on foot. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>It is called <span class="">Shirwa</span> and <span class="">Lake 
<br/>Ngami</span> is a mere pond in comparison
<br/>It is moreover particularly interesting 
<br/>from the fact reported by the 
<br/><span class="">natives</span> on its shores that it is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>separated by a strip of land of 
<br/>only <span class="">five or six miles in width</span> 
<br/>from <span class="">Nyanja</span> or rather  <span class="">Lake 
<br/>Nyinyesi</span> = the stars - which <span class="">Burton</span>
<br/>has gone to explore. We could 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>hear nothing of <span class="">his party</span> at 
<br/><span class="">Shirwa</span> and having got no 
<br/><span class="">European</span> news since you 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>kindly sent some copies of the 
<br/>"<span class="">Times</span>" <span class="">last year</span> we are quite in the 
<br/>dark as to whether he has succeeded 
<br/>or not. <span class="">Lake Shirwa</span> has no 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>outlet and its waters are bitter but 
<br/>drinkable. It abounds in fishes 
<br/>Leeches alligators &amp; hippopotami. 
<br/>We discovered also by examining 
<br/>partially a branch of the <span class="">Shire</span> called 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Ruo</span> that one portion of <span class="">Shirwa</span>
<br/>is not more than <span class="">30 miles</span> distant 
<br/>from a point that may easily be 
<br/>reached by this Launch which by 
<br/>Newspaper measurement draws <span class="">13 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>inches</span>, and actually <span class="">31 inches</span> - the 
<br/><span class="">Lake Shirwa</span> is very grand. It is 
<br/>surrounded on all sides by lofty green 
<br/>mountains - <span class="">Dzomba</span> or as people 
<br/>nearest it say <span class="">Zomba</span> is over <span class="">6000 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>feet high</span> of same shape as <span class="">Table 
<br/>mountain</span> but inhabited on the top 
<br/>others are equally high but inaccessible
<br/>It is a high land region - the Lake itself 
<br/>being about <span class="">2000 ft</span> above the sea</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p ">It is <span class="">20 or 30 miles wide</span> - and 
<br/><span class="">50 or 60 long</span> - On going some way 
<br/>up a hill we saw in the far distance 
<br/>two mountain tops rising like little 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>islands on a watery horizon - An 
<br/>inhabited mountain island stands near 
<br/>where we first came to it - From the 
<br/>size of the waves it is supposed to 
<br/>be deep - <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Maclear</span> will shew you the map.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p "><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> and I with 15 Makololo 
<br/>formed the <span class="">land party</span> - the country 
<br/>is <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: well-peopled">well peopled</span> and very much 
<br/>like <span class="">Londa</span> in the middle of the 
<br/>country - many streams rising 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>out of bogs - the vegetation nearly 
<br/>identical also. Never saw so 
<br/>much cotton grown as among 
<br/>the Mang-anja of the <span class="">Shire</span> &amp; 
<br/><span class="">Shirwa</span> valleys - all spin and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>weave it. These are the Latitudes 
<br/>which I have always pointed out 
<br/>as the cotton and sugar lands 
<br/>they are pre-eminently so - but 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>such is the disinterestedness of some people 
<br/>that labour is exported to <span class="">Bourbon</span> instead 
<br/>of being employed here - The only trade the 
<br/>people have is that of <span class="">slaves</span>; and the only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>symptoms of impudence we met were 
<br/>from a <span class="">party of <span class="">Bajaua</span> <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> traders</span></span>
<br/>but they changed their deportment instantly 
<br/>on hearing that we were English and 
<br/>not Portuguese - There are no <span class="">Maravi</span> at 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>or near <span class="">Shirwa</span> - They are all <span class="">West of 
<br/>the <span class="">Shire</span></span> so this Lake can scarcely be 
<br/>called "<span class="">Lake Maravi</span> - <span class="del cancelled">but</span> the Portuguese 
<br/>know nothing of it. but the Minister who 
<br/>claimed <span class="add  above">(<span class="">Blue book for <span class="">1857</span></span>)</span> the honour of first traversing the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">African</span> continent for two <span class="underline ">black men</span>
<br/>with Portuguese names - must explain 
<br/>why they did not cross <span class="">Shirwa</span> - It lies 
<br/>some <span class="">forty or fifty miles</span> on each side 
<br/>of the Latitude of <span class="">Mosambique</span> -</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p ">(They came to <span class="">Tette</span> only &amp; lacked at 
<br/>least <span class="">400 miles</span> of <span class="">Mosambique</span>). We go 
<br/>back to <span class="">Shirwa</span> in <span class="">July</span> and may 
<br/>make a push for <span class="">Nyinyesi</span> but say 
<br/>nothing at present about it. We have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>not told the Portuguese how near <span class="">Shirwa</span> 
<br/>is to them - We let that come to them from 
<br/>our own <span class="">Government</span> but they mean to 
<br/>claim all by setting up a station forthwith at 
<br/>the mouth of this river! <span class="">David Livingstone</span></p>
