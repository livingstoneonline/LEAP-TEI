<br/><p class="p ">Dear Sir George</p> 
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                          </span>We have been very much 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>baffled in our work since you left and our 
<br/>prospects now are far from bright - We are 
<br/>engaged in the transport of the steamer "the 
<br/>Lady of the Lake" past <span class="">Murchison's cataracts</span> 
<br/>and while hoping to do something effectual 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>towards stopping a <span class="">stream of <span class="">slaves</span></span> of above 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: 20,000">20 000</span> annually that passes from the 
<br/>Lake region towards <span class="">Quiloa</span> - the <span class="">Red Sea</span> and 
<br/><span class="">Persian Gulph</span>, we look back ruefully 
<br/>on the doings of the Portuguese behind us - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>It is but lately that I have come to understand 
<br/>their system - because during the past 
<br/>few years the French <span class="">slave</span> emigration was 
<br/>chiefly supplied by raids to the <span class="">North</span> of <span class="">Quillimane</span>
<br/>and we saw but little of it - the valley of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the <span class="">Zambesi</span> had previously been depopulated. 
<br/>Last year however the <span class=""><span class="">Tette</span> people</span> followed 
<br/>on our spoor - supplied one tribe with guns 
<br/>and ammunition to be paid in <span class="">slaves</span> - 
<br/>The tribe attacked fled to the <span class="">Shire</span> - famine 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>succeeded and we saw as we ascended 
<br/>many dead bodies floating past the victims 
<br/>of famine and slave hunting - Another person 
<br/>engaged in <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> hunting</span> in the country 
<br/>adjacent to <span class="">Mount Clarendon</span> - He is a <span class="">half 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>caste</span> and is said to possess a thousand 
<br/>armed <span class="">slaves</span> - flight to the river and famine 
<br/>have done their work lower down than 
<br/>where the <span class=""><span class="">Tette</span> people</span> have acted - Two others 
<br/>have set up <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> hunting</span> on their own 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>responsibility and the authorities never 
<br/>interfere until the marauder has accumulated 
<br/>spoil enough to make him worth squeezing</p>
<br/>
	
<br/><p class="ab ">The missionaries fled down to <span class=""><span class="">Chibisa</span>'s</span> &amp; are "as well as could be expected"</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p noindent">This system going on with the connivance of 
<br/>the <span class="">Governors</span> - We caught some of the 
<br/>Governor of <span class="">Tette</span>'s own <span class="">slaves</span> at it - It seems
<br/>evident that the good effects expected from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the operations of the cruizers cannot be 
<br/>realized - In the <span class="">West</span> great success has 
<br/>attended their efforts in the way the promoters 
<br/>of the suppression policy intended - the 
<br/><span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> was repressed for a time to allow 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the influences of Christianity to extend inland
<br/>At least 20 <span class="">missions</span> have been established 
<br/>an equal number of dialects have been 
<br/>reduced to writing - thousands are educated 
<br/>about <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: 12,000">12 000</span> communicants are members 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of the different churches, and lawful trade 
<br/>has extended from <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: £20,000">£20 000</span> annually to 
<br/>between £2,000,000 and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: £3,000,000">£3 000 000</span> - Indeed 
<br/>a greater amount of tonnage is now 
<br/>engaged in legal trade than was formerly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>employed in that in <span class="">slaves</span> - But on this 
<br/>coast it is still the old system of paltry 
<br/>peddling in ivory and gold dust and <span class="">slaving</span> 
<br/>as often as there is opportunity - If none 
<br/>but a few convict Portuguese had been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>allowed to enter the <span class="">West</span> the same results 
<br/>would have followed as here - and 
<br/>unless the navigation of the <span class="">Zambesi</span> &amp; 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">and</span> <span class="">Shire</span> is made free to all nations 
<br/>I doubt whether we can effect much 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>When the passions of these <span class="">Africans</span> are 
<br/>enlisted on the side of wrong the case is 
<br/>difficult - Fortunately we have in <span class="">Earl 
<br/>Russell</span> a man who will do all that 
<br/>can be done to promote freedom of both 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>black and white - and in <span class="">Lord Palmerston</span> 
<br/>who is <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: pre-eminently">pre eminently</span> the author of the

<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">the</span> suppression policy we have one who 
<br/>has done more <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: illegible">[      ]</span> the good of <span class="">Africa</span> 
<br/>than any one who can be mentioned
<br/>Being under him one cannot speak out 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>all that is felt in reviewing his long &amp; 
<br/>unwearied labours for the abolition of 
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> - without appearing to be a 
<br/>toady and that does not lie in my 
<br/>line - I hope that something may be done 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and think the Portuguese might yield it 
<br/>as they never use the mouths of the 
<br/><span class="">Zambesi</span> or <span class="">Shire</span> at all -</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The death of <span class="">bishop Mackenzie</span> was a 
<br/>great misfortune as it created <span class="del cancelled">as</span> a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>prejudice - and half of the exposure <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">in <span class="">England</span></span> he 
<br/>subjected himself to would have led to 
<br/>his being quickly cut off by consumption
<br/>We have had our losses too from being 
<br/>compelled to delay a long time in a most 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>unhealthy locality - but these cases 
<br/>are accidental - We have the prospect 
<br/>of half a dozen <span class="">Scotch mechanics</span> joining 
<br/>us soon - They worked at their trades 
<br/>in <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low"><span class="">Shiwal North</span></span> and <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Burnet</span> the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>commissioner gives a good report 
<br/>of them - Their wages went to a common 
<br/>fund out of which waggons were bought 
<br/>and they were ready to proceed overland 
<br/>when the Governor asked me if they 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>might not rather be sent by sea - They 
<br/>seem just the men we want and 
<br/>I have recommended them to try 
<br/>and set an example of independent 
<br/>industry and Christian life before 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the inhabitants of the Lake - </p>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/><p class="p ">We went up the <span class="">Rovuma</span> about 
<br/><span class="">156 miles or 114 as the crow flies</span> during 
<br/><span class="">September</span> &amp; <span class="">October</span> last - People near the 
<br/>coast unfriendly but further inland 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>all we could expect - the lands on each 
<br/>bank rise up <span class="">400 or 500 feet</span> - the edge 
<br/>of a plateau though they look like ranges 
<br/>of hills - the country <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: well-wooded">well wooded</span> &amp; 
<br/>fertile - pieces of coal seen in the sands 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>but tsetse prevails - the river takes 
<br/>us twice on to the <span class="">slave</span> route from 
<br/><span class="">Nyassa</span> to <span class="">Quiloa</span> - we turned at some 
<br/>low rapids about <span class="">eleven <span class="">Arab</span> days</span> 
<br/>from <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span> - <span class="">One day above our 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>turning point</span> the <span class="">Rovuma</span> is joined 
<br/>by the <span class="">Liendi</span> which rises on the mountains 
<br/><span class="">East of the Lake</span>. <span class="">Rovuma</span> is still said 
<br/>to come out of it as formerly but the 
<br/>passage is narrow and down rocks 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>this will be our outlet rather than pay 
<br/>dues to Portuguese but it is hard to 
<br/>leave the route we opened &amp; rendered 
<br/>safe to vile <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> hunters</span> -</p>

<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Maclear</span> that you are succeeding in 
<br/>your labours - You have our heartiest 
<br/>good wishes - If you still wish to do
