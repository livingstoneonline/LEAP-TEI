<br/>and we shall send more when 
<br/>we can - there are plants

<br/>to which it is annually liable - From

<br/>During four or five months 
<br/>each year large vessels could 
<br/>ascend to <span class="">Tette</span> - There the river

<br/><span class="small ">about three times the width of <span class="">Thames</span> at <span class=""><span class="">London</span> Bridge</span></span>
<br/>at the broadest parts it is 
<br/>about <span class="">3 miles</span>, and divided 
<br/>into five or six channels - A 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Tide Pole put up at my suggestion 
<br/>by <span class="">Major Secard</span> shewed a 
<br/>gradual rise above low 
<br/>water mark of <span class="">eight feet</span> - then 
<br/>a variation <span class="">from 8 to fifteen feet</span>

<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>The channels then contained reaches 
<br/>of miles in length of <span class="">8 or 10 feet</span> - 
<br/>but in the crossings we had

<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>old copper kettle full of holes 
<br/>at one part - We are about to 
<br/>try <span class="">Nyinyesi</span> from the <span class="">Shire</span>, 
<br/>if she will only stick together so 
<br/>long. The <span class="">Shire</span> is more easily navigated 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>from the <span class="">Zambesi</span> as we have <span class="">2 or 3 
<br/>fathoms</span> constantly &amp; can steam by

<br/>a <span class="">thirty mile</span> difficulty of getting on the
