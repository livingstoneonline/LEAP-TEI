<br/>I was unable to write and

<br/>contains the Sichuana tongue 
<br/>chiefly, but I had begun 
<br/>to put in the dialect of The 
<br/>Barotse immediately after 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the Sichuana thus "Sichuana = 
<br/>= serotse = English - I did this 
<br/>partly because it was easier 
<br/>to translate the serotse into 
<br/>Sichuana, but chiefly because

<br/><p class="p ">Towards the end of the

<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the Balojazi and Ambonda far to the 
<br/><span class="">N.N.W. of that point</span> -</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In the calico covers there is 
<br/>a number of Angolese words the 
<br/>dialect being termed Bunda or 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Ambunda - I think I made a 
<br/>mistake in marking them 
<br/>as Serotse - <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Bleek</span> will be 
<br/>able to detect which is which 
<br/>by comparing them with the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>words in the tables in the 
<br/><span class="">larger volume</span>, and noting a 
<br/>form of swearing which I 
<br/>could not understand but was 
<br/>told it was equal to "by the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>holy sacraments" - Then we 
<br/>have some of the Londa or

<br/><p class="p ">I am sorry the whole is so imperfect. 
<br/>The Sichuana contains most of the 
<br/>words in common use but by no 
<br/>means the whole language - We are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>perpetually picking up new words 
<br/>and even in the short period of 
<br/>my absence in <span class="">England</span> I see by 
<br/>the parts of the <span class="">bible</span> brought down 
<br/>by <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Moffat</span> that he has gathered 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>a good many that I never heard
<br/>Should you deem the matter sent 
<br/>worth printing my companions 
<br/>would be very thankful for 
<br/>copies in order to aid them in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>acquiring the language, and 
<br/>having begged for them I feel 
<br/>as if the way was paved for 
<br/>hinting that an interleaved 
<br/>copy for myself would be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>about as civil a thing as you 
<br/>could do - The number of 
<br/>blank leaves being proportioned 
<br/>to the frequency of the initial 
<br/>sounds - in mo - li - &amp;c  - and the 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>deficiencies in some of the dialects - 
<br/>If I had the Sichuana so printed 
<br/>as to allow corresponding words 
<br/>to be put in Londa - Maravi - &amp;c &amp;c 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>on the same line in the interleaved 
<br/>page I think I could <span class="del cancelled">put</span> collect 
<br/>as many words as have served 
<br/>to translate <span class="">bible</span> in the course of 
<br/>two years.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">As I am in the way of begging 
<br/>may I ask your Excellency to 
<br/>get <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Moffat</span> to go over the 
<br/>analysis and add or expunge what 
<br/>may be necessary - I wrote it six 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>years ago and had no time to 
<br/>revise - One form of the verb 
<br/>for instance, I have not <span class="del cancelled">in</span> put in

<br/>My aim was to shew the simplicity
