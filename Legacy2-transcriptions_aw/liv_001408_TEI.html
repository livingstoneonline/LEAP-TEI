<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">              </span>Presuming that His 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Excellency the Governor has gone to 
<br/><span class="">England</span>, I enclose a copy of the <span class="">Lord's 
<br/>prayer</span> and <span class="">Creed</span> to you - they are 
<br/>as nearly as we can ascertain 
<br/>what the <span class="">jesuits</span> taught here more 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>than a hundred years ago - some old 
<br/>blind women were the depositories 
<br/>and <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">words</span> were taken down at their 
<br/>dictation by <span class="">S<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Candido</span> &amp; <span class="">Pascoal</span>
<br/>who know the dialect of <span class="">Tette</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>thoroughly - <span class="">Major Secard</span> with 
<br/>his usual kindness did all he 
<br/>could to secure correctness. So 
<br/>I think that remembering the 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>difficulty of getting ladies who had 
<br/>always sung them to speak slowly, 
<br/>you must reward us by placing 
<br/>the <span class="">documents</span> in some little nook 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of the "Library" till you get better.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As I never answered your kind 
<br/>note when about to leave the <span class="">Cape</span>
<br/>I may now do it so far by giving 
<br/>you a few remarks on the term. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Ba<span class="add  above">e</span>tsuana, for that if I mistake 
<br/>not is the way you (mis)spell it. 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Moffat's">Moffats</span></span> idea is probably the 
<br/>right one, but as a philologist you 
<br/>may like to hear why some minds 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>prefer the meaning of "likeness or 
<br/>equality"</p>
<br/><p class="p ">When sex is spoken of in connection 
<br/>with colour the diminutive form 
<br/>is invariably applied - thus khoma 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>e tseu = a  white ox - i.e. altogether white 
<br/>khomu e tsūana = a white cow - not 
<br/>a little but entirely white. Khomu e 
<br/>entsu = a black ox - Khomu e 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>tsuána a black cow = quite black. 
<br/>K. e khueba = a speckled ox. K. e 
<br/>khuebana a speckled cow - the 
<br/>idea of littleness seems to go to denote 
<br/>sex by the lesser size of the females - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the males being <span class="del cancelled">sometimes</span> denoted 
<br/>by tóna big - in the same way.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">This point is not adverted to 
<br/>in the Analysis but it is so distinctly 
<br/>adhered to in the language that an 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>additional syllable is introduced 
<br/>to express a little of any colour, thus 
<br/>Mosheu = a white man - Mosheu-
<br/>-enyana = a little white man - 
<br/>Montsu = a black one = Montsun-

<br/><span class="">Sebituane</span>'s daughters is called <span class="">Montsuyane</span>
<br/>from her colour being as light as an 
<br/><span class="">Arab</span> woman's - i.e. only a little black.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Were it not for the cow difficulty the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>term Batsuána would be better translated 
<br/>a "little black" instead of a little white - 
<br/>they were a little blacker than the <span class="">bushmen</span> 
<br/>&amp; <span class="">Hottentots</span> - they had intercourse with them 
<br/>but having had none with the people 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>beyond the Desert, to say they are a little 
<br/>whiter than these people, is to reason 
<br/>from our own knowledge of what is 
<br/>only partially the case - the Batōka for 
<br/>instance, <span class="add  above">and Banyai</span> and other tribes being as light 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>as they are - The above is against - hear 
<br/>pro - in one sentence - A man was checked 
<br/>by <span class="">Sechele</span> for telling him some <span class="">heathen</span> story
<br/>He did not wish to hear it. "you are under 
<br/>the Southern people" said the man in a pet

<br/>a feminine term to himself his assertions 
<br/>of equality would have been <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: meaningless">meaningles</span> <span class="">D. Livingstone</span></p>
