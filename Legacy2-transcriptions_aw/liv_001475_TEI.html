<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                                      </span>We have found an 
<br/>opening in a direction we never expected 
<br/>for we find that this river really comes 
<br/>out of <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">the hitherto undiscovered <span class="del cancelled">Lake</span></span> <span class="">Nyassa</span> one of those Lakes 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>with which <span class="">Africa</span> is studded - We traced 
<br/>the <span class="">Shire</span> up to its point of departure 
<br/>in <span class="">14° 25' S.</span> Lat. and we found that 
<br/>there are only <span class="">33 miles</span> of cataracts above 
<br/>this point when the river becomes 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>placid again and continues so right 
<br/>into the Lake. From <span class=""><span class="">Kongone</span> Harbour</span>
<br/>to this (<span class="">Murchison's cataract</span>) we have 
<br/>at least a <span class="">two fathom</span> channel all the 
<br/>year for <span class="">Shire</span> never varies more 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>than <span class="">from 2 to 3 feet</span> between the dry 
<br/>and wet seasons - And the Lake itself 
<br/>never varies more, if so much, so it 
<br/>must be <span class="app" title="This passage can be read in alternate ways: large [or] huge">large</span>, and well fed. We could 
<br/>not explore it, because we had left 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Macgregor's Laird</span>'s precious punt in 
<br/>a sinking state - Funnel - Furnace 
<br/>Deck &amp; Bottom all went  done simultaneously 
<br/>after only 12 months wear -

<br/>Nor could we get any information as to 
<br/>"how far off its head lay." <span class="">Shirwa</span> or as its 
<br/>name is <span class="">Tamandua</span> is <span class="">ninety miles 
<br/>long</span> - <span class="">Shirwa</span> means great water only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and is applied to the sea - We have opened 
<br/>a cotton field of unknown extent and 
<br/>superior to the American inasmuch as 
<br/>there are no frosts to cut off the crop - 
<br/>and instead of the endless labour in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">America</span>, one sowing of Foreign seed 
<br/>already introduced by the <span class="">natives</span>, yields 
<br/>for three years. The land beyond the 
<br/>cataracts lies in three terraces - The <span class=""><span class="">Shire</span> 
<br/>valley</span> being the lower one is about 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">1200 feet high</span> - a second East of this &amp; 
<br/><span class="">three miles broad</span> is <span class="">over 2000</span> while 
<br/>a third still East &amp; <span class="">over twelve miles 
<br/>broad</span> is <span class="">upwards of 3000 feet</span> at its 
<br/>Western edge, or about equal to your 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Table mountain</span> - On this terrace rises 
<br/><span class="">Mount Zomba</span> which in round numbers 
<br/>maybe called <span class="">between 7000 &amp; 8000 feet
<br/>high</span> - Our encampment on its southern 
<br/>edge was <span class="">nearly 7000</span> and <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in botanizing ascended the S.W. peak 
<br/><span class="">about a mile distant</span> and found it 
<br/>some <span class="">400 or 500</span> above the camp -
<br/>We travelled <span class="weather ">in the hottest season of the year</span> 
<br/>that called in <span class="">west <span class="">Africa</span></span> "the smokes" 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>when from the burning of immense tracts 
<br/>of country covered with tall grass the 
<br/>atmosphere is a thick haze all around - 
<br/><span class="weather ">It was very hot in the valley but when 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>we ascended to the second terrace the 
<br/>air was refreshing - And on the third it 
<br/>was delightful while on <span class="">Zomba</span> it 
<br/>was cold</span> - The terraces are wonderfully 
<br/>well supplied with running rills of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>deliciously cool water, and cotton is grown 
<br/>very extensively every where - On <span class="">Zomba</span>
<br/>itself there is a large valley with a fine 
<br/>stream and much cultivation though not 
<br/>of cotton - I mention these peculiarities 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>in the physical conformation of the 
<br/>country that you may <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: perceive">percieve</span> <span class="weather ">we 
<br/>have changes of climate within <span class="">a few 
<br/>miles</span> of each other</span>. These, for keeping 
<br/>people well, and I think one of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>greatest benefits this <span class="">Expedition</span> will 
<br/>confer is the speedy cure of fever even 
<br/>in the lowlands without, in general, 
<br/>loss of strength to the patient - The land 
<br/>beyond <span class="">Zomba</span> contracts between <span class="">Shire</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>and <span class="">Nyassa</span> or <span class="">Nyinyesi</span> into a narrow 
<br/>isthmus, and the trade from the <span class="">Interior</span> 
<br/>passes along this isthmus - We met a

<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">a</span> large <span class=""><span class="">East coast</span> <span class="">slaving</span> party</span> with an

<br/>tusks - We bought some fine specimens 
<br/>of Malachite from them which they had

<br/>that is saying a great deal seeing I lived 
<br/>long beyond the colony - They seemed to 
<br/>get into a panic when they knew we were 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>English for by night they evaporated - Probably 
<br/>they had the same opinion of us as we had 
<br/>of them -</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="underline ">Confidential</span> All the trade for a large tract 
<br/>of <span class="">East Coast</span> passes along the Isthmus and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>we propose an English station there, but 
<br/>the Portuguese would be up in arms did 
<br/>they know. We could with ease cut off 
<br/>much of the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> for <span class="">Mosambique</span> 
<br/>the <span class="">Augoxia river</span> &amp; other ports and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a plan is sent home to <span class="">Government</span> 
<br/>for the purpose. A common road 
<br/>could with ease be made past the cataracts
<br/>and a steamer placed on the Lake - not 
<br/>a <span class="">Macgregor Laird</span>'s sham but a good 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>one screwed together at home in a work-
<br/>manlike manner - We must have English 
<br/>colonization - I have no doubt as to 
<br/>its success had we a man like you
