<br/><p class="p center"><span class="space">                                  </span><span class="">4 April 1861</span>.</p>
<br/>
<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">    </span>My Dear Sir George</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">                          </span>You will probably have 
<br/>heard ere this reaches you that we went 
<br/>to the <span class="">Rovuma</span> in <span class="">February</span> and made 
<br/>an attempt to ascend that river in <span class="">March</span>. 
<br/>Our progress was arrested when only some 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">thirty miles</span> from the mouth by observing 
<br/>that the water was falling at the rate of <span class="">seven 
<br/>inches</span> a day; we had come over some 
<br/>parts not more than <span class="">five or six feet deep</span> 
<br/>and our vessel was drawing <span class="">four &amp; a half 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>feet</span> so we had to make up our minds 
<br/>whether to proceed further and remain among 
<br/>a people whom we do not know till next 
<br/>flood, or come back and work on our 
<br/>old "spoor" up the <span class="">Shire</span> - The detention 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>would have been such a waste of time 
<br/>for those who remained at <span class="">Johanna</span>, &amp; 
<br/>would not have advanced the objects 
<br/>of those who had come to <span class="">Rovuma</span> more 
<br/>effectually than by spending the same 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>period up the <span class="">Shire</span> = For the general 
<br/>good therefore we returned and were 
<br/>favoured by a rise in the river of 
<br/><span class="">three or four feet</span> - this last is said 
<br/>to be the last flood of the year, And 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>made us fully alive to the fact that 
<br/>from one cause or another we were 
<br/>quite two months too late for successful 
<br/>exploration.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">From the little that we saw we are 
<br/>disposed to think favourably of the river 
<br/>as an entrance into <span class="">Eastern <span class="">Africa</span></span> - It 
<br/>has a sandy bottom <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above"><span class="">three quarters of a mile broad</span></span> and partakes much 
<br/>of the character of the <span class="">Zambesi</span> - Unlike 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that river with its abominable bars, 
<br/>it flows into a magnificent bay - and 
<br/>the only danger in its <span class="">mile wide</span> mouth 
<br/>is a sort of "bore" formed by the 
<br/>water of the river of <span class="">a few fathoms</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>meeting the ocean tide of <span class="">nineteen fathoms</span>. 
<br/>At full tide it is all smooth - By keeping 
<br/>near the shore it is quite safe at all 
<br/>periods of the tide - We have a very 
<br/>short delta and the land rises up from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the banks in a gentle slope to <span class="">300 or 400 
<br/>feet</span> - It is well wooded the ebony 
<br/>attaining a much larger size than it 
<br/>does anywhere on the <span class="">Zambesi</span> - The 
<br/>country is very beautiful but there is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>something wrong among the people - 
<br/>Food seemed scarce in a soil where 
<br/>everything could grow - <span class="">Half caste <span class="">Arabs</span></span> 
<br/>appear to lord it over the general population 
<br/>and they were inclined to do the same 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>with us. When my brother took the Makololo 
<br/>on shore to cut wood some of them came 
<br/>and assumed the airs we read of in 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">in</span> countries further <span class="">North</span>. They demanded 
<br/>payment for the wood and he offered to 
<br/>give it provided that they should cut it. 
<br/>But no, they would seize that already cut, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the Makololo were unarmed but made 
<br/>a rush to their arms - "They would not 
<br/>let their <span class="">white men</span> be imposed on" the 
<br/>bastards made a rush the other way, 
<br/>and could scarcely be prevailed on to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>come back and take up the vegetables 
<br/>they had left behind - But for this little 
<br/>shew of pluck we should have had the 
<br/>company of these <span class="">half castes</span> at every 
<br/>village - fines levied on every possible 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>pretext - and the word passed on beyond 
<br/>their beat, that we were a <span class="">herd of she asses</span> 
<br/>to be milked for the public benefit - It is 
<br/>of the utmost importance here, as in <span class="">Europe</span> 
<br/>for the people to feel that you are not dependant 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>on them - If they see that you can get on 
<br/>without them they are much more obliging 
<br/>You could not have done a wiser deed 
<br/>than give my friend <span class="">Captain Speke</span> the 
<br/><span class="">Hottentot</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: guard">gaurd</span> - If they <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">continue stead fast and</span> escape fever, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>which is rather doubtful as <span class="">people of colour</span> 
<br/>are as liable to it as <span class="">whites</span>, his opinion 
<br/>of the general population will be raised 
<br/>about 300 per cent - I have always 
<br/>found that the presence of a trusty <span class="">band 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of Makololo</span> - though useless for ship 
<br/>work, was invaluable on land - It 
<br/>was not without considerable regret 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>that we gave up the project of a land 
<br/>journey with them up the <span class="">Rovuma</span>. 
<br/>It was the worst season for travelling - 
<br/><span class="weather ">rain, and heavy dews would have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>cut us up</span>. In fact the same reasons 
<br/>that prevailed for the postponement 
<br/>of the landing of the <span class="">Mission</span> still con-
<br/>-tinued in force - By the time we reach 
<br/>the <span class="">Shire</span> we shall be in the healthier 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>season, and a beginning will be made 
<br/>of the general labours from the other 
<br/>end of <span class="">Nyassa</span> to that which we looked 
<br/>on by the <span class="">Rovuma</span> - It is curious 
<br/>that all the people declare that <span class="del cancelled">Ny</span> <span class="">Rovuma</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>comes out of <span class="">Nyassa</span> - This, according to 
<br/>a curious idea that has come over the 
<br/>geographical mind in <span class="">England</span>, must 
<br/>mean that <span class="">Nyassa</span> comes out <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">of</span> <span class="">Rovuma</span>
<br/>I wish our good friends would only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>tell us all about it beforehand - It would 
<br/>save us a great deal of trouble - and 
<br/>deliver us from the perplexity of guessing 
<br/>and - grumbling - We see for instance 
<br/><span class="">Shire</span> never discolours in flood - but is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>always of a dark mossy hue = carries 
<br/>a great deal of mica, <span class="add  above">has a muddy bottom</span> and never rises 
<br/>or falls more than <span class="">a few feet</span> - <span class="">Rovuma</span> 
<br/>rises some <span class="">five or six feet</span> - is very brown 
<br/>&amp; muddy, but has a sandy bottom - water 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>carries little or no mica - and tastes of 
<br/>rain rather than moss. Now anything positive 
<br/>if given beforehand will be thankfully <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>
<br/>though it comes from the <span class="">Archives of <span class="">Prester John</span></span></p>

<br/>If they become sick there they had

<br/>she has come down to carrying 

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>

<br/>on board bought at <span class="">Kilwa</span> (<span class="">Quiloa</span>) on 
<br/>the <span class="">East Coast</span> at 22 dollars per head 
<br/>then - the owner gave 250 dollars to

<br/>him with certificate that the <span class="">slaves</span> 
<br/>were his own people lent as <span class="">free

<br/>necessary to conceal the nature of these 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>transactions - there is constant intercourse 
<br/>between the islands &amp; the chief is rather 
<br/>admired for the amount he extracted, 
<br/>but the <span class="">French Government</span> Official 
<br/>is on board and it is illegal to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>touch her - What did the <span class="">Emperor</span>
