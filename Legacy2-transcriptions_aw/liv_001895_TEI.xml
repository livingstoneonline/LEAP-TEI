<lb/><p>Dear Sir George</p> <!-- persName: Sir George Grey -->
<lb/><p><space extent="13" unit="chars"/>We have been very much 
<lb/>baffled in our work since you left and our 
<lb/>prospects now are far from bright - We are 
<lb/>engaged in the transport of the steamer "the 
<lb/>Lady of the Lake" past <placeName><geogName type="cataract">Murchison's cataracts</geogName></placeName> <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>and while hoping to do something effectual 
<lb/>towards stopping a <orgName>stream of <orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> of above 
<lb/><choice><sic>20 000</sic><corr>20,000</corr></choice> annually that passes from the 
<lb/>Lake region towards <placeName><settlement type="town">Quiloa</settlement></placeName> - the <placeName><geogName type="sea">Red Sea</geogName></placeName> and <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="sea">Persian Gulph</geogName></placeName>, we look back ruefully 
<lb/>on the doings of the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> behind us - 
<lb/>It is but lately that I have come to understand 
<lb/>their system - because during the past 
<lb/>few years the <term type="nationality">French</term> <orgName>slave</orgName> emigration was 
<lb/>chiefly supplied by raids to the <placeName><region>North</region></placeName> of <placeName><settlement type="town">Quillimane</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and we saw but little of it - the valley of 
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> had previously been depopulated. 
<lb/>Last year however the <orgName><placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> people</orgName> followed 
<lb/>on our spoor - supplied one tribe with guns 
<lb/>and ammunition to be paid in <orgName>slaves</orgName> - 
<lb/>The tribe attacked fled to the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> - famine 
<lb/>succeeded and we saw as we ascended 
<lb/>many dead bodies floating past the victims 
<lb/>of famine and slave hunting - Another person 
<lb/>engaged in <orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> <term type="occupation">hunting</term></orgName> in the country 
<lb/>adjacent to <placeName><geogName type="mountain">Mount Clarendon</geogName></placeName> - He is a <orgName>half 
<lb/>caste</orgName> and is said to possess a thousand 
<lb/>armed <orgName>slaves</orgName> - flight to the river and famine 
<lb/>have done their work lower down than 
<lb/>where the <orgName><placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> people</orgName> have acted - Two others 
<lb/>have set up <orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> <term type="occupation">hunting</term></orgName> on their own 
<lb/>responsibility and the authorities never 
<lb/>interfere until the marauder has accumulated 
<lb/>spoil enough to make him worth squeezing</p>
<lb/>
	<cb rend="vertical"/>
<lb/><ab>The <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> fled down to <placeName><region><persName>Chibisa</persName>'s</region></placeName> &amp; are "as well as could be expected"</ab>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001895_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">This system going on with the connivance of 
<lb/>the <orgName>Governors</orgName> - We caught some of the 
<lb/><term type="occupation">Governor</term> of <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName>'s own <orgName>slaves</orgName> at it - It seems
<lb/>evident that the good effects expected from 
<lb/>the operations of the <choice><orig>cruizers</orig><reg>cruisers</reg></choice> cannot be 
<lb/>realized - In the <placeName><region>West</region></placeName> great success has 
<lb/>attended their efforts in the way the promoters 
<lb/>of the suppression policy intended - the 
<lb/><orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> trade</orgName> was repressed for a time to allow 
<lb/>the influences of <term type="faith">Christianity</term> to extend inland
<lb/>At least 20 <orgName>missions</orgName> have been established 
<lb/>an equal number of dialects have been 
<lb/>reduced to writing - thousands are educated 
<lb/>about <choice><sic>12 000</sic><corr>12,000</corr></choice> communicants are members 
<lb/>of the different churches, and lawful trade 
<lb/>has extended from <choice><sic>£20 000</sic><corr>£20,000</corr></choice> annually to 
<lb/>between £2,000,000 and <choice><sic>£3 000 000</sic><corr>£3,000,000</corr></choice> - Indeed 
<lb/>a greater amount of tonnage is now 
<lb/>engaged in legal trade than was formerly 
<lb/>employed in that in <orgName>slaves</orgName> - But on this 
<lb/>coast it is still the old system of paltry 
<lb/>peddling in ivory and gold dust and <orgName>slaving</orgName> 
<lb/>as often as there is opportunity - If none 
<lb/>but a few convict <term type="people">Portuguese</term> had been 
<lb/>allowed to enter the <placeName><region>West</region></placeName> the same results 
<lb/>would have followed as here - and 
<lb/>unless the navigation of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> &amp; 
<lb/><choice><sic>and</sic><corr/></choice> <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> is made free to all nations 
<lb/>I doubt whether we can effect much 
<lb/>When the passions of these <orgName>Africans</orgName> are 
<lb/>enlisted on the side of wrong the case is 
<lb/>difficult - Fortunately we have in <persName>Earl 
<lb/>Russell</persName> a man who will do all that 
<lb/>can be done to promote freedom of both 
<lb/>black and white - and in <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName> 
<lb/>who is <choice><sic>pre eminently</sic><corr>pre-eminently</corr></choice> the <term type="occupation">author</term> of the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001895_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr/></choice> suppression policy we have one who 
<lb/>has done more <w><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/><supplied cert="medium">for</supplied></w> the good of <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> 
<lb/>than any one who can be mentioned
<lb/>Being under him one cannot speak out 
<lb/>all that is felt in reviewing his long &amp; 
<lb/>unwearied labours for the abolition of 
<lb/>the <orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> trade</orgName> - without appearing to be a 
<lb/>toady and that does not lie in my 
<lb/>line - I hope that something may be done 
<lb/>and think the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> might yield it 
<lb/>as they never use the mouths of the 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> or <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> at all -</p>
<lb/><p>The death of <persName>bishop Mackenzie</persName> was a 
<lb/>great misfortune as it created <del type="strikethrough">as</del> a 
<lb/>prejudice - and half of the exposure <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName></add> he 
<lb/>subjected himself to would have led to 
<lb/>his being quickly cut off by <term type="ailment">consumption</term>
<lb/>We have had our losses too from being 
<lb/>compelled to delay a long time in a most 
<lb/>unhealthy locality - but these cases 
<lb/>are accidental - We have the prospect 
<lb/>of half a dozen <orgName><term type="nationality">Scotch</term> <term type="occupation">mechanics</term></orgName> joining 
<lb/>us soon - They worked at their trades 
<lb/>in <placeName>Aliwal North</placeName> and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Burnet</persName> the 
<lb/><term type="occupation">commissioner</term> gives a good report 
<lb/>of them - Their wages went to a common 
<lb/>fund out of which <choice><orig>waggons</orig><reg>wagons</reg></choice> were bought 
<lb/>and they were ready to proceed overland 
<lb/>when the <term type="occupation">Governor</term> asked me if they 
<lb/>might not rather be sent by sea - They 
<lb/>seem just the men we want and 
<lb/>I have recommended them to try 
<lb/>and set an example of independent 
<lb/>industry and <term type="faith">Christian</term> life before 
<lb/>the inhabitants of the Lake - <!-- geog: Nyassa --></p>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001895_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/><p>We went up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> about 
<lb/><measure>156 miles or 114 as the <term type="animal">crow</term> flies</measure> during 
<lb/><date when="1862-09">September</date> &amp; <date when="1862-10">October</date> last - People near the 
<lb/>coast unfriendly but further inland 
<lb/>all we could expect - the lands on each 
<lb/>bank rise up <measure>400 or 500 feet</measure> - the edge 
<lb/>of a plateau though they look like ranges 
<lb/>of hills - the country <choice><sic>well wooded</sic><corr>well-wooded</corr></choice> &amp; 
<lb/>fertile - pieces of coal seen in the sands 
<lb/>but <term type="insect">tsetse</term> prevails - the river takes 
<lb/>us twice on to the <orgName>slave</orgName> route from 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> to <placeName><settlement type="town">Quiloa</settlement></placeName> - we turned at some 
<lb/>low rapids about <measure>eleven <orgName>Arab</orgName> days</measure> 
<lb/>from <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> - <measure>One day above our 
<lb/>turning point</measure> the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> is joined 
<lb/>by the <placeName><geogName type="river">Liendi</geogName></placeName> which rises on the mountains 
<lb/><placeName><region>East of the Lake</region></placeName>. <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> is still said <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>to come out of it as formerly but the 
<lb/>passage is narrow and down rocks 
<lb/>this will be our outlet rather than pay 
<lb/>dues to <term type="people">Portuguese</term> but it is hard to 
<lb/>leave the route we opened &amp; rendered 
<lb/>safe to vile <orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> <term type="occupation">hunters</term></orgName> -</p>
<lb/><p>I am glad to hear from our Friend 
<lb/><persName>Maclear</persName> that you are succeeding in 
<lb/>your labours - You have our heartiest 
<lb/>good wishes - If you still wish to do
