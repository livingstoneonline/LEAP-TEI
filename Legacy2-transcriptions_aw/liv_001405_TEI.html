<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                </span>In my last I told 
<br/>you of our visit to <span class="">Kebra basa</span>
<br/>and I am happy now to be able 
<br/>to inform you that it has been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>visited again since the water 
<br/>began to rise and the reports 
<br/>of <span class="">M<span class="sup "><span class="underline ">r</span></span> C. Livingstone</span> and <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>Baines</span> fully confirm what 
<br/>I advanced as to effect of a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>flood. Several of the cataracts 
<br/>which at low water seemed 
<br/>very serious obstacles are 
<br/>rendered so smooth that but 
<br/>for the adjacent mountains 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>having been sketched they 
<br/>would not have been recognized</p> 

<p class="ab ">
<br/>A <span class="">Rev<span class="sup underline ">d</span> D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Russel</span> of <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low"><span class="">Maynooth</span></span> College gave me a <span class="">Bunda</span> poem

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p noindent">but a steamer capable of stemming 
<br/>the main current is necessary for 
<br/>the ascent. The river is now <span class="">15 feet</span> 
<br/>above low water mark in November 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and as it is expected to rise considerably 
<br/>more I felt inclined to take advantage 
<br/>of it and haul this vessel through 
<br/>but besides the risk of doubling her 
<br/>up she can carry so little cargo 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>we would soon be without 
<br/>supplies after we had succeeded. 
<br/>We shall therefore work for a while 
<br/>on this side the rapid - and as a 
<br/>beginning I may mention that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>we went up the <span class="">Shire</span> about the 
<br/>beginning of <span class="">January</span> and found 
<br/>it a good navigable river for 
<br/>at least <span class="">one hundred miles</span> from 
<br/>its confluence - The Mountain 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Morambala</span> is <span class="">4000 ft high</span> and 
<br/>has a wonderfully <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: well-cultivated">well cultivated</span> 
<br/>large top - Lemon trees grow quite 
<br/>wild in the woods &amp; so do oranges 
<br/>&amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: pineapples">pine apples</span>. There are several 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>fine little fountains with water slightly 
<br/>chalybeate - the people independent &amp; 
<br/>very hospitable. The view from the 
<br/>top of the <span class="">Shire</span> winding across an 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>extended plain inhabited by real 
<br/><span class="">Lotophagi</span> is magnificent and 
<br/>as you may judge from the 
<br/>height we have <span class="weather ">quite a different 
<br/>climate from that of the plains</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>The vegetation is very like that 
<br/>of <span class="">Londa</span> &amp; <span class="">Angola</span> - We have 
<br/>also a fine hot sulphureous 
<br/>fountain at the base (174°) yet 
<br/>no advantage has been taken of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>this splendid sanatorium by the 
<br/>Portguese - The valley of the <span class="">Shire</span>
<br/>at one part abounds in Elephants 
<br/>and if you come to see us 
<br/>about January I undertake to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="add  marginleft"> [shew] </span> five hundred of these noble 
<br/>animals grazing on one plain
<br/>We saw more than that - and as 
<br/>there are branches of the river which 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>form islands we sometimes chased 
<br/>them with this vessel. They had 
<br/>magnificent tusks - I think that they 
<br/>are attracted down from the hills by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the sweet fruit of wild Palmyras of 
<br/>which there are fine forests there. 
<br/>The people were very suspicious 
<br/>of us never having been visited 
<br/>by <span class="">Europeans</span> before but treated 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>us civilly. Our wooding <span class="">parties</span> 
<br/>were never molested - yet a 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: guard">gaurd</span> was set over us both night 
<br/>and day. They are <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: well-armed">well armed</span>
<br/>with bows and poisoned 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>arrows. The women insert an 
<br/>ornament exactly the size and 
<br/>shape of the rings for table napkins 
<br/>into the upper lip - the effect 
<br/>is frightful - It is a most unaccountable 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>ornament. They cultivate largely on 
<br/>the upper third of the <span class="">Shire</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: valley">vally</span>
<br/>and we purchased abundance of 
<br/>provisions at a cheap rate besides 
<br/>specimens of their cotton &amp; cotton yarn

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>They have two kinds of cotton <span class="add blue above">GL:L30(4)</span> and 
<br/>both very good in quality.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our first object was to 
<br/>gain their confidence and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>seeing them so suspicious, 
<br/>though we had pretty certain 
<br/>information of the <span class="">Shire</span>
<br/>becoming smooth again 
<br/>beyond the cataract which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>stopped our progress and 
<br/>that <span class="">Arabs</span> from <span class="">Zanzibar</span>
<br/>were in the habit of coming 
<br/>down in canoes from 
<br/><span class="">Lake Nyanja</span> we thought 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>it imprudent to leave the 
<br/>vessel in their power 
<br/>and go overland. We leave 
<br/>them to allow our first 
<br/>visit to have its effect 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>and in the course of a 
<br/>month return to them again</p>

<p class="ab ">
<br/>I have got a portion of the Lord's prayer - &amp; <span class="">Ave Maria</span> from an 
<br/>old blind woman. Another old lady here remembers the two black 
<br/>traders coming here from <span class="">Angola</span> on whom the Portuguese lay their claims 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>for having crossed the continent - they never went to the coast so she says</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/><p class="p noindent">The reason why the Portuguese 
<br/>have not gone farther up than 
<br/>about <span class="">Morambala</span> is probably 
<br/>the steady rapidity of the current 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>(<span class="">2½ knots</span>) there are no still 
<br/>reaches and with the heavy <span class="">Zambesi</span> 
<br/>canoes it is difficult to get on 
<br/>in a current. The people too 
<br/>have a bad name - they are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>said to have killed some <span class=""><span class="">native</span> 
<br/>traders</span>. In <span class="">1856</span> when I was 
<br/>coming down past the mouth 
<br/>of the <span class="">Shire</span> I was told that an 
<br/><span class="">expedition</span> had been sent up 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>but was unable to go far because 
<br/>the river was blocked up with 
<br/>duckweed - quantities of that were 
<br/>then coming out of the river 
<br/>but at <span class="">25 miles</span> from the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>confluence the duckweed ceases 
<br/>so the <span class="">Expedition</span> could not have 
<br/><span class="space">                                        </span>gone far

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>Above that the river widens a 
<br/>little but it is free from sand banks 
<br/>and deep. Indeed it may be said 
<br/>to be superior to the <span class="">Zambesi</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for steam navigation. We could 
<br/>go on at night even.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">This is our most unhealthy 
<br/>season. Fever is fatal on 
<br/>the coast. Here we have some 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of it but no one dies in 
<br/>consequence. Three of our 
<br/><span class="">party</span> have had touches of it 
<br/>but are better. This is the 
<br/>edge of the high healthy lands 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>where I have still every reason 
<br/>to believe that <span class="">Europeans</span> 
<br/>might live in safety. We are 
<br/>longing somewhat for news 
<br/>having <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> none 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>except the <span class="">papers</span> you were 
<br/>kind enough to send us by 
<br/>the Lynx.</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/><p class="p ">I have litle hopes of doing any good 
<br/>with the people under or in contact with 
<br/>the Portuguese - A year or more must 
<br/>elapse ere they recover from the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>effects of their late war - but I think 
<br/>more highly of the capabilities of the 
<br/>country for the produce <span class="">England</span> 
<br/>stands most in need of than ever
<br/>I could collect a waggon load or two 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of Indigo from the streets of <span class="">Tette</span>
<br/><span class="">tomorrow</span> - <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> made some 
<br/>with it and cotton though burned 
<br/>down annually springs up <span class="del cancelled">annually</span>
<br/>as brisk as ever - The people here 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>make sugar, of this I was not aware 
<br/>before. We have put up our little 
<br/>engine to shew what machinery 
<br/>can do: her first work was to saw 
<br/>up planks to make a boat - which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Major Secard</span> our best friend was 
<br/>about to build. We try sugar <span class="add  above">cane</span> as soon 
<br/>as it is ready to cut</p>
