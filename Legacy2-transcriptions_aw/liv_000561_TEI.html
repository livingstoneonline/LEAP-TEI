<br/><p class="p ">My Dear Friends</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                                </span><span class="space">      </span>I sent off three <span class="">letters</span> for you about three 
<br/>months ago and when I was in a sadly distressed state on account of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>having suffered hurt in the jaws of a lion. About the time we 
<br/>came here we were surrounded by an unusual number of lions 
<br/>Many were killed but attacks continued to be made daily and the <span class="">natives</span> 
<br/>were beginning to lose heart, and no sooner was it made known 
<br/>that cattle had been killed during the night than all our work at the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>water course was immediately suspended; Feeling vexed with these 
<br/>misfortunes on one occasion when a lion killed 9 sheep on a 
<br/>hill opposite our house I contrary to my usual custom went 
<br/>with them in order to encourage them to put him to death and I 
<br/>paid dearly for it for the lion on being wounded rushed down 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>upon and bit three of us badly, mine was worst for he broke 
<br/>the left arm bone in several places &amp; twelve large gashes were 
<br/>made some of them reaching down to the fractures. <span class="">Mebaloe</span>
<br/>our <span class="">native</span> assistant ran forward to rescue me but his gun 
miss-<br/>-ed fire and he got severely wounded in the thigh. The lion then attacked 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a makhatla &amp; bit his shoulder but this was his last deed of 
<br/>mischief for in doing so another makhatla pitched a spear 
<br/>into the monster's heart. <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s wounds healed in about 
<br/>a month after their infliction but mine were three before I could 
<br/>use the arm in the least. I had a long trial of patience. Our 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>hut being quite unfinished the <span class="">natives</span> built me a hut and 
<br/>in that hut I had many a wearisome day &amp; night - the wounds 
<br/>discharged so excessively I was reduced to a mere skeleton and 
<br/>had not strength to make the least movement on any couch 
<br/>and not being able to secure the bones myself every motion 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of the body caused them to grate on each other so as to prevent 
<br/>union &amp; retard the healing of the wounds But through great
<br/>mercy I have recovered well beyond my utmost expectation &amp; 
<br/>my arm is both straight &amp; firm. It was a great affliction 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>But the Lord mingled much kindness with its severity and now 
<br/>I can only praise him for his goodness &amp; sparing mercy. May 
<br/>the spared life be devoted to the glory of my great Deliverer
<br/>the Bakhatla are at present erecting new villages on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the site of the <span class="">mission</span> and we shall commence the erection 
<br/>of a school immediately in order to have the power of 
<br/>collecting both children &amp; adults in all weathers. We have 
<br/>nothing of interest to relate respecting them. It is only midnight 
<br/>gloom in their minds their affections are all on the earth 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>&amp; a thought never glances heavenward. But notwithstanding 
<br/>their selfishness which is supreme I begin to love them more 
<br/>than ever. I soon forgot to think of them as of a different 
<br/>complexion and feel towards them as fellow immortals who 
<br/>if they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> soon accept mercy must be lost eternally &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>O that they would but listen to the glad tidings. It would 
<br/>satisfy them more thoroughly than all the world of goods. 
<br/>We hear that the Lord is blessing his word at <span class="">Lattakoo</span>
<br/>twentythree were lately added to the church. I wish we could 
<br/>say we saw even three beginning to think about their 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>souls &amp; eternity. they are degraded beyond conception 
<br/>they seem to have sunk as far as human nature can - 
<br/>there seem to exist some evidences of animal worship at 
<br/>some former periods, as they are all called by some animal 
<br/>thus for instance <span class="del cancelled">the</span> Batlapi literally translated is <span class="underline ">they</span> (of the) 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="underline ">Fish</span>, Bakwain <span class="underline ">they</span> (of the) <span class="underline ">Crocodile</span>, Bakhatla <span class="underline ">they</span> of 
<br/>the <span class="underline ">monkey</span>, Bachuéne, they of the Baboon. While 
<br/>the Barolongs if asked by what they swear invariably 
<br/>answer "we dance to iron". And in hunting if they happen 
<br/>to kill a khoodoo a magnificent animal of the antelope 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>species always make loud lamentations before they 
<br/>begin to <span class="del cancelled"><span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">skin</span></span> flay it as "yo yo yo we have killed our Father 
<br/>yo yo yo &amp;c &amp;c, believing if they neglect this some of their 
<br/>number will die in consequence. All the other tribes swear 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>by the animal after which they are called, never kill or eat 
<br/>it &amp; sometimes <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> even look at it, saying that animal 
<br/>is the friend of their race But if I am not wrong in my 
<br/>conjecture even this form of worship has degenerated so 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>that now only the vestiges remain &amp; all their affections are 
<br/>given to the gratification of earthly propensities O that the 
<br/>Holy spirit may work mightily on these dark minds &amp; turn 
<br/>them from the service of their lusts to the pure service of 
<br/>the Great God of Heaven &amp; of earth</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">Of all the seeds you gave me none vegetated except the 
sun-<br/>flower and now it is planted at <span class="">Mabotsa</span>, the reason of the 
<br/>deficiency of vegetative power I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know perhaps it was 
<br/>sea air that destroyed it. I long much for an opportunity 
<br/>to send you a box, but all my endeavours have as yet been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>in vain. We have chinese oats without <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">any</span> husk and 
<br/>Egyptian corn (a few grains of it were once shewn 
<br/>me by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Pyne</span> grows well. It being better adapted 
<br/>for boiling than the <span class="">Bengal</span> corn we have it <span class="del cancelled">planted</span> sown 
<br/>yearly. there are other things which might be of use if I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>could only get them sent. I shall however still be 
<br/>on the look out &amp; hope I shall yet succeed.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Hoping soon to hear from you I shall conclude this 
<br/>short <span class="">letter</span> with very affectionate regards to all your
