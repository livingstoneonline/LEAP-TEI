<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">                      </span>We are obliged to 
<br/>dismiss two of our members, 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Thornton</span> the geologist 
<br/>for whom I am sorry as he 
<br/>fails from sheer want of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>knowledge of the world and 
<br/>of field geology. We could 
<br/>not get him to work at all 
<br/>though he would read at 
<br/>geology for ever. He is very 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>well up in school geology but never 
<br/>shewed the least heart to working 
<br/>in the field - I gave him eight 
<br/>months trial - and when I was out 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of sight nothing was done - He 
<br/>trusts to get on by dint of 
<br/>cleverness at home - not knowing 
<br/>how difficult it is to climb - 
<br/>We tried all that talking could do 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span>, My brother &amp; myself, 
<br/>but it was impossible to stir 
<br/>him up from a state of 
<br/>inveterate laziness.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We are obliged to send <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Baines</span> away too. He worked 
<br/>well but having had fever 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>I thought it kind to leave him at 
<br/><span class="">Tette</span> during the unhealthy months 
<br/>and not expose him to the lower 
<br/><span class="">Shire</span> whither with <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Kirk</span> I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>proceeded myself - As soon as 
<br/>my back was turned he 
<br/>associated with certain "ticket 
<br/>of leave" Portuguese and made 
<br/>away with nearly all our 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>provisions - four barrels of 
<br/>loaf sugar - butter - cheese 
<br/>hams - &amp;c &amp;c - I put it to his 
<br/>head having been affected 
<br/>by fever but he had stolen 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>from his fellow members 
<br/>private property - marked his

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>name on the articles, and while
<br/>giving or selling our provisions
<br/>took precious good care of all
<br/>he had appropriated and of his
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>own private - property, so I could
<br/>not give him the benefit of a 
<br/>doubt I previously held - He
<br/>confessed to some of his thefts -
<br/>With <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> C. Livingstone</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>&amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Rae</span> the <span class="">Expedition</span> is
<br/>more easily moved about
<br/>I could not send detached <span class="">parties</span>
<br/>out but had to go everywhere
<br/>myself and defection has
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>been the consequence - Were we
<br/>within jurisdiction of courts of
<br/>law I would certainly deliver
<br/><span class="">Baines</span> over to <span class="">Justice</span></p>
