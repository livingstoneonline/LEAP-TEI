<br/><p class="p noindent">being confined by mountains 
<br/>to a bed <span class="">¼ mile wide</span> at parts 
<br/>and at one point to <span class="">50 or 60 yards</span>
<br/>In the wider parts there is a deep 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>groove cut out of the solid rock 
<br/>if such it can be called where 
<br/>rocks are twisted - broken, cleaved 
<br/>&amp; huddled together in every direction 
<br/>besides being water worn and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>drilled with potholes everywhere
<br/>When sailing up the groove with 
<br/>the walls far above our masts 
<br/>the man at the lead kept calling 
<br/>out "no bottom at <span class="">ten fathoms</span>" 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>yet the groove fills at flood 
<br/>and flows over the adjacent 
<br/>bed though to do so it must 
<br/>rise perpendicularly <span class="">80 or 100 feet</span>
<br/>There are rapids in the groove 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>which this feeble vessel cannot 
<br/>stem but we have no doubt 
<br/>that a steamer of good power 
<br/>would go up easily at flood 
<br/>one rapid which had <span class="">five feet</span>

<br/>Ma Robert was just <span class="">1/16 of an inch 
<br/>thick</span> when new - is now thinner 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>so we fear to try towing 
<br/>her up lest she should go craunch 
<br/>like an old tin kettle in the operation
<br/>There is also a place with 
per-<br/>pendicular walls past which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>no towing line could be carried
<br/>The mountains are at least 
<br/><span class="">2000 or 2300 feet high</span> - covered 
<br/>with trees and very healthy
<br/>As far as the  can reach 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Northwards we see ranges of the 
<br/>same even into the blue 
<br/>distance. We slept without cover 
<br/>or quinine &amp; but for the toil 
<br/>which was excessive we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>should all have returned improved 
<br/>in health. It made us so 
<br/>lean that had I come down 
<br/>this way in <span class="">1856</span> I should have 
<br/>perished before reaching <span class="">Tette</span>. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>It is an impediment to 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>navigation i.e. canoe or bum - 
<br/>boat navigation - they cannot paddle 
<br/>against a four knot current and 
<br/>then here they cannot punt at <span class="">60 feet 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>deep</span> nor tow from a height of 
<br/><span class="">80 ft</span> so they go over land - We have 
<br/>abundance of work in the mean 
<br/>time down here - the geologist reports

<br/>It was fired by lightning a few years

<br/>are all in good health - Have had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>colds only, no fever except among 
<br/>the <span class="">Kroomen</span>. The Portuguese command 
<br/>ant <span class="">Major Secard</span> gave us the

<br/>to live in at <span class="">Tette</span>. I am going up

<br/><p class="p ">Thanks for the <span class="">pamphlet</span> containing 
<br/>the account of your library. I made 
<br/>a collection of Bechuana orations 
<br/>Maina or names they are called and

<br/>the circumcision. They contained a great
