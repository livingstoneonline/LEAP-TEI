<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space">                            </span>We returned a few days ago 
<br/>from a three <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: months'">months</span> tour on the <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span>
<br/>A boat was carried past <span class="">Murchison's cataracts</span> 
<br/>a distance of about <span class="">forty miles</span> - We then 
<br/>sailed <span class="">sixty more</span> before entering the Lake 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>which is <span class=""><span class="">over 200 miles in length</span> - It is 
<br/><span class="">from twenty to fifty or more miles broad</span></span>, 
<br/>and very very deep - According to our 
<br/>present experience a ship could find 
<br/>anchorage only near the shore, but she might 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>get a rock through her bottom a good way 
<br/>out besides - There are several rounded 
<br/>rocky islands covered with dense forest 
<br/>and uninhabited - Adjacent to these and 
<br/>also opposite all the rocky headlands 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>detached rocks jut out or are covered with 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">with</span> only <span class="">a few feet</span> of water - The Lake 
<br/>is surrounded by mountains or by 
<br/>high table lands that appear as such 
<br/>the Eastern are higher than the Western

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>A mountainous Cape which we named 
<br/><span class="">Cape Maclear</span> divides the <span class="">Southern end</span> 
<br/>into two bays <span class="">one 30 the other 18 miles 
<br/>in length</span> - The Lake has thus a forked 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>appearance there, and with the help of a 
<br/>little imagination somewhat of the boot 
<br/>shape of <span class="">Italy</span>. We went along the <span class="">Western 
<br/>shore</span> and found it a succession of 
<br/>bays until in the far <span class="">North</span> the spurs 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of the mountains running sheer down 
<br/>to the water scarcely afforded landing 
<br/>places - In the <span class="">south</span> while rounding <span class="">Cape 
<br/>Maclear</span> no bottom was felt with 
<br/>our sounding line of <span class="">35 fathoms</span> - In 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the <span class="">north</span> none was found with a fishing 
<br/>line of <span class="">696 feet</span> but it broke in coming 
<br/>up and was therefore unsatisfactory
<br/>We were there <span class="weather ">during the prevalence of the 
<br/>Equinoctial gales</span> and found that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>tremendous seas like those that play off 
<br/><span class="">Quillimane</span> rose in fifteen or twenty 
<br/>minutes - An <span class="">Arab</span> dhow lately built to 
<br/>carry <span class="">slaves</span> across fled from us twice 
<br/>to the <span class="">Eastern shore</span> - We could not cross 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>though at certain seasons the <span class="">natives</span> can 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>in their canoes. We never saw so many 
<br/>people anywhere else as on its shores and 
<br/><span class="">slaving</span> is the only trade - they were upon the 
<br/>whole very civil - We were objects of great 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>curiosity to them - no fines were levied 
<br/>nor dues demanded - Fish abound &amp; 
<br/>the people seem all fishermen catching with 
<br/>large trawling nets - creels - hooks, torches - 
<br/>or poison - One species resembles salmon 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>or trout in shape and goes up the rivers to 
<br/>spawn - It tastes somewhat like herring - 
<br/>Elephants and hippopotami very tame 
<br/>Alligators seldom kill men so we could 
<br/>bathe in the delicious cool waters when 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>we liked - When we passed <span class="">Lat. 11° 40' South</span> 
<br/>we were in the borders of a tribe of <span class="">zulus</span> 
<br/>called Mazite or Mazitu from the <span class="">South</span> 
<br/>(originally) - they live on the highlands <span class="">West 
<br/>of the North end of the Lake</span> - Very many 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>skeletons and putrid bodies of the slain 
<br/>were seen and the land was depopulated - 
<br/>We heard of course but one side of the 
<br/>story and could form no opinion as 
<br/>to the cause of this terrible slaughter - I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>met and had a short interview with 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>seven of these Mazite - they seemed as 
<br/>much afraid of me as I ought to have 
<br/>been of them - We saw some Mazite skulls 
<br/>on trees and remains of burned bodies so 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>they do not always come off unscathed
<br/>We returned about as wise as we went 
<br/>about the <span class="">Rovuma</span> - plenty of assertions 
<br/>but in nothing did all agree except that 
<br/>it is a very large river -</p>
