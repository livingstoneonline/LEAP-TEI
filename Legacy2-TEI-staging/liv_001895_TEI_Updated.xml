<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>River Shire</placeName> Feb<hi rend="sup">y</hi>1863 </p>
<lb/><p>Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>We have been very much 
<lb/>baffled in our work since you left and our 
<lb/>prospects now are far from bright. We are 
<lb/>engaged in the transport of the steamer "the lady of the Lake" past <placeName>Murchison's cataracts</placeName>
<lb/>and while hoping to do something effectual 
<lb/>towards stopping a stream of slaves of above 
<lb/>20000 annually that passes from the 
<lb/>Lake region towards <placeName>Quiloa</placeName> - <placeName>the Red Sea</placeName> and 
<lb/><placeName>Persian Gulph</placeName>, we look back ruefully 
<lb/>on the doings of the Portuguese behind us. 
<lb/>It is but lately that I have come to understand 
<lb/>their system - because during the past 
<lb/>few years the French slave <unclear cert="low">emigration</unclear> was 
<lb/>chiefly supplied by raids to the North of <placeName>Quillimane</placeName>
<lb/>and we saw but little of it, the valley of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> had previously been depopulated. 
<lb/>Last year however the <placeName>Tette</placeName> people followed 
<lb/>on our spoor - supplied one tribe with guns 
<lb/>and ammunition to be paid in slaves - 
<lb/>The tribe attacked fled to the <placeName>Shire</placeName> - famine 
<lb/>succeeded and we saw as we ascended 
<lb/>many dead bodies floating past the victims 
<lb/>of famine and slave hunting. Another person 
<lb/>engaged in slave hunting in the country 
<lb/>adjacent to <placeName>Mount Clarendon</placeName>. He is a half 
<lb/>caste and is said to possess a thousand 
<lb/>armed slaves - flight to the river and famine 
<lb/>have done their work lower down than 
<lb/>where the <placeName>Tette</placeName> people have acted. Two others 
<lb/>have set up slave hunting on their own 
<lb/>responsibility and the authorities never 
<lb/>interfere until the marauder has accumulated 
<lb/>spoil enough to make him worth squeezing<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001895_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>This system going on with the connivance of 
<lb/>the Governors. We caught some of the 
<lb/><persName>Governor of Tette's</persName> own slaves at it. It seems 
<lb/>evident that the good efforts expected from 
<lb/>the operations of the cruizers cannot be 
<lb/>realized. In the West great success has 
<lb/>attended their efforts in the way the promoters 
<lb/>of the suppression policy intended - the 
<lb/>slave trade was repressed for a time to allow 
<lb/>the influences of Christianity to extend inland<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>At least 20 missions have been established 
<lb/>an equal number of dialects have been 
<lb/>reduced to writing, thousands are educated 
<lb/>about 12000 communicants are members 
<lb/>of the different churches, and lawful trade 
<lb/>has extended from £20000 annually to 
<lb/>between £2,000,000 and £3000000. Indeed 
<lb/>a greater amount of tonnage is now 
<lb/>engaged in legal trade than was formerly 
<lb/>employed in that in slaves. But on this 
<lb/>coast it is still the old system of paltry 
<lb/>peddling in ivory and gold dust and slaving 
<lb/>as often as there is opportunity. If none 
<lb/>but a few convict Portuguese had been 
<lb/>allowed to enter the West the same results 
<lb/>would have followed as here - and 
<lb/>unless the navigation of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>and <placeName>Shire</placeName> is made free to all nations 
<lb/>I doubt whether we can effect much 
<lb/>when the passions of these Africans are 
<lb/>enlisted on the side of wrong the case is 
<lb/>difficult. Fortunately we have in <persName>Earl 
<lb/>Russell</persName> a man who will do all that 
<lb/>can be done to promote freedom of both 
<lb/>black and white. And in <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName> who is pre eminently the author of the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001895_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>the suppression policy we have one who 
<lb/>has done more for the good of <placeName>Africa</placeName> than any one who can be mentioned<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Being under him one cannot speak out 
<lb/>all that is felt in reviewing his long &amp; 
<lb/>unwearied labours for the abolition of 
<lb/>the slave trade, without appearing to be a 
<lb/>toady and that does not lie in my 
<lb/>line. I hope that something may be done 
<lb/>and think the Portuguese might yield it 
<lb/>as they never use the mouths of the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> or <placeName>Shire</placeName> at all. </p>
<lb/><p>The death of <persName>bishop Mackenzie</persName> was a 
<lb/>great misfortune as it created <del type="strikethrough">as</del> a 
<lb/>prejudice, and half of the exposure <add place="above">in <placeName>England</placeName></add> he 
<lb/>subjected himself to would have led to 
<lb/>his being quickly cut off by consumption<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We have had our losses too from being 
<lb/>compelled to delay a long time in a most 
<lb/>unhealthy locality, but these cases 
<lb/>are accidental. We have the prospect 
<lb/>of half a dozen Scotch mechanics joining 
<lb/>us soon. They worked at their trades 
<lb/>in Shival North and <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Burnet</persName> the 
<lb/>commissioner gives a good report 
<lb/>of them. Their wages went to a common 
<lb/>fund out of which waggons were bought 
<lb/>and they were ready to proceed overland 
<lb/>when the Governor asked me if they 
<lb/>might not rather be sent by sea. They 
<lb/>seem just the men we want and 
<lb/>I have recommended them to try 
<lb/>and set an example of independent 
<lb/>industry and Christian life before 
<lb/>the inhabitants of the Lake. </p>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001895_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/><p>We went up the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> about 
<lb/>156 miles or 114 as the crow flies during 
<lb/>September &amp; October last. People near the 
<lb/>coast unfriendly but further inland 
<lb/>all we could expect, the lands on each 
<lb/>bank rise up 400 or 500 feet - the edge 
<lb/>of a plateau though they look like ranges 
<lb/>of hills - the country well wooded &amp; fertile, pieces of coal seen in the sands 
<lb/>but tsetse prevails, the river takes 
<lb/>us twice on to the slave route from 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName> to <placeName>Quiloa</placeName> - we turned at some 
<lb/>low rapids about eleven Arab days 
<lb/>from <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName>. One day above our 
<lb/>turning point the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> is joined 
<lb/>by the <placeName>Liendi</placeName> which rises on the mountains 
<lb/>East of the Lake. <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> is still said 
<lb/>to come out of it as formerly but the 
<lb/>passage is narrow and down rocks 
<lb/>this will be our outlet rather than pay 
<lb/>dues to Portuguese but it is hard to 
<lb/>leave the route we opened &amp; rendered 
<lb/>safe to vile slave hunters. </p>
<lb/><p>I am glad to hear from our Friend 
<lb/><persName>Maclear</persName> that you are succeeding in 
<lb/>your labours. You have our heartiest 
<lb/>good wishes. If you still wish to do 
<lb/>us a good turn write a line for 
<lb/>a word from you is ever valuable 
<lb/>and exhilarating<reg>.</reg> Believe me <reg>.</reg></p>
