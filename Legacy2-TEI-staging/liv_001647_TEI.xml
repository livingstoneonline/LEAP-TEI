<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Mohilla Island, near Comoro</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>4 April 1861. </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>You will probably have 
<lb/>heard ere this reaches you that we went 
<lb/>to the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> in February and made 
<lb/>an attempt to ascend that river in March. 
<lb/>Our progress was arrested when only some 
<lb/>thirty miles from the mouth by observing 
<lb/>that the water was falling at the rate of seven 
<lb/>inches a day; we had come over some 
<lb/>parts not more than five or six feet deep 
<lb/>and our vessel was drawing four &amp; a half 
<lb/>feet so we had to make up our minds 
<lb/>whether to proceed further and remain among 
<lb/>a people whom we do not know till next 
<lb/>flood, or come back and work on our 
<lb/>old "spoon" up the <placeName>Shire.</placeName>
<lb/>The detention 
<lb/>would have been such a waste of time 
<lb/>for those who remained at <placeName>Johanna</placeName>, &amp; would not have advanced the objects 
<lb/>of those who had come to <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> more 
<lb/>effectually than by spending the same 
<lb/>period up the <placeName>Shire:</placeName> For the general 
<lb/>good therefore we returned and were 
<lb/>favoured by a rise in the river of 
<lb/>three or four feet - this last is said 
<lb/>to be the last flood of the year. And 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001647_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>made us fully alive to the fact that 
<lb/>from one canoe or another we were 
<lb/>quite two months too late for successful exploration. </p>
<lb/><p>From the little that we saw we are 
<lb/>disposed to think favourably of the river 
<lb/>as an entrance into <placeName>Eastern Africa</placeName>. It 
<lb/>has a sandy bottom <add place="above">three quarters of a mile broad</add> and partakes much 
<lb/>of the character of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. Unlike 
<lb/>that river with its abominable bars, 
<lb/>it flows into a magnificent bay, and 
<lb/>the only danger in its mile wide mouth 
<lb/>is a sort of "bore" formed by the 
<lb/>water of the river a few fathoms 
<lb/>meeting the ocean tide of nineteen fathoms. 
<lb/>At full tide it is all smooth. By keeping 
<lb/>near the shore it is quite safe at all 
<lb/>periods of the tide. We have a very 
<lb/>short delta and the land rises up from 
<lb/>the banks in a gentle slope to 300 or 400 
<lb/>feet. It is well wooded the ebony 
<lb/>attaining a much larger size than it 
<lb/>does anywhere on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. The 
<lb/>country is very beautiful but there is 
<lb/>something wrong among the people. 
<lb/>Food seemed scarce in a soil where 
<lb/>everything could grow. Half caste Arabs 
<lb/>appear to lord it over the general population 
<lb/>and they were inclined to do the same 
<lb/>with us. When my brother took the Makololo 
<lb/>on shore to cut wood some of them came 
<lb/>and assumed the airs we read of in 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001647_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><choice><sic>in</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> countries further North. They demanded 
<lb/>payment for the wood and he offered to 
<lb/>give it provided that they should cut it. 
<lb/>But no, they would seize that already cut, 
<lb/>the Makololo were unarmed but made 
<lb/>a rush to their arms. "They would not 
<lb/>let their white men be imposed on" the 
<lb/>bastards made a rush the other way, 
<lb/>and could scarcely be prevailed on to 
<lb/>come back and take up the vegetables 
<lb/>they had left behind. But for this little 
<lb/>shew of pluck we should have had the 
<lb/>company of these half castes at every 
<lb/>village. Fines levied on every possible 
<lb/>pretext, and the word passed on beyond 
<lb/>their beat that we were a herd of she asses 
<lb/>to be milked for the public benefit. It is of the utmost importance here, as in Europe 
<lb/>for the people to feel that you are not dependant 
<lb/>on them. If they see that you can get on 
<lb/>without them <reg>,</reg> they are much more obliging 
<lb/>you could not have done a wiser deed 
<lb/>than give my friend <persName>Captain Speke</persName> the 
<lb/>Hottentot <choice><sic>gaurd</sic><corr>guard</corr></choice>. If they <add place="above">continue stead fast and</add>escape fever, 
<lb/>which is rather doubtful as people of colour 
<lb/>are as liable to it as whites, his opinion 
<lb/>of the general population will be raised 
<lb/>about 300 per cent. I have always 
<lb/>found that the presence of a trusty band 
<lb/>of Makololo, though useless for ship 
<lb/>work, was invaluable on land. It 
<lb/>was not without considerable regret 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001647_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>that we gave up the project of a land 
<lb/>journey with them up the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>. 
<lb/>It was the worst season for travelling, 
<lb/>rain, and heavy dews would have 
<lb/>cut us up. In fact the same reasons 
<lb/>that prevailed for the postponement 
<lb/>of the landing of the Mission still 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>tinued</w> in force. By the time we reach 
<lb/>the <placeName>Shire</placeName> we shall be back in the healthier 
<lb/>season, and a beginning will be made 
<lb/>of the general labours from the other 
<lb/>end of <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> to that we looked 
<lb/>on by the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>. It is curious 
<lb/>that all the people declare that <del type="strikethrough">Ny</del><placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>comes out of <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. This, according to 
<lb/>a curious idea that has come over the 
<lb/>geographical mind in <placeName>England</placeName>, must 
<lb/>mean that <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> comes out <add place="above">of</add><placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>I wish our good friends would only 
<lb/>tell us all about it beforehand. It would 
<lb/>save us a great deal of trouble. And 
<lb/>deliver us from the perplexity of guessing 
<lb/>and grumbling. We see for instance 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName> never discolours in flood, but is 
<lb/>always of a dark mossy hue = carries 
<lb/>a great deal of mica, <add place="above">has a muddy bottom</add>and never rises 
<lb/>or falls more than a few feet. <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> rises some five or six feet - is very brown 
<lb/>&amp; muddy, but has a sandy bottom. Water 
<lb/>carries little or no mica, and tastes of 
<lb/>rain rather than moss. Now anything positive 
<lb/>if given beforehand will be thankfully <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>though it comes from the Archives of Prester John <reg>.</reg></p>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001647_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
<lb/><p>P.S. <placeName>Johanna</placeName>, at <persName>W<hi rend="sup underline">m</hi> Sunley's 
<lb/>H. M. Consul,</persName><placeName>Comoro Islands</placeName>. </p>
<lb/><p>We require two well trained strong 
<lb/>mules fit for and used to either 
<lb/>harness or the saddle. 
<lb/>And two 
<lb/>good strong Scotch carts with 
<lb/>harness &amp;c complete to transport 
<lb/>goods past <placeName>Murchison's Cataracts</placeName>. 
<lb/>And I have to beg you to place 
<lb/>the matter in proper hands 
<lb/>paying what may <add place="above">reasonably</add> be necessary 
<lb/>on account of the Expedition. 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Frederick Rutherfoord</persName>
<lb/>might be a proper person 
<lb/>but I don<reg>'</reg>t know whether 
<lb/>he undertakes these sort of 
<lb/>matters - there is plenty of time 
<lb/>as we expect them to meet 
<lb/>us by a man of war which 
<lb/>we beg may be sent to meet 
<lb/>us at <placeName>Kongone</placeName> on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>
<lb/>January 1862. We shall not, 
<lb/>indeed cannot return to the 
<lb/>sea till then. </p>
<lb/><p>If a small steamer we 
<lb/>expect comes before that 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001647_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/>and the bishop<reg>'</reg>s sisters should 
<lb/>wish to come by that opportunity 
<lb/>I shall be glad if you instruct 
<lb/>the person in charge to afford 
<lb/>every facility to any one 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>nected</w> with the mission in his 
<lb/>power - either by coming up 
<lb/>to the Pioneer at <placeName>Chibisa's</placeName>
<lb/>or <placeName>Dakanamoio island</placeName> and 
<lb/>offloading, then returning for 
<lb/>all their luggage or acting in 
<lb/>anyway that may be seen most 
<lb/>serviceable to the general interests. 
<lb/>I should like now to see my own 
<lb/>wife appear on the scene but 
<lb/>we have a tough bit of work 
<lb/>in getting up a boat and examining 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName>, and <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> as the 
<lb/>Anatomical lecturers say "from above 
<lb/>downwards and from before 
<lb/>backwards" - What do you say 3 to 1 for <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>out of <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> against &amp;c &amp;c <reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>About the mules I sometimes 
<lb/>think a horse &amp; mare for breeding 
<lb/>purposes might be preferable but 
<lb/>we might stumble into tsetse and then 
<lb/>everybody will say "why we knew that" 
<lb/>"I told you so." </p>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001647_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/><p> I propose to submit a spot near 
<lb/>the village marked "Chizunze's" not 
<lb/>far from the bottom of <placeName>Zomba </placeName>
<lb/>for the bishop's inspection the 
<lb/>head man called <persName>Chibaba</persName> is a 
<lb/>fat frank jolly fellow - the 
<lb/>elevation some 3000 or 4000 
<lb/>feet above the sea, cool in the 
<lb/>hottest part of the season, and 
<lb/>well watered. This will be a 
<lb/>sanatorium, and there stands 
<lb/><placeName>Zomba's top</placeName> a day's journey up - 
<lb/>inhabited - and a fine rivulet. 
<lb/>If they become sick there they had 
<lb/>better make their wells at once 
<lb/>and not bother the doctors - Some 
<lb/>work will be required to find a 
<lb/>good sloping klooff up to the 
<lb/>first Plateau. All have had 
<lb/>fever except one. Indeed but two 
<lb/><add place="above">of the entire expedition</add> have escaped yet nothing serious 
<lb/>occurred. </p>
<lb/><p>You remember when every <placeName>Cape</placeName>
<lb/>Paper contained the great Word 
<lb/>"Mazzepa". From flaring in print 
<lb/>she has come down to carrying 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001647_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'-->
<lb/>slaves. We found her here with sixty 
<lb/>on board bought at <placeName>Kilwa</placeName><placeName>(Quiloa)</placeName> on 
<lb/>the East Coast at 22 dollars per head 
<lb/>then, the owner gave 250 dollars to 
<lb/>a chief on <placeName>Comoro island</placeName> to furnish 
<lb/>him with certificate that the slaves 
<lb/>were his own people lent as free 
<lb/>emigrants. It is here scarcely thought 
<lb/>necessary to conceal the nature of these 
<lb/>transactions, there is constant intercourse 
<lb/>between the islands &amp; the chief is rather 
<lb/>admired for the amount he extracted, 
<lb/>but the French Government Official 
<lb/>is on board and it is illegal to 
<lb/>touch her. What did the Emperor 
<lb/>mean when he said that he would 
<lb/>not have the slave trade at any 
<lb/>price? </p>
