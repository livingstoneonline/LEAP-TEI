<lb/>right to state also distinctly that I am 
<lb/>now aware that the same views were 
<lb/>clearly expressed in the anniversary speech 
<lb/>of 1852 by the gentleman to whom this 
<lb/>letter is addressed, yet having come to 
<lb/>nearly the same conclusions about 3 years 
<lb/>afterwards and by a different route, the 
<lb/>reasons which guided my tortoise pace 
<lb/>may though stated in my own way be 
<lb/>accepted as a small contribution to the

<lb/><p>In passing Northwards to <placeName>Angola</placeName> the 
<lb/>presence of large Cape Heaths, Rhododendrons &amp; 
<lb/>Alpine roses, and more especially the sudden 
<lb/>descent into the valley of the <placeName>Quango</placeName> near 
<lb/><placeName>Cassangé</placeName> led me to believe we had been 
<lb/>travelling on an elevated plateau. I had hopes 
<lb/>then of finding an Aneroid at <placeName>Loanda</placeName> but 
<lb/>having been disappointed in this I had to 
<lb/>resort on our return to the next best means 
<lb/>of measuring elevations viz. the point of 
<lb/>ebullition of water. I have no table at 
<lb/>hand for turning the degrees into feet and 
<lb/>will give therefore a list of observations only 
<lb/>and if you do not reject the instrument 
<lb/>altogether it will be allowed that there is

<lb/>which to the eye looks much higher than

<lb/>land towards the <placeName>Quango</placeName> we were 
<lb/>unconsciously near the crest of a large 
<lb/>oblong mound or ridge which probably 
<lb/>extends through 20º of Latitude and gives

<lb/>no means mountainous. The general direction of all these rivers except the 
<lb/><placeName>Coanza</placeName> and <placeName>Quango</placeName> being towards the 
<lb/>centre of the continent, with Northing or

<lb/><p>Viewing the basin from the Northward, 
<lb/>we behold an immense flat intersected

<lb/>or stone rivers either, but deep never failing

<lb/>against enemies who can neither swim 
<lb/>nor manage canoes - and they have

<lb/>with lagoons and marshes <choice><sic>ajacent</sic><corr>adjacent</corr></choice> so 
<lb/>that it is scarcely possible to travel 
<lb/>along their banks without canoes following. 
<lb/>We bought two donkies as a present from 
<lb/>certain merchants in <placeName>Loanda</placeName> to <persName>Sekelétu</persName>, 
<lb/>and as this animal is not injured by 
<lb/>the bite of the tsetse, they came as frisky 
<lb/>as kids through all the flowing rivers 
<lb/>of <placeName>Londa</placeName> but when we began to descend 
<lb/>the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> dragging them almost hourly

<lb/>and another of inundation. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he period

<lb/>being more tortuous a month later. We hear of 
<lb/>its as flooded 40 miles above <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> 8 or 10 days 
<lb/>before it overflows there. But when they do 
<lb/>overflow then the valley assumes the appearance 
<lb/>of being ornamented with chains of lakes 
<lb/>and this is probably the geologically recent 
<lb/>form in which the great basin shewed 
<lb/>for all the low water channels in the flats 
<lb/>are cut out of soft calcareous tufa 
<lb/>which the waters of this country formerly 
<lb/>deposited most copiously. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he country 
<lb/><choice><sic>ajacent</sic><corr>adjacent</corr></choice> to the beds of inundation is 
<lb/>excpet where rocks appear not elevated

<lb/>general level. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat the same formation exists on 
<lb/>the Eastern side of the country I aver 
<lb/>from the statements of Arabs or Moors 
<lb/>from <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey assert that a 
<lb/>large branch of the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> flows 
<lb/>from the country of the Banyassa 
<lb/>(Wunyassa) to the South West and passes 
<lb/>near to the town of <placeName>Cazembe</placeName>. It is 
<lb/>called <placeName>Loapola</placeName>. The Banyassa 
<lb/>live on a ridge parallel to the East coast 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000859_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'-->
<lb/>and though they have no Lake in their own 
<lb/>country, they frequently trade to one on their 
<lb/>N.N.W. My Arab informants pass this 
<lb/>on their way home to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>. It is said 
<lb/>to be ten days North East of <placeName>Cazembe</placeName> and is 
<lb/>called <placeName>Tanganyenka</placeName><!--MH: the n needs a tilda--> (Tanganyenka) <!--and again!-->
<lb/>and connected with another named 
<lb/>Kalágue (Garague?) and both are 
<lb/>stated to be so shallow the canoes are punted 
<lb/>the whole way <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice> (3 days) Will it be 
<lb/>over speculative to suppose that these
<lb/>large collections of fresh water are nought 
<lb/>else but the residua of greater and deeper 
<lb/>Lakes just as <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> is? - the openings 
<lb/>in the Eastern ridge not being deep enough 
<lb/>to drain those parts of the basin entirely. </p>
<lb/><p>In a foray made by the Makololo 
<lb/>in the country about East of Masiko's 
<lb/>during our visit to <placeName>Loanda</placeName>, they were 
<lb/>accompanied by the Arab <persName>Ben Habib</persName>
<lb/>from whom I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> much of the above 
<lb/>information, and saw another river than 
<lb/>the <placeName>Loapola</placeName> coming from the North East 
<lb/>with a South West course to form a 

	<pb n="0009" facs="liv_000859_0009"/><!--pb/@n='5r'-->
<lb/>Lake named <placeName>Shuia</placeName><placeName>Shooea</placeName> A river 
<lb/>emerges thence which dividing forms the 
<lb/><placeName>Bashukulompo</placeName> abd <placeName>Loangua</placeName> rivers. There 
<lb/>is a connection between these and the 
<lb/><placeName>Leeambye</placeName> too, a statement by no means 
<lb/>improbable seeing the country around <placeName>Shuia</placeName>
<lb/>(Lat 14º or 15º. Long 27º or 28ºE?) is described as 
<lb/>abounding in marsh and reedy vallies. 
<lb/>When there the Arab pointed to the Eastern 
<lb/>ridge whence the rivers come and said "When 
<lb/>we see that we always know we are about 
<lb/>to begin the descent of ten or fifteen days 
<lb/>to the sea" </p>
<lb/><p>I am far from craving implicit 
<lb/>faith in those statements for so many 
<lb/>possess a sad proneness to "amiability" 
<lb/>and will roundly assert whatever they 
<lb/>guess will please you. "Are you happy 
<lb/>as a slave" "O, infinitely more so than 
<lb/>when I was free." <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut my object in making 
<lb/>enquiries was unknown and when supported 
<lb/>by the testimony of the Makololo the statements 
<lb/>may be taken as supporting the view 

	<pb n="0010" facs="liv_000859_0010"/><!--pb/@n='5v'-->
<lb/>that the central parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName> south of the equator 
<lb/>though considerably elevated above the level of 
<lb/>the sea, form really a hollow in reference to 
<lb/>two oblong ridges on its Eastern and Western 
<lb/>sides. As suggestive of further enquiry 
<lb/>only I may mention though not pretending 
<lb/>to have examined the pretty extensive 
<lb/>portions of the country which came under 
<lb/>my observation with the eye and deep 
<lb/>insight of a geologist the general direction 
<lb/>of the ranges of hills. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he dip of the strata 
<lb/>being down towards the centre of the country 
<lb/>led to the conclusion before I knew of the 
<lb/>existence of the ridges - that <placeName>Africa</placeName> had 
<lb/>in its formation been pressed up much 
<lb/>more energetically at the sides than at the 
<lb/>centre.<choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he force which effected this may have 
<lb/>been of the same nature as that which determined 
<lb/>most recent volcanoes to be in the vicinity 
<lb/>of the sea. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his seems to have been the 
<lb/>case in <placeName>Angola</placeName> at least and having 
<lb/>probably been in operation over a vast 
<lb/>extent of coast probably decided the 
<lb/>very simple littoral outline of <placeName>Africa</placeName>

	<pb n="0011" facs="liv_000859_0011"/><!--pb/@n='6r'-->
<lb/>I am inclined to make this suggestion because 
<lb/>when the ridges are situated far from the coast 
<lb/>they do not seem to owe their origin to 
<lb/>recently erupted rocks. We have a section 
<lb/>of the Western ridge near <placeName>Cassangé</placeName> of nearly 
<lb/>a thousand feet perpendicularly and except 
<lb/>a capping of Haematite mixed with quartz 
<lb/>pebbles it is a mass of the red clay slate 
<lb/>termed in Scotland "Keel" the thin strata 
<lb/>of which are scarcely at all disturbed (this 
<lb/>keel is believed to indicate gold. Had I met 
<lb/>a nugget I would have mounted a 
<lb/>mule instead of the ungainly beast I rode.) </p>
<lb/><p>I have mentioned <placeName>Dilolo</placeName> as forming 
<lb/>a sort of partition in the valley but it is 
<lb/>not formed by <choice><sic>outcroping</sic><corr>outcropping</corr></choice> rocks one 
<lb/>may travel a month beyond <placeName>Shinte's</placeName> without 
<lb/>seeing a stone. But in proceeding south 
<lb/>of <placeName>Ngami</placeName> the farther we go the greater 
<lb/>has been filling up. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> parallel 
<lb/>of Latitude divides a part of the valley 
<lb/>containing one thousand feet more filling up 
<lb/>than that North of <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> and strangely 
<lb/>enough the only instance of a large 

	<pb n="0012" facs="liv_000859_0012"/><!--pb/@n='6v'-->
<lb/>transported boulder occurs first at the 
<lb/>edge of the more hollow part. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he plains to the 
<lb/>south of that are all elevated perhaps 5000 feet 
<lb/>above the level of the sea <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut the erupted 
<lb/>rocks as that on which <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> stands 
<lb/>have brought up fragments of the very old 
<lb/>bottom rocks in their substance. </p>
<lb/><p>As I am not aware whether the <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Buckland</persName> made any public use 
<lb/>of a paper I sent in 1843 on the gradual 
<lb/>desiccation of the <placeName>Bechuana country</placeName> it 
<lb/>may not be improper to mention that 
<lb/>in support of the actual drying up of 
<lb/>all the rivers which have a westerly 
<lb/>course I pointed out the bed of a 
<lb/>still more ancient river than those 
<lb/>trickling rills which now pass by the 
<lb/>name. It flowed from North to South 
<lb/>exactly as the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> does now and 
<lb/>ended in a large <add place="above">Lake</add> which must have 
<lb/>been discharged when the fizzure was 
<lb/>made through which the orange river 
<lb/>now flows. At the point of confluence 
<lb/>between river and Lake some hills

<lb/>of amygdaloid caused an eddy and 
<lb/>in the eddy we have a mound of tufa 
<lb/>and travertin full of fossil bones. From 
<lb/>these I had hopes of ascertaining the age 
<lb/>of the river but in addition to be being 
<lb/>much restricted by sacred duties as to 
<lb/>time I have been singularly unfortunate 
<lb/>in learning geology. I had no instrument 
<lb/>with me when I discovered these beautiful 
<lb/>fossils which stand out in relief on the 
<lb/>rock. <choice><reg>O</reg><orig>o</orig></choice>n the second occasion I was 
<lb/>called off by express to the child of another 
<lb/>missionary and galloped a hundred miles 
<lb/>to find him in his grave and to crown 
<lb/>all some epiphises and teeth which I picked up 
<lb/>when sent with specimens to illustrate 
<lb/>the geology of the interior though taken 
<lb/>to <placeName>England</placeName> by the <persName>Rev. H. H. Methuen</persName>
<lb/>were stolen from the railway before 
<lb/>reaching the venerable Doctor's hands. 
<lb/>As it is not likely I shall ever visit 
<lb/>the spot again I may mention that 
<lb/>the mound is near <placeName>Bootschap</placeName> and 
<lb/>well known to <persName>Rev H. Helmore</persName> who 

	<pb n="0014" facs="liv_000859_0014"/><!--pb/@n='7v'-->
<lb/>would willingly shew it to any one desirous 
<lb/>of procuring specimens. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are perfectly 
<lb/>fossilized and in shape resemble those of 
<lb/>Zebras or buffaloes. </p>
<lb/><p>With respect to the spirit in which 
<lb/>our efforts have been viewed by the 
<lb/>Makololo, I think there is no cause 
<lb/>for discouragement. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he men of 
<lb/>my company worked vigorously 
<lb/>while at <placeName>Loanda</placeName> and saved what 
<lb/>to them appeared considerable property. 
<lb/>But the long journey back forced 
<lb/>us to expend all our goods and 
<lb/>on arriving at the <placeName>Barotse</placeName> we were all equally poor. Our reception 
<lb/>and subsequent treatment were 
<lb/>however most generous and kind. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he public reports delivered by my 
<lb/>companions were to me sufficiently 
<lb/>flattering and their private opinions 
<lb/>must have been in unison for 

	<pb n="0015" facs="liv_000859_0015"/><!--pb/@n='8r'-->
<lb/>many volunteers have come forward 
<lb/>uncalled for to go to the East. A fresh 
<lb/>party was dispatched with ivory for 
<lb/><placeName>Loanda</placeName> and only two days allowed for 
<lb/>preparation. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are under the guidance 
<lb/>of the afore mentioned Arab from <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>
<lb/>the men having no voice in the disposal 
<lb/>of the goods. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are simply to look 
<lb/>and learn. After my late companions 
<lb/>have rested sometime it is intended 
<lb/>that they return as independent traders 
<lb/>and so of the others this was not my 
<lb/>suggestion indeed I could scarcely 
<lb/>have expected it; for the hunger and 
<lb/>fatigue they endured were most trying 
<lb/>to men who have abundance of food 
<lb/>and leizure at home. But the spirit 
<lb/>of trade is very strong in the Africans 
<lb/>and they are so elated with the large 
<lb/>prices given at <placeName>Loanda</placeName>. If no untoward 
<lb/>event interferes a vigorous trade will 
<lb/>certainly be established. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he knowledge

<lb/>of the great value of ivory puts a stop to 
<lb/>the slave trade in a very natural way 
<lb/>our cruizers on the West coast render 
<lb/>property in slaves of very small value 
<lb/>there - the Mambari who are generally 
<lb/>subjects of Kangombe of Bihé or 
<lb/>Bié purchase slaves for domestic 
<lb/>purposes only but to make such

<lb/>The above ideal section of the country between 9¨ and 10¨ South Latitude and 13¨ - 18¨ East Longitude is sent with a sense 
<lb/>of its many imperfections. I would scarcely have ventured to send it at all in its present state, but having once indulged 
<lb/>the hope of forming a geological map of the country North of the <placeName>Orange river</placeName> as far as <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> I made a very extensive 
<lb/>collection of specimens of rocks for the purpose. As I did not know many of them while waiting for farther information
<lb/>I lost both specimens and papers in the destruction of <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> by the Boers. This misfortune makes me anxious to 
<lb/>send any information I can pick up out of harm's way. The following additional remarks may not be out of the way. </p>
<lb/><p>Between 3 and 4 in the district of <placeName>Cazengo</placeName> the igneous rocks indicated at 2 have evidently ran through gorges 
<lb/>in the mountain ranges 4444 and have tilted up schist, gneiss &amp;c. and in the latter veins may be seen or rather 
<lb/>cracks filled with a dark blue rock exactly like clay slate. Between 3 and 4 too in the districts of <placeName>Cazengo</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Golungo Alto</placeName> abundance of excellent iron ore occurs. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>ome strongly magnetic, others not; but all very
<lb/>largely impregnated with the metal. To the North of 2 and 3 near the river <placeName>Dande</placeName> Petroleum is reported and 
<lb/>so it is said to occur - southwards of 5 from under the dark red sandstone which forms the crust of the 
<lb/>country. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he spot reported is on the banks of the <placeName>Coauya</placeName> and near <placeName>Cambambe</placeName>. Veins of copper appear on 
<lb/>the banks of the <placeName>Coauya</placeName> in the same district but I did not see them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he rocks of <placeName>Pungo Andongo</placeName> (7) are large 
<lb/>masses of conglomerate about 300 or 400 feet above the surrounding country. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey stand in parallel lines nearly 
<lb/>N. and S. in direction and rather more than a mile in length the conglomerate stands on horizontal strata of dark red 
<lb/>sandstone and this in a very small proportion to the other materials forms the matrix. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here are granite, gneiss, porphyry, 
<lb/>schist, clay, and sandstone, trap syenite greenstone - quartzite &amp;c &amp;c all rounded and waterworn and forming immense 
<lb/>masses of shingle. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is also a kind of soft limestone containing sea shell on the tops of some of the rocks<reg>.</reg>   D.L. </p><!--MH: Funny columns under a map, I've coded them as addspans--><addSpan spanTo="#p9r-01" place="below"><!--addSpan/@place='under map of fols.'--></addSpan>
