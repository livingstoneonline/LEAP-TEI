<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kongone Harbour</placeName> 30 Dec<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> July 1859</p>
<lb/><p>Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>We are now about 
<lb/>to deliver our letters to H.M.S. 
<lb/>Persian and though I know 
<lb/>that she has one on board 
<lb/>for you of May last I add 
<lb/>a few words to that as we 
<lb/>are sending some Buaze 
<lb/>seeds and living plants 
<lb/>of the Motsikiri. <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk </persName>
<lb/>will write <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> MacGibbon </persName>
<lb/>as to how they are to be 
<lb/>disposed and I have now 
<lb/>to beg your good offices 
<lb/>for speedy transmission 
<lb/>to their destination. The 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001457_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>Buaze will do well in <placeName>Natal</placeName>
<lb/>in localities where other cultivation 
<lb/>is impossible, should it grow 
<lb/>no care is required for an 
<lb/>annual crop, (a comfortable 
<lb/>fact for all Hottentots English 
<lb/>Dutch &amp; African) for it is 
<lb/>simply pollarded when the 
<lb/>fibre is mature in the thinner 
<lb/>branches, the seeds yield a 
<lb/>paint or drying oil, some are 
<lb/>for <placeName>India</placeName> &amp; others for <placeName>Natal</placeName>, 
<lb/>and we shall send more when 
<lb/>we can, there are plants 
<lb/>too of Motsikiri, a tree the seed 
<lb/>of which yields a fat &amp; an oil 
<lb/>valuable in commerce. It 
<lb/>is exported from <placeName>Inhambane.</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>We have sent home a 
<lb/>Report the joint production of <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk </persName> and myself on the 
<lb/>African fever, and we think 
<lb/>our experience of it has rendered 
<lb/>it a less formidable disease 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001457_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>than heretofore. This will probably be 
<lb/>published. </p>
<lb/><p>We have been able to furnish a 
<lb/>report on the navigation of the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> after seeing all the changes 
<lb/>to which it is annually liable. From 
<lb/>what we have observed in an 
<lb/>unusually dry year a vessel drawing 
<lb/>two feet such as they are obliged 
<lb/>to use on the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> could 
<lb/>ply the whole of ordinary years<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>During four or five months 
<lb/>each year large vessels could 
<lb/>ascend to <placeName>Tette</placeName>. There the river 
<lb/>is 964 yards from bank to bank 
<lb/>about three times the width of <placeName>Thames</placeName> at <placeName>London Bridge</placeName>
<lb/>at the broadest parts it is 
<lb/>about 3 miles, and divided 
<lb/>into five or six channels. A 
<lb/>Tide Pole put up at my suggestion 
<lb/>by <persName>Major Secard</persName> shewed a 
<lb/>gradual rise above low 
<lb/>water mark of eight feet, then 
<lb/>a variation from 8 to fifteen feet 
<lb/>during some months. The 
<lb/><add place="below">then a gradual decrease to 3 1/2</add>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001457_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>low water mark adopted was <add place="above">the surface of</add> that 
<lb/>in which from 18 inches to 24 inches, 
<lb/>were found in certain crossings 
<lb/>from one channel to another. 
<lb/>The channels then contained reaches 
<lb/>of miles in length of 8 or 10 feet, 
<lb/>but in the crossings we had 
<lb/>much difficulty, the vessel of 31-3 inches
<lb/>being of what is called the "the Niger 
<lb/>canoe or potbellied shape" &amp; so 
<lb/>weak an engine as to be unable 
<lb/>to help us in the difficulty. She was 
<lb/>only 1 1/16 of an inch thick in the 
<lb/>beginning and is now like an 
<lb/>old copper kettle full of holes 
<lb/>at one part. We are about to 
<lb/>try <placeName>Nyinyasi</placeName> from the <placeName>Shire</placeName>, 
<lb/>if she will only stick together so 
<lb/>long. The <placeName>Shire</placeName> is more easily navigated 
<lb/>from the Zambesi as we have 2 or 3 
<lb/>fathoms constantly &amp; can steam by 
<lb/>night. We are in hopes, after surmounting 
<lb/>a thirty mile difficulty of getting on the 
<lb/>Lakes of <placeName>Eastern Africa</placeName>,and then 
<lb/>we go to the <placeName>Makololo Country</placeName> either 
<lb/>afloat or afoot<reg>.</reg><persName>David Livingstone</persName></p><addSpan spanTo="#p1r-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left hand margin of fol. 1r-01'--></addSpan>
<lb/><p>I wonder why our Cape Merchants don<reg>'</reg>t push their merchandise 
<lb/>higher up the coast. The <placeName>Tette</placeName> traders have been compelled to wait 
<lb/>four months at <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> for calicoes or till an American ship came<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>They are yard wide coarse unbleached calicoes &amp; dearer than the English. 
<lb/>Gentoos from <placeName>India</placeName> give higher prices for ivory in English calico than the 
<lb/>Americans can afford<reg>.</reg></p><anchor xml:id="p1r-01"/>
