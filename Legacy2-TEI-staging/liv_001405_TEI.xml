<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Tette</placeName> 19<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> February 1859</p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Sir George</persName></p>
<lb/><p>In my last I told 
<lb/>you of our visit to <placeName>Kebra basa</placeName>
<lb/>and I am happy now to be able 
<lb/>to inform you that it has been 
<lb/>visited again since the water 
<lb/>began to rise and the reports 
<lb/>of <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> C. Livingstone</persName> and <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Baines</persName> fully confirm what 
<lb/>I advanced as to effect of a 
<lb/>flood. Several of the cataracts 
<lb/>which at low water seemed 
<lb/>very serious obstacles are 
<lb/>rendered so smooth that but 
<lb/>for the adjacent mountains 
<lb/>having been sketched they 
<lb/>would not have been recognized 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001405_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>but a steamer capable of stemming 
<lb/>the main current is necessary for 
<lb/>the ascent. The river is now 15 feet 
<lb/>above low water mark in November 
<lb/>and as it is expected to rise considerably 
<lb/>more 
<lb/>I felt inclined to take advantage 
<lb/>of it and haul this vessel through 
<lb/>but besides the risk of doubling her 
<lb/>up she can carry so little cargo 
<lb/>we would soon be without 
<lb/>supplies after we had succeeded. 
<lb/>We shall therefore work for a while 
<lb/>on this side the rapid, and as a 
<lb/>beginning I may mention that 
<lb/>we went up the <placeName>Shire</placeName> about the 
<lb/>beginning of January and found 
<lb/>it a good navigable river for 
<lb/>at least one hundred miles from 
<lb/>its confluence. The Mountain 
<lb/><placeName>Morambala</placeName> is 4000 ft high and 
<lb/>has a wonderfully well cultivated 
<lb/>large top. Lemon trees grow quite 
<lb/>wild in the woods &amp; so do oranges 
<lb/>&amp; pine apples. There are several 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001405_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>fine little fountains with water slightly 
<lb/>chalybeate - the people independent &amp; 
<lb/>very hospitable. The view from the 
<lb/>top of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> winding across an 
<lb/>extended plain inhabited by real 
<lb/>Lotophagi is magnificent and 
<lb/>as you may judge from the 
<lb/>height we have quite a different 
<lb/>climate from that of the plains<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The vegetation is very like that 
<lb/>of <placeName>Londa</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Angola</placeName>. We have 
<lb/>also a fine hot sulphureous 
<lb/>fountain at the base (174ยบ) yet 
<lb/>no advantage has been taken of 
<lb/>this splendid sanatorium by the Portguese. The valley of the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>at one part abounds in Elephants 
<lb/>and if you come to see us 
<lb/>about January I undertake to 
<lb/>shew five hundred of these noble 
<lb/>animals grazing on one plain<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We saw more than that - and as 
<lb/>there are branches of the river which 
<lb/>form islands we sometimes chased 
<lb/>them with this vessel. They had 
<lb/>magnificent tusks. I think that they 
<lb/>are attracted down from the hills by 
<lb/>the sweet fruit of wild Palmyras of 
<lb/>which there are fine forests there. 
<lb/>The people were very suspicious 
<lb/>of us never having been visited 
<lb/>by Europeans before but treated 
<lb/>us civilly. Our wooding parties 
<lb/>were never molested - yet a 
<lb/><choice><sic>gaurd</sic><corr>guard</corr></choice> was set over us both night 
<lb/>and day. They are well armed 
<lb/>with bows and poisoned 
<lb/>arrows. The women insert an 
<lb/>ornament exactly the size and 
<lb/>shape of the rings for table napkins 
<lb/>into the upper lip - the effect 
<lb/>is frightful. It is a most unaccountable 
<lb/>ornament. They cultivate largely on 
<lb/>the upper third of the <placeName>Shire</placeName><choice><sic>vally</sic><corr>valley</corr></choice>
<lb/>and we purchased abundance of 
<lb/>provisions at a cheap rate besides 
<lb/>specimens of their cotton &amp; cotton yarn<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001405_0004"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
<lb/>They have two kinds of cotton and 
<lb/>both very good in quality.</p>
<lb/><p>Our first object was to 
<lb/>gain their confidence and 
<lb/>seeing them so suspicious, 
<lb/>though we had pretty certain 
<lb/>information of the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>becoming smooth again 
<lb/>beyond the cataract which 
<lb/>stopped our progress and 
<lb/>that Arabs from <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>
<lb/>were in the habit of coming 
<lb/>down in canoes from 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Nyanja</placeName> we thought 
<lb/>it imprudent to leave the 
<lb/>vessel in their power 
<lb/>and go overland. We leave 
<lb/>them to allow our first 
<lb/>visit to have its effect 
<lb/>and in the course of a 
<lb/>month return to them again<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001405_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/>The reason why the Portuguese 
<lb/>have not gone farther up than 
<lb/>about <placeName>Marambala</placeName> is probably 
<lb/>the steady rapidity of the current 
<lb/>(2 1/2 knots) there are no still 
<lb/>reaches and with the heavy Zambesi 
<lb/>canoes it is difficult to get on 
<lb/>in a current. The people too 
<lb/>have a bad name - they are 
<lb/>said to have killed some native 
<lb/>traders. In 1856 when I was 
<lb/>coming down past the mouth 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> I was told that an 
<lb/>expedition had been sent up 
<lb/>but was unable to go far because 
<lb/>the river was blocked up with 
<lb/>duckweed - quantities of that were 
<lb/>then coming out of the river 
<lb/>but at 25 miles from the 
<lb/>confluence the duckweed ceases 
<lb/>so the Expedition could not have gone far<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001405_0006"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/>Above that the river widens a 
<lb/>little but it is free from sand banks 
<lb/>and deep. Indeed it may be said 
<lb/>to be superior to the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>for steam navigation. We could 
<lb/>go on at night even.</p>
<lb/><p>This is our most unhealthy 
<lb/>season. <term type="ailment">Fever</term> is fatal on 
<lb/>the coast. Here we have some 
<lb/>of it but no one dies in 
<lb/>consequence. Three of our 
<lb/>party have had touches of it 
<lb/>but are better. This is the 
<lb/>edge of the high healthy lands 
<lb/>where I have still every reason 
<lb/>to believe that Europeans 
<lb/>might live in safety. We are 
<lb/>longing somewhat for news 
<lb/>having <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> none 
<lb/>except the papers you were 
<lb/>kind enough to send us by 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">Lynx</term>.</p>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001405_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4v'-->
<lb/><p>I have litle hopes of doing any good 
<lb/>with the people under or in contact with 
<lb/>the Portuguese. A year or more must 
<lb/>elapse ere they recover from the 
<lb/>effects of their late war - but I think 
<lb/>more highly of the capabilities of the 
<lb/>country for the produce England 
<lb/>stands most in need of than ever<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I could collect a waggon load or two 
<lb/>of Indigo from the streets of <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>tomorrow. <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName> made some 
<lb/>with it and cotton though burned 
<lb/>down annually springs up <del type="strikethrough">annually</del>
<lb/>as brisk as ever. The people here 
<lb/>make sugar, of this I was not aware 
<lb/>before. We have put up our little 
<lb/>engine to shew what machinery 
<lb/>can do: her first work was to saw 
<lb/>up planks to make a boat, which 
<lb/><persName>Major Secard</persName> our best friend was 
<lb/>about to build. We try sugar <add place="above">cane</add> as soon 
<lb/>as it is ready to cut<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>I have been trying to get the Lord's prayer

<lb/><p>A <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">d</hi></hi> D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Russel</persName> of <unclear cert="low">Maynooth</unclear> College gave me a Bunda poem

<lb/><p>I have got a portion of the Lord's prayer - &amp; Ave Maria from an 
<lb/>old blind woman. Another old lady here remembers the two black 
<lb/>traders coming here from Angola on whom the Portuguese lay their claims 
<lb/>for having crossed the continent - they never went to the coast so she says<reg>.</reg></p><anchor xml:id="p.3r"/>
