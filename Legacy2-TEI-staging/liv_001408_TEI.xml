<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bleek</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Presuming that His 
<lb/>Excellency the Governor has gone to 
<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, I enclose a copy of the Lord's 
<lb/>prayer and Creed to you - they are 
<lb/>as nearly as we can ascertain 
<lb/>what the jesuits taught here more 
<lb/>than a hundred years ago. Some old 
<lb/>blind women were the depositories 
<lb/>and  <add place="above">words</add> were taken down at their 
<lb/>dictation by <persName>S<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Candido</persName> &amp; <persName>Pascoal</persName>
<lb/>who know the dialect of <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>thoroughly. <persName>Major Secard</persName>
<lb/>with 
<lb/>his usual kindness did all he 
<lb/>could to secure correctness. So 
<lb/>I think that remembering the 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001408_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>difficulty of getting ladies who had 
<lb/>always sung them to speak slowly, 
<lb/>you must reward us by placing 
<lb/>the documents in some little nook 
<lb/>of the "Library" till you get better. </p>
<lb/><p>As I never answered your kind 
<lb/>note when about to leave the <placeName>Cape</placeName>
<lb/>I may now do it so far by giving 
<lb/>you a few remarks on the term. 
<lb/>Batsuana, for that if I mistake 
<lb/>not is the way you (mis)spell it. 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Moffat<reg>'</reg>s</persName> idea is probably the 
<lb/>right one, but as a philologist you 
<lb/>may like to hear why some minds 
<lb/>prefer the meaning of "likeness" or 
<lb/>equality"<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>When sex is spoken of in connection 
<lb/>with colour the diminutive form 
<lb/>is invariably applied - thus khoma 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001408_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>e tseu = a  white ox - i.e. altogether white 
<lb/>khomu e ts<!-- symbol-->ana = a white cow - not 
<lb/>a little but entirely white. Khomu e 
<lb/>entsu = a black ox - Khomu e 
<lb/>tsuána a black cow = quite black. 
<lb/>K. e khueba = a speckled ox. K. e 
<lb/>khuebana a speckled cow - the 
<lb/>idea of littleness seems to go to denote 
<lb/>sex by the lesser size of the females - 
<lb/>the males being <del type="strikethrough">sometimes</del> denoted 
<lb/>by tóna big - in the same way. </p>
<lb/><p>This point is not adverted to 
<lb/>in the analysis but it is so distinctly 
<lb/>adhered to in the language that an 
<lb/>additional syllable is introduced 
<lb/>to express a little of any colour, thus 
<lb/>Mosheu = a white man - 
<w>Mosheu-<lb break="no"/>enyana</w> = a little white man - 
<lb/>Montsu = a black one = 
<w>Montsun-<lb break="no"/>enyana</w> = a little white man - 
<lb/>Montsu = a black one = 
<w>Montsun-<lb break="no"/>yana</w> = a little <del type="strikethrough">white</del><add place="above">black</add> one = one of 
<lb/>the diminutive being referred to the colour 
<lb/>not size<reg>.</reg>

<lb/><persName>Sebituane's</persName> daughters is called <persName>Montsuyane</persName>
<lb/>from her colour being as light as an 
<lb/>Arab woman's - i.e. only a little black. </p>
<lb/><p>Were it not for the cow difficulty the 
<lb/>term Batsuáa would be better translated 
<lb/>as a "little black" instead of a little white - 
<lb/>they were a little blacker than the bushmen 
<lb/>&amp; Hottentots, they had intercourse with them 
<lb/>but having had none with the people 
<lb/>beyond the Desert, to say they are a little 
<lb/>whiter than these people, is to reason 
<lb/>from our own knowledge of what is 
<lb/>only partially the case, the Bat<!-- symbol-->ka for 
<lb/>instance, <add place="above">and Blanyai</add>, and other tribes being as a light 
<lb/>as they are. The above is against, hear 
<lb/>pro - in one sentence - A man was checked by <persName>Sechele</persName> for telling him some heathen story<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He did not wish to hear it. "you are under 
<lb/>the Southern people" said the man in a pet 
<lb/>"Re Batauana" replied <persName>Sechele</persName>, I follow 
<lb/>what I find in the book. I am not inferior 
<lb/>or under them." If he had been applying 
<lb/>a feminine term to himself his assertions 
<lb/>of equality would have been meaningless<reg>.</reg><persName>D. Livingstone</persName></p>
