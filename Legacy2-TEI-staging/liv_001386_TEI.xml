<lb/><p>Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>We have been up 
<lb/>to examine the rapids of 
<lb/><placeName>Kebra</placeName> or more correctly <placeName><w>Kaora-<lb break="no"/>basa</w></placeName> when the water in the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> was at its lowest 
<lb/>and we found that all we 
<lb/>knew of the it previously from 
<lb/>Portuguese description was 
<lb/>just nothing at all. We 
<lb/>steamed about four miles 
<lb/>beyond where any description 
<lb/>we could get even here 
<lb/>terminated and found that 
<lb/>instead of a number of detached 
<lb/>rocks jutting out of the water 
<lb/>across the stream the affair arises from the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>

<lb/>being confined by mountains 
<lb/>to a bed 1/4 mile wide at parts 
<lb/>and at one point to 50 or 60 yards<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>In the wider parts there is a deep 
<lb/>groove cut out of the solid rock 
<lb/>if such it can be called where 
<lb/>rocks are twisted, broken, cleaved 
<lb/>&amp; huddled together in every direction 
<lb/>besides being water worn and 
<lb/>drilled with potholes everywhere<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>When sailing up the groove with 
<lb/>the walls far above our masts 
<lb/>the man at the lead kept calling 
<lb/>out "no bottom at ten fathoms" 
<lb/>yet the groove fills at flood 
<lb/>and flows over the adjacent 
<lb/>bed though to do so it must 
<lb/>rise perpendicularly 80 or 100 feet<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>There are rapids in the groove 
<lb/>which this feeble vessel cannot 
<lb/>stem but we have no doubt 
<lb/>that a steamer of good power 
<lb/>would go up easily at flood 
<lb/>one rapid which had five feet

<lb/>of fall became level at three 
<lb/>feet general rise of the river - the 
<lb/>Ma Robert was just 1/16 of an inch 
<lb/>thick when new - it is now thinner 
<lb/>so we fear to try towing 
<lb/>her up lest she should go craunch 
<lb/>like an old tin kettle in the operation<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>There is also a place with 
<w>per-<lb break="no"/>pendicular</w> walls past which 
<lb/>no towing line could be carried<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The mountains are at least 
<lb/>2000 or 2300 feet high, covered 
<lb/>with trees and very healthy<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>As far as the can reach 
<lb/>Northwest we see ranges of the 
<lb/>same even into the blue 
<lb/>distance. We slept without cover 
<lb/>or quinine &amp; but for the toil 
<lb/>which was excessive we 
<lb/>should all have returned improved 
<lb/>in health. It made us so 
<lb/>lean that had I come down 
<lb/>this way in 1856 I should have 
<lb/>perished before reaching <placeName>Tette</placeName>. 
<lb/>It is an impediment to

<lb/>navigation i.e. canoe or bum - 
<lb/>boat navigation - they cannot paddle 
<lb/>against a four knot current and 
<lb/>then here they cannot punt at 60 feet 
<lb/>deep nor tow from a height of 
<lb/>80 ft so they go over land. We have 
<lb/>abundance of work in the mean 
<lb/>time down here, the geologist reports 
<lb/>having found 3 seams of coal 
<lb/>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 7 feet thick 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 13 ft 6in. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> twenty 
<lb/>five feet thick in a five cliff section<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It was fired by lightning a few years 
<lb/>ago and burned a long time. We 
<lb/>are all in good health. Have had 
<lb/>colds only, no fever except among 
<lb/>the Kroomen. The Portuguese command 
<w>-<lb break="no"/>and</w><persName>Major Secard</persName> gave us the 
<lb/>Residencia of Government house 
<lb/>to live in at <placeName>Tette</placeName> I am going up 
<lb/>the <placeName>Shire</placeName> next week. </p>
<lb/><p>Thanks for the pamphlet containing 
<lb/>the account of your library. I made 
<lb/>a collection of Bechuana orations 
<lb/>Maina or names they are called and 
<lb/>each boy must produce his own at 
<lb/>the circumcision. They contained a great 
<lb/>number of to me entirely new words. I 
<lb/>intended to have examined &amp; translated 
<lb/>them but the boers in plundering <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName><addSpan spanTo="#p.1r-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fol. 1r'--></addSpan>destroyed them all. (that took place at the very time when my friend
