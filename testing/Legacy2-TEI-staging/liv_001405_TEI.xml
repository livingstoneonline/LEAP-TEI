<lb/><p rend="no-indent">but a steamer capable of stemming 
<lb/>the main current is necessary for 
<lb/>the ascent. The river is now <measure>15 feet</measure> 
<lb/>above low water mark in November 
<lb/>and as it is expected to rise considerably 
<lb/>more I felt inclined to take advantage 
<lb/>of it and haul this vessel through 
<lb/>but besides the risk of doubling her 
<lb/>up she can carry so little cargo 
<lb/>we would soon be without 
<lb/>supplies after we had succeeded. 
<lb/>We shall therefore work for a while 
<lb/>on this side the rapid - and as a 
<lb/>beginning I may mention that 
<lb/>we went up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> about the 
<lb/>beginning of <date when="1859-01">January</date> and found 
<lb/>it a good navigable river for 
<lb/>at least <measure>one hundred miles</measure> from 
<lb/>its confluence - The Mountain 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="mountain">Morambala</geogName></placeName> is <measure>4000 <choice><abbr>ft</abbr><expan>feet</expan></choice> high</measure> and 
<lb/>has a wonderfully <choice><sic>well cultivated</sic><corr>well-cultivated</corr></choice> 
<lb/>large top - <term type="plant"><term type="plant_foodstuff">Lemon</term> trees</term> grow quite 
<lb/>wild in the woods &amp; so do <term type="plant_foodstuff">oranges</term> 
<lb/>&amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff"><choice><sic>pine apples</sic><corr>pineapples</corr></choice></term>. There are several 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001405_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>fine little fountains with water slightly 
<lb/>chalybeate - the people independent &amp; 
<lb/>very hospitable. The view from the 
<lb/>top of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> winding across an 
<lb/>extended plain inhabited by real 
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="la"><orgName>Lotophagi</orgName></foreign> is magnificent and 
<lb/>as you may judge from the 
<lb/>height we have <seg type="weather">quite a different 
<lb/>climate from that of the plains</seg>
<lb/>The <term type="plant">vegetation</term> is very like that 
<lb/>of <placeName><region>Londa</region></placeName> &amp; <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName> - We have 
<lb/>also a fine hot sulphureous 
<lb/>fountain at the base (174°) yet 
<lb/>no advantage has been taken of 
<lb/>this splendid sanatorium by the 
<lb/><term type="people">Portguese</term> - The valley of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>at one part abounds in <term type="animal">Elephants</term> 
<lb/>and if you come to see us 
<lb/>about January I undertake to 
<lb/><add place="marginleft"><choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice></add> five hundred of these noble 
<lb/>animals grazing on one plain
<lb/>We saw more than that - and as 
<lb/>there are branches of the river which 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001405_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>form islands we sometimes chased 
<lb/>them with this vessel. They had 
<lb/>magnificent tusks - I think that they 
<lb/>are attracted down from the hills by 
<lb/>the sweet fruit of wild <term type="plant">Palmyras</term> of 
<lb/>which there are fine forests there. 
<lb/>The people were very suspicious 
<lb/>of us never having been visited 
<lb/>by <orgName>Europeans</orgName> before but treated 
<lb/>us civilly. Our wooding <orgName>parties</orgName> 
<lb/>were never molested - yet a 
<lb/><choice><sic>gaurd</sic><corr>guard</corr></choice> was set over us both night 
<lb/>and day. They are <choice><sic>well armed</sic><corr>well-armed</corr></choice>
<lb/>with bows and poisoned 
<lb/>arrows. The women insert an 
<lb/>ornament exactly the size and 
<lb/>shape of the rings for table napkins 
<lb/>into the upper lip - the effect 
<lb/>is frightful - It is a most unaccountable 
<lb/>ornament. They cultivate largely on 
<lb/>the upper third of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> <choice><sic>vally</sic><corr>valley</corr></choice>
<lb/>and we purchased abundance of 
<lb/>provisions at a cheap rate besides 
<lb/>specimens of their cotton &amp; cotton yarn

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001405_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
<lb/>They have two kinds of cotton <add place="above" rend="blue" hand="#hand01">GL:L30(4)</add> and 
<lb/>both very good in quality.</p>
<lb/><p>Our first object was to 
<lb/>gain their confidence and 
<lb/>seeing them so suspicious, 
<lb/>though we had pretty certain 
<lb/>information of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>becoming smooth again 
<lb/>beyond the cataract which 
<lb/>stopped our progress and 
<lb/>that <orgName>Arabs</orgName> from <placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>were in the habit of coming 
<lb/>down in canoes from 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Nyanja</geogName></placeName> we thought 
<lb/>it imprudent to leave the 
<lb/>vessel in their power 
<lb/>and go overland. We leave 
<lb/>them to allow our first 
<lb/>visit to have its effect 
<lb/>and in the course of a 
<lb/>month return to them again</p>

<cb rend="vertical"/><ab>
<lb/>I have got a portion of the Lord's prayer - &amp; <bibl>Ave Maria</bibl> from an 
<lb/>old blind woman. Another old lady here remembers the two black 
<lb/><term type="occupation">traders</term> coming here from <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName> on whom the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> lay their claims 
<lb/>for having crossed the continent - they never went to the coast so she says</ab><!-- geog: Africa -->

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001405_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">The reason why the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> 
<lb/>have not gone farther up than 
<lb/>about <placeName><geogName type="mountain">Morambala</geogName></placeName> is probably 
<lb/>the steady rapidity of the current 
<lb/>(<measure>2<choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> knots</measure>) there are no still 
<lb/>reaches and with the heavy <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> 
<lb/>canoes it is difficult to get on 
<lb/>in a current. The people too 
<lb/>have a bad name - they are 
<lb/>said to have killed some <orgName><orgName>native</orgName> 
<lb/><term type="occupation">traders</term></orgName>. In <date when="1856">1856</date> when I was 
<lb/>coming down past the mouth 
<lb/>of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> I was told that an 
<lb/><orgName>expedition</orgName> had been sent up 
<lb/>but was unable to go far because 
<lb/>the river was blocked up with 
<lb/><term type="plant">duckweed</term> - quantities of that were 
<lb/>then coming out of the river 
<lb/>but at <measure>25 miles</measure> from the 
<lb/>confluence the <term type="plant">duckweed</term> ceases 
<lb/>so the <orgName>Expedition</orgName> could not have 
<lb/><space extent="5" unit="words"/>gone far

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001405_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/>Above that the river widens a 
<lb/>little but it is free from sand banks 
<lb/>and deep. Indeed it may be said 
<lb/>to be superior to the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>for steam navigation. We could 
<lb/>go on at night even.</p>
<lb/><p>This is our most unhealthy 
<lb/>season. <term type="ailment">Fever</term> is fatal on 
<lb/>the coast. Here we have some 
<lb/>of it but no one dies in 
<lb/>consequence. Three of our 
<lb/><orgName>party</orgName> have had touches of it 
<lb/>but are better. This is the 
<lb/>edge of the high healthy lands 
<lb/>where I have still every reason 
<lb/>to believe that <orgName>Europeans</orgName> 
<lb/>might live in safety. We are 
<lb/>longing somewhat for news 
<lb/>having <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> none 
<lb/>except the <bibl>papers</bibl> you were 
<lb/>kind enough to send us by 
<lb/>the Lynx.</p>

<lb/><p>I have litle hopes of doing any good 
<lb/>with the people under or in contact with 
<lb/>the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> - A year or more must 
<lb/>elapse ere they recover from the 
<lb/>effects of their late war - but I think
