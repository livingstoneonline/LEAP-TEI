<lb/>that the <placeName><region>central parts of <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> south of the equator</region></placeName>
<lb/>though considerably elevated above the level of

<lb/>two oblong ridges on its <placeName><region>Eastern</region></placeName> and <placeName><region>Western</region></placeName> 
<lb/>sides - As suggestive of further enquiry 
<lb/>only, I may mention, though not pretending 
<lb/>to have examined the pretty extensive

<lb/><del type="strikethrough">being</del> down towards the centre of the country, 
<lb/>led to the conclusion, before I knew of the 
<lb/>existence of the ridges, - that <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> had,

<lb/>more energetically at the sides than at the

<lb/>been of the same nature as that which determined

<lb/>I am induced to make this suggestion, because
