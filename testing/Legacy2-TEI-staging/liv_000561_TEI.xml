<lb/><p>My Dear Friends</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/><space extent="3" unit="chars"/><!-- Anne, I added this second space to get it exactly in place. Adrian -->I sent off three <bibl>letters</bibl> for you about three 
<lb/>months ago and when I was in a sadly distressed state on account of 
<lb/>having suffered hurt in the jaws of a <term type="animal">lion</term>. About the time we 
<lb/>came here we were surrounded by an unusual number of <term type="animal">lions</term> 
<lb/>Many were killed but attacks continued to be made daily and the <orgName>natives</orgName> 
<lb/>were beginning to lose heart, and no sooner was it made known 
<lb/>that <term type="animal">cattle</term> had been killed during the night than all our work at the 
<lb/>water course was immediately suspended; Feeling vexed with these 
<lb/>misfortunes on one occasion when a <term type="animal">lion</term> killed 9 <term type="animal">sheep</term> on a 
<lb/>hill opposite our house I contrary to my usual custom went 
<lb/>with them in order to encourage them to put him to death and I 
<lb/>paid dearly for it for the <term type="animal">lion</term> on being wounded rushed down 
<lb/>upon and bit three of us badly, mine was worst for he broke 
<lb/>the left arm bone in several places &amp; twelve large gashes were 
<lb/>made some of them reaching down to the fractures. <persName>Mebaloe</persName>
<lb/>our <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">assistant</term> ran forward to rescue me but his gun 
<w>miss-<lb break="no"/>-ed</w> fire and he got severely wounded in the thigh. The <term type="animal">lion</term> then attacked 
<lb/>a <term type="tribe">makhatla</term> &amp; bit his shoulder but this was his last deed of 
<lb/>mischief for in doing so another <term type="tribe">makhatla</term> pitched a spear 
<lb/>into the monster's heart. <persName>Mebaloe</persName>'s wounds healed in about 
<lb/>a month after their infliction but mine were three before I could 
<lb/>use the arm in the least. I had a long trial of patience. Our 
<lb/>hut being quite unfinished the <orgName>natives</orgName> built me a hut and 
<lb/>in that hut I had many a wearisome day &amp; night - the wounds 
<lb/>discharged so excessively I was reduced to a mere skeleton and 
<lb/>had not strength to make the least movement on any couch 
<lb/>and not being able to secure the bones myself every motion 
<lb/>of the body caused them to grate on each other so as to prevent 
<lb/>union &amp; retard the healing of the wounds But through great
<lb/>mercy I have recovered well beyond my utmost expectation &amp; 
<lb/>my arm is both straight &amp; firm. It was a great affliction 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000561_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>But the Lord mingled much kindness with its severity and now 
<lb/>I can only praise him for his goodness &amp; sparing mercy. May 
<lb/>the spared life be devoted to the glory of my great Deliverer
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> are at present erecting new villages on 
<lb/>the site of the <orgName>mission</orgName> and we shall commence the erection 
<lb/>of a school immediately in order to have the power of 
<lb/>collecting both children &amp; adults in all weathers. We have 
<lb/>nothing of interest to relate respecting them. It is only midnight 
<lb/>gloom in their minds their affections are all on the earth 
<lb/>&amp; a thought never glances heavenward. But notwithstanding 
<lb/>their selfishness which is supreme I begin to love them more 
<lb/>than ever. I soon forgot to think of them as of a different 
<lb/>complexion and feel towards them as fellow immortals who 
<lb/>if they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> soon accept mercy must be lost eternally &amp; 
<lb/>O that they would but listen to the glad tidings. It would 
<lb/>satisfy them more thoroughly than all the world of goods. 
<lb/>We hear that the Lord is blessing his word at <placeName><settlement type="town">Lattakoo</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>twentythree were lately added to the church. I wish we could 
<lb/>say we saw even three beginning to think about their 
<lb/>souls &amp; eternity. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are degraded beyond conception 
<lb/>they seem to have sunk as far as human nature can - 
<lb/>there seem to exist some evidences of animal worship at 
<lb/>some former periods, as they are all called by some animal 
<lb/>thus for instance <del type="strikethrough">the</del> <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> literally translated is <hi rend="underline">they</hi> (of the) 
<lb/><hi rend="underline"><term type="animal">Fish</term></hi>, <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> <hi rend="underline">they</hi> (of the) <hi rend="underline"><term type="animal">Crocodile</term></hi>, <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> <hi rend="underline">they</hi> of 
<lb/>the <hi rend="underline"><term type="animal">monkey</term></hi>, <term type="tribe">Bachu√©ne</term>, they of the <term type="animal">Baboon</term>. While 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Barolongs</term> if asked by what they swear invariably 
<lb/>answer "we dance to iron". And in <term type="occupation">hunting</term> if they happen 
<lb/>to kill a <term type="animal">khoodoo</term> a magnificent animal of the <term type="animal">antelope</term> 
<lb/>species always make loud lamentations before they 
<lb/>begin to <del type="strikethrough"><unclear cert="low">skin</unclear></del> flay it as "yo yo yo we have killed our Father 
<lb/>yo yo yo &amp;c &amp;c, believing if they neglect this some of their 
<lb/>number will die in consequence. All the other tribes swear 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000561_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>by the animal after which they are called, never kill or eat 
<lb/>it &amp; sometimes <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> even look at it, saying that animal 
<lb/>is the friend of their race But if I am not wrong in my 
<lb/>conjecture even this form of worship has degenerated so 
<lb/>that now only the vestiges remain &amp; all their affections are 
<lb/>given to the gratification of earthly propensities O that the 
<lb/>Holy spirit may work mightily on these dark minds &amp; turn 
<lb/>them from the service of their lusts to the pure service of 
<lb/>the Great God of Heaven &amp; of earth</p>
<lb/><p>Of all the seeds you gave me none vegetated except the 
<term type="plant"><w>sun-<lb break="no"/>flower</w></term> and now it is planted at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>, the reason of the 
<lb/>deficiency of vegetative power I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know perhaps it was 
<lb/>sea air that destroyed it. I long much for an opportunity 
<lb/>to send you a box, but all my endeavours have as yet been 
<lb/>in vain. We have <term type="nationality">chinese</term> <term type="plant_foodstuff">oats</term> without <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">any</add> husk and 
<lb/><term type="nationality">Egyptian</term> <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> (a few grains of it were once <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> 
<lb/>me by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pyne</persName> grows well. It being better adapted 
<lb/>for boiling than the <orgName>Bengal</orgName> <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> we have it <del type="strikethrough">planted</del> sown 
<lb/>yearly. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here are other things which might be of use if I 
<lb/>could only get them sent. I shall however still be 
<lb/>on the look out &amp; hope I shall yet succeed.</p>
<lb/><p>Hoping soon to hear from you I shall conclude this
