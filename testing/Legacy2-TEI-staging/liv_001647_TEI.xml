<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>My Dear Sir George</p><!-- persName: Sir George Grey -->
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space extent="13" unit="chars"/>You will probably have 
<lb/>heard ere this reaches you that we went 
<lb/>to the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> in <date when="1861-02">February</date> and made 
<lb/>an attempt to ascend that river in <date when="1861-03">March</date>. 
<lb/>Our progress was arrested when only some 
<lb/><measure>thirty miles</measure> from the mouth by observing 
<lb/>that the water was falling at the rate of <measure>seven 
<lb/>inches</measure> a day; we had come over some 
<lb/>parts not more than <measure>five or six feet deep</measure> 
<lb/>and our vessel was drawing <measure>four &amp; a half 
<lb/>feet</measure> so we had to make up our minds 
<lb/>whether to proceed further and remain among 
<lb/>a people whom we do not know till next 
<lb/>flood, or come back and work on our 
<lb/>old "spoor" up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> - The detention 
<lb/>would have been such a waste of time 
<lb/>for those who remained at <placeName><geogName type="island">Johanna</geogName></placeName>, &amp; 
<lb/>would not have advanced the objects 
<lb/>of those who had come to <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> more 
<lb/>effectually than by spending the same 
<lb/>period up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> = For the general 
<lb/>good therefore we returned and were 
<lb/>favoured by a rise in the river of 
<lb/><measure>three or four feet</measure> - this last is said 
<lb/>to be the last flood of the year, And 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001647_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>made us fully alive to the fact that 
<lb/>from one cause or another we were 
<lb/>quite two months too late for successful 
<lb/>exploration.</p>
<lb/><p>From the little that we saw we are 
<lb/>disposed to think favourably of the river 
<lb/>as an entrance into <placeName><region>Eastern <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName></region></placeName> - It 
<lb/>has a sandy bottom <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above"><measure>three quarters of a mile broad</measure></add> and partakes much 
<lb/>of the character of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> - Unlike 
<lb/>that river with its abominable bars, 
<lb/>it flows into a magnificent bay - and 
<lb/>the only danger in its <measure>mile wide</measure> mouth 
<lb/>is a sort of "bore" formed by the 
<lb/>water of the river of <measure>a few fathoms</measure> 
<lb/>meeting the ocean tide of <measure>nineteen fathoms</measure>. 
<lb/>At full tide it is all smooth - By keeping 
<lb/>near the shore it is quite safe at all 
<lb/>periods of the tide - We have a very 
<lb/>short delta and the land rises up from 
<lb/>the banks in a gentle slope to <measure>300 or 400 
<lb/>feet</measure> - It is well wooded the ebony 
<lb/>attaining a much larger size than it 
<lb/>does anywhere on the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> - The 
<lb/>country is very beautiful but there is 
<lb/>something wrong among the people - 
<lb/>Food seemed scarce in a soil where 
<lb/>everything could grow - <orgName>Half caste <orgName>Arabs</orgName></orgName> 
<lb/>appear to lord it over the general population 
<lb/>and they were inclined to do the same 
<lb/>with us. When my brother took the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> 
<lb/>on shore to cut wood some of them came 
<lb/>and assumed the airs we read of in 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001647_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><choice><sic>in</sic><corr/></choice> countries further <placeName><region>North</region></placeName>. They demanded 
<lb/>payment for the wood and he offered to 
<lb/>give it provided that they should cut it. 
<lb/>But no, they would seize that already cut, 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> were unarmed but made 
<lb/>a rush to their arms - "They would not 
<lb/>let their <orgName>white men</orgName> be imposed on" the 
<lb/>bastards made a rush the other way, 
<lb/>and could scarcely be prevailed on to 
<lb/>come back and take up the <term type="plant">vegetables</term> 
<lb/>they had left behind - But for this little 
<lb/><choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> of pluck we should have had the 
<lb/>company of these <orgName>half castes</orgName> at every 
<lb/>village - fines levied on every possible 
<lb/>pretext - and the word passed on beyond 
<lb/>their beat, that we were a <orgName>herd of she asses</orgName> 
<lb/>to be milked for the public benefit - It is 
<lb/>of the utmost importance here, as in <placeName><bloc>Europe</bloc></placeName> 
<lb/>for the people to feel that you are not dependant 
<lb/>on them - If they see that you can get on 
<lb/>without them they are much more obliging 
<lb/>You could not have done a wiser deed 
<lb/>than give my friend <persName>Captain Speke</persName> the 
<lb/><orgName>Hottentot</orgName> <term type="occupation"><choice><sic>gaurd</sic><corr>guard</corr></choice></term> - If they <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">continue stead fast and</add> escape <term type="ailment">fever</term>, 
<lb/>which is rather doubtful as <orgName>people of colour</orgName> 
<lb/>are as liable to it as <orgName>whites</orgName>, his opinion 
<lb/>of the general population will be raised 
<lb/>about 300 per cent - I have always 
<lb/>found that the presence of a trusty <orgName>band 
<lb/>of <term type="tribe">Makololo</term></orgName> - though useless for ship 
<lb/>work, was invaluable on land - It 
<lb/>was not without considerable regret 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001647_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>that we gave up the project of a land 
<lb/>journey with them up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName>. 
<lb/>It was the worst season for travelling - 
<lb/><seg type="weather">rain, and heavy dews would have 
<lb/>cut us up</seg>. In fact the same reasons 
<lb/>that prevailed for the postponement 
<lb/>of the landing of the <orgName>Mission</orgName> still <w>con-
<lb break="no"/>-tinued</w> in force - By the time we reach 
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> we shall be in the healthier 
<lb/>season, and a beginning will be made 
<lb/>of the general labours from the other 
<lb/>end of <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> to that which we looked 
<lb/>on by the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> - It is curious 
<lb/>that all the people declare that <del type="strikethrough">Ny</del> <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>comes out of <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> - This, according to 
<lb/>a curious idea that has come over the 
<lb/>geographical mind in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>, must 
<lb/>mean that <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> comes out <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">of</add> <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>I wish our good friends would only 
<lb/>tell us all about it beforehand - It would 
<lb/>save us a great deal of trouble - and 
<lb/>deliver us from the perplexity of guessing 
<lb/>and - grumbling - We see for instance 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> never discolours in flood - but is 
<lb/>always of a dark mossy hue = carries 
<lb/>a great deal of mica, <add place="above">has a muddy bottom</add> and never rises 
<lb/>or falls more than <measure>a few feet</measure> - <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> 
<lb/>rises some <measure>five or six feet</measure> - is very brown 
<lb/>&amp; muddy, but has a sandy bottom - water 
<lb/>carries little or no mica - and tastes of 
<lb/>rain rather than moss. Now anything positive 
<lb/>if given beforehand will be thankfully <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>though it comes from the <bibl>Archives of <persName>Prester John</persName></bibl></p>

<lb/>might be a proper person

<lb/>as we expect them to meet 
<lb/>us by a man of war which 
<lb/>we beg may be sent to meet 
<lb/>us at <placeName><geogName type="river">Kongone</geogName></placeName> on the <date when="1862-01-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>
<lb/>January 1862</date> - We shall not, 
<lb/>indeed cannot return to the

<lb/><p>If a small steamer we 
<lb/>expect comes before that 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001647_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/>and the <choice><sic>bishops</sic><corr>bishop's</corr></choice> sisters should <!-- persName: Bishop Mackenzie -->
<lb/>wish to come by that opportunity 
<lb/>I shall be glad if you instruct 
<lb/>the person in charge to afford 
<lb/>every facility to any one <w>con-
<lb break="no"/>nected</w> with the <orgName>mission</orgName> in his 
<lb/>power - either by coming up 
<lb/>to the Pioneer at <placeName>Chibisa's</placeName>
<lb/>or <placeName><geogName type="island">Dakanamoio island</geogName></placeName> and 
<lb/>offloading, then returning for 
<lb/>all their luggage or acting in 
<lb/>anyway that may seem most 
<lb/>serviceable to the general interests - 
<lb/>I should like now to see my own 
<lb/>wife appear on the scene but 
<lb/>we have a tough bit of work 
<lb/>in getting up a boat and examining 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> - and <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> as the 
<lb/>Anatomical <term type="occupation">lecturers</term> say "from above

<lb/><p>About the <term type="animal">mules</term> I sometimes 
<lb/>think a <term type="animal">horse</term> &amp; <term type="animal">mare</term> for breeding 
<lb/>purposes might be preferable but 
<lb/>we might stumble into <term type="insect">tsetse</term> and then 
<lb/>everybody will say "why we knew that" 
<lb/>"I told you so."</p>

<lb/><p>I propose to submit a spot near 
<lb/>the village marked "<placeName><settlement type="village"><persName>Chizunze</persName>'s</settlement></placeName>" not 
<lb/>far from the bottom of <placeName><geogName type="mountain">Zomba</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>for the bishop's inspection - the <!-- persName: Bishop Mackenzie -->
<lb/><term type="occupation">headman</term> called <persName>Chibaba</persName> is a 
<lb/>fat frank jolly fellow - the 
<lb/>elevation some <measure>3000 or 4000 
<lb/>feet</measure> above the sea, <seg type="weather">cool in the 
<lb/>hottest part of the season</seg>, and 
<lb/><choice><sic>well watered</sic><corr>well-watered</corr></choice>. This will be a

<lb/><placeName><geogName type="mountain">Zomba</geogName></placeName>'s top <measure>a day's journey</measure> up - 
<lb/>inhabited - and a fine rivulet - 
<lb/>If they become sick there they had 
<lb/>better make their wills at once 
<lb/>and not bother the <term type="occupation">doctors</term> - some 
<lb/>work will be required to find a 
<lb/>good sloping <unclear cert="medium">kloof</unclear> up to the 
<lb/>first Plateau. All have had 
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever</term> except one. Indeed but two 
<lb/><add place="above">of the entire <orgName>Expedition</orgName></add> have escaped yet nothing serious 
<lb/>occurred -</p>
<lb/><p>You remember when every <bibl><placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>
<lb/>Paper</bibl> contained the great Word 
<lb/>"<persName>Mazzepa</persName>" - From flaring in print 
<lb/>she has come down to carrying 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001647_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'-->
<lb/><orgName>slaves</orgName>. We found her here with sixty 
<lb/>on board bought at <placeName><settlement type="town">Kilwa</settlement></placeName> (<placeName><settlement type="town">Quiloa</settlement></placeName>) on 
<lb/>the <placeName><region>East Coast</region></placeName> at 22 dollars per head 
<lb/>then - the owner gave 250 dollars to 
<lb/>a <term type="occupation">chief</term> on <placeName><geogName type="island">Comoro island</geogName></placeName> to furnish 
<lb/>him with certificate that the <orgName>slaves</orgName> 
<lb/>were his own people lent as <orgName>free 
<lb/>emigrants</orgName> - It is here scarcely thought 
<lb/>necessary to conceal the nature of these 
<lb/>transactions - there is constant intercourse 
<lb/>between the islands &amp; the <term type="occupation">chief</term> is rather 
<lb/>admired for the amount he extracted, 
<lb/>but the <orgName><term type="nationality">French</term> Government</orgName> <term type="occupation">Official</term> 
<lb/>is on board and it is illegal to
