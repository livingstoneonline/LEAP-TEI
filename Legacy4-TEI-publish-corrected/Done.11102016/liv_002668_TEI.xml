<lb/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My dear <persName>Sir Bartle</persName>
<lb/><space extent="3" unit="words"/>When I wrote to 
<lb/>you to in February 1867, I had 
<lb/>the impression that I was 
<lb/>then on the watershed 
<lb/>between the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> &amp; either 
<lb/>the <placeName>Congo</placeName> or <del type="strikethrough">the</del><placeName>Nile</placeName>. Further 
<lb/>observation now leads me 
<lb/>to believe that impression to 
<lb/>have been correct, &amp; from 
<lb/>what I have myself seen, 
<lb/>together with what I have 
<lb/>heard from intelligent 
<lb/>natives - I think that I can 
<lb/>safely assert that the chief 
<lb/>sources of the <placeName>Nile</placeName> rise between 
<lb/>10° and 12° South Latitude: 
<lb/>or nearly in the position 
<lb/>assigned to them by <persName>Ptolomy</persName>
<lb/>whose river <placeName>Bhapta</placeName> is 
<lb/>probably the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>. I 
<lb/>cannot yet speak positively 
<lb/>of the parts West &amp; N.N. West 
<lb/>of <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> because 
<lb/>these have not yet come 
<lb/>under my observation 
<lb/>but if you will read the 
<lb/>following short sketch of 
<lb/>what I have seen you

<lb/>will see that the springs 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Nile</placeName> have hitherto 
<lb/>been sought for very much 
<lb/>too far to the North. </p>
<lb/><p>Leaving the valley of the 
<lb/><placeName>Loangwa</placeName> at 12° South we climbed 
<lb/>up what seemed to be a great 
<lb/>map of mountains, but it 
<lb/>turned out to be the southern 
<lb/>edge of an elevated region 
<lb/>the height of which is from 
<lb/>4000 to 6000 feet above the 
<lb/>level of the sea - this upland 
<lb/>may be roughly said to 
<lb/>cover a space south of <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Tanganyika</placeName> of some 350 
<lb/>miles square - It is generally 
<lb/>covered with dense forest - 
<lb/>has an undulating surface - 
<lb/>a rich soil - is well watered 
<lb/>with numerous rivulets, &amp; 
<lb/>for <placeName>Africa</placeName> is cold. It slopes 
<lb/>towards the North &amp; West but 
<lb/>I have not seen any part 
<lb/>of it under 3000 feet of 
<lb/>altitude - The country of 
<lb/><placeName>Usango</placeName> situated East of 
<lb/>the space indicated is 
<lb/>also an upland and affords 
<lb/>pasturage for the immense 
<lb/>herds of the cattle of the <term type="tribe">Basango</term>
<lb/>(Wasango of the Arabs) a 
<lb/>very light coloured race very 
<lb/>friendly with strangers. 
<lb/><placeName>Usango</placeName> forms one the eastern

<lb/>side of the southern end of 
<lb/>a great but still elevated 
<lb/>valley. The other or Western 
<lb/>side is formed by what are 
<lb/>called the Kone mountains 
<lb/>beyond the copper mines of 
<lb/><placeName>Katanga</placeName>. - Still further West 
<lb/>&amp; beyond the Kone Range or 
<lb/>plateau rises our old acquaintance 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> by the name 
<lb/><placeName>Zambaji</placeName>. Referring back 
<lb/>to 12° South - It was rarely 
<lb/>possible to obtain even a 
<lb/>latitude but accidentally 
<lb/>awaking one morning 
<lb/>after we were fairly on 
<lb/>the upland I found a 
<lb/>star which shewed lat. 11° 
<lb/>56′ south - and next day 
<lb/>we crossed two rivulets 
<lb/>running North - As we 
<lb/>advanced brooks became 
<lb/>numerous - some went 
<lb/>backwards or sideways into 
<lb/>the <placeName>Loangwa</placeName> &amp; with it to join 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> at <placeName>Zumbo</placeName> - 
<lb/>but the greatest number went 
<lb/>North or Nor-West into 
<lb/>the river <placeName>Chambeze</placeName>. This, misled 
<lb/>by a map calling it an 
<lb/>offhand manner "<hi rend="underline"><placeName>Zambesi, 
<lb/>Eastern branch</placeName></hi>" - I took to 
<lb/>be the river so indicated 
<lb/>but the <placeName>Chambeze</placeName> with

<lb/>the side into the centre of 
<lb/>the great <placeName>Nile</placeName> valley - It is 
<lb/>remarkable as helping to form 
<lb/>three lakes and changing 
<lb/>its name three times in 
<lb/>the 500 or 600 miles of its 
<lb/>course - First of all it is 
<lb/>the <placeName>Chambeze</placeName> which I 
<lb/>crossed in 10° 34′ south - 
<lb/>I crossed several of its 
<lb/>confluents both on its South 
<lb/>&amp; North quite as large as 
<lb/>the <placeName>Isis</placeName> at <placeName>Oxford</placeName> but running 
<lb/>faster &amp; having hippopotami 
<lb/>in them. I mention these 
<lb/>animals because when 
<lb/>navigating the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>I steered always boldly on 
<lb/>to where these beasts lay 
<lb/>sure of never finding less 
<lb/>than eight feet of water - 
<lb/>The <placeName>Chambeze</placeName> flows into 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Bangweolo</placeName>, &amp; on 
<lb/>coming out of it assumes

<lb/>flows down north past the 
<lb/>town of <placeName>Cazembe</placeName> and then 
<lb/>enters <placeName>Lake Moero</placeName>. On emerging 
<lb/>from it the name <placeName>Lualaba</placeName>
<lb/>is taken. In passing on N. 
<lb/>N. West it becomes very 
<lb/>large and forms <placeName>Wenge</placeName> in 
<lb/>the country West of 
<lb/><placeName>Tanganyika</placeName>. 
<lb/>I have seen it only where it

<lb/>the mountains of <placeName>Rua</placeName> &amp; where 
<lb/>it comes out again and am 
<lb/>sure it is sufficient to form 
<lb/><placeName>Wenge</placeName> whether it is a Lake 
<lb/>with many islands in it 
<lb/>or a Punjaub if I may use 
<lb/>the word before the waters 
<lb/>are all gathered up by the 
<lb/><placeName>Lupira</placeName> a large river which 
<lb/>drains the Western side 
<lb/>of the great valley and having 
<lb/>its sources between 11° and 12° S. 
<lb/>Beyond <placeName>Wenge</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Wenge </placeName>itself 
<lb/>is purely native information,

<lb/>when <placeName>Lupira</placeName> takes it up 
<lb/>it flows N.N.W. into a 
<lb/>large lake named <placeName>Chowambe</placeName>
<lb/>which I conjecture to be that

<lb/>others think that it goes

<lb/>by river named <placeName>Loanda</placeName>. 
<lb/>I suspend my judgment

<lb/>amount of water I have 
<lb/>seen going North does 
<lb/>not flow past <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Tanganyika</placeName> on the West 
<lb/>it must have an exit &amp;

<lb/>Went North intending to go 
<lb/>to <placeName>Ujiji</placeName> for goods &amp; letters 
<lb/>not having heard a word 
<lb/>of any kind from anywhere 
<lb/>for two years, but I was 
<lb/>brought to a stand at a 
<lb/>distance of thirteen <add place="above">days</add> from 
<lb/><placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> by the 
<lb/>superabundance of water 
<lb/>in the country in front. 
<lb/>A native party came through 
<lb/>&amp; described the waters as 
<lb/>often thigh &amp; waste deep 
<lb/>and sleeping places difficult 
<lb/>to find. This inundation 
<lb/>lasts till May or June. When

<lb/>on my course to <placeName>Cazembe</placeName>
<lb/>in April and that you 
<lb/>may understand the 
<lb/>nature of the flood that 
<lb/>here annually enacts the 
<lb/>part of the <placeName>Nile</placeName> further

<lb/>two rivulets each from 
<lb/>30 to 40 yards broad flow 
<lb/>into the North end of <placeName>Moero</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>One had a quarter and the 
<lb/>other half a mile of flood

<lb/>and we had four hours of 
<lb/>plunging in waters &amp; black 
<lb/>mud. The last mile was 
<lb/>the worst though the rest 
<lb/>had many deep ruts into 
<lb/>which from not seeing 
<lb/>them we plunged and 
<lb/>sent up a rush of hundreds 
<lb/>of bubbles to the surface 
<lb/>all charged with a frightful 
<lb/>odour. Before getting out 
<lb/>to the clean sandy beach 
<lb/>of <placeName>Moero</placeName> the flood water 
<lb/>was up high on the chest. 
<lb/>Then we had to wade 4 
<lb/>brooks thigh deep - cross a 
<lb/>river 80 yards broad with 
<lb/>300 yards of flood on 
<lb/>its Western bank so deep 
<lb/>we had to keep to the
