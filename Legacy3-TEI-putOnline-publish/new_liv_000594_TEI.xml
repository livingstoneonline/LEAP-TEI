<lb/><p>My dear Father</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/>As <persName>Apie</persName> leaves tomorrow I begin
<lb/>another hurried scrawl. For the first time in my
<lb/>life I feel that my hands are really full. Too
<lb/>many irons in the fire over head &amp; ears and the
<lb/>rain will come I have no doubt. I came here
<lb/>last friday week &amp; after a fortnight<supplied cert="high">'</supplied>s sojourn
<lb/>intend to leave on thursday or friday next, my
<lb/>window frames must be done then. I am now
<lb/>busy at them. When the first row of thatch
<lb/>is on "I shall sleep a month" The <bibl>letter to
<lb/>the <orgName>Directors</orgName></bibl> is not finished &amp; lies like an
<lb/>incubus on my mind. I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> make it
<lb/>to please myself. Tired out every night
<lb/>I fancy I feel like you in your <w>per-
<lb break="no"/>petual</w> bustle. I have been in bustles
<lb/>frequently but never felt as now But
<lb/>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> by the above ask help either
<lb/>sideways or anyways. I just speak
<lb/>as I feel. The more we toil here the
<lb/>sweeter rest will be. Let us look to
<lb/>the Heavenly rest &amp; peace with more
<lb/>intense desires. <persName>Mary</persName> I suppose will
<lb/>give all the news I have none</p>

<lb/>they talked frequently about <persName>Edwards</persName>. We
<lb/>could with difficulty answer their questions
<lb/>they were so pointed. But we avoided saying

<lb/>has not however observed the same rule

<lb/>Whether he has done anything or not when last 
<lb/>here or whether it is merely the effect of
<lb/>knowing that we shall leave, the people
<lb/>now <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> turn out to the meetings. We
<lb/>have not a quarter of the former number
<lb/>so I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> feel bound to remain here longer
<lb/>than I can help. Before his visit
<lb/>the house was generally quite full, since then
<lb/>we have scarcely ever <choice><orig>⅓</orig><reg>1/3</reg></choice> of the former number
<lb/>The only relaxation we have is half an
<lb/>hour in the garden before sun set <w>trans-
<lb break="no"/>-planting</w>. <persName>Mary</persName> is a real <term type="occupation">gardener</term> &amp; enjoys
<lb/>this much when not too tired. She is
<lb/>wonderfully well. We have had some
<lb/>dishes of <term type="plant_foodstuff"><term type="nationality">Scotch</term> Kale</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">spinach</term>, leaves
<lb/>of <term type="plant_foodstuff">Mangold Wurzil</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">carrots</term> an inch in

<lb/>&amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff">broccoli</term> &amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff">cabbages</term> &amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff">turnips</term> ad nauseum
<lb/>endure in abundance but we <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know
<lb/>how to eat all our good things. Perhaps
<lb/>I shall turn out a half <term type="occupation">gardener</term> at my

<lb/>the <unclear cert="medium">diel</unclear> at sinning. I like it very much
<lb/>Many thanks for the <term type="plant">vine</term> cuttings. When you

<lb/>Send out some <term type="plant_foodstuff">oats</term> &amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff">barley</term> from <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>The latter is perhaps superior, the former may
