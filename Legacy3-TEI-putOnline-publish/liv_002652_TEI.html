<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>In spite of the interest 
<br/>employed in our behalf by the Royal Society 
<br/>and the intentions of Government 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Laird</span> furnished us with a most 
<br/>wretched vessel, and I am sorry to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>inform you that our magnetic 
<br/>instruments have lately suffered 
<br/>severely in consequence. the 
<br/>vessel was built of a sort of 
<br/>Patent steel plate of only 1/16 of an 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>inch in thickness. It is excessively 
<br/>hard - friction has no effect 
<br/>upon it, but moisture &amp; heat 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>produce a chemical decomposition 
<br/>from which paint is no protection. 
<br/>Scales apparently of the black oxide 
<br/>of iron are formed inside &amp; out 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and when these are peeled off there 
<br/>is a black smooth shining surface 
<br/>with numerous small holes. the 
<br/>scales are strongly magnetic, and 
<br/>I think that they have damaged the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>magnetism of the instruments. The 
<br/>moisture consequent on the scaling 
<br/>off, and wet from springing 
<br/>of leaks in plates now not 
<br/>1/32 of an inch in thickness 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>have destroyed the glue in 
<br/>the wooden parts, so much 
<br/>that a new set would be 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>the only really satisfactory 
<br/>remedy. You may be 
<br/>sure that <span class="">my brother</span>
<br/>will do the best that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>he can in the circumstances 
<br/>by regluing &amp;c. but I 
<br/>think it my duty to let 
<br/>you know exactly how 
<br/>matters stand. We hope 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>for a new vessel with 
<br/>room for instruments &amp; 
<br/>collections. In this we have 
<br/><span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span><span class="add small inspace">&amp; much private &amp; public property has been</span>
<br/><span class="add small below">spoiled</span> neither. and she has been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>so put together as to pump 
<br/>water into herself by her own 
<br/>proper motions. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Macgregor

<br/>Laird</span> promised <span class="underline ">before</span> we got her 
<br/>that she would carry ten or twelve 
<br/>tons. His brother cooly says 
<br/><span class="underline ">after</span> we got her, that she 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>was intended to carry only a 
<br/>very few persons. As far 
<br/>as discovery is concerned we 
<br/>have done pretty well, but 
<br/>all our operations have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>been cramped by this wretched 
<br/>vessel, and it is a wonder 
<br/>we have escaped with our 
<br/>lives.</p>
