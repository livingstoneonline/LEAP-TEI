<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>a short one it proved quite a reviving draught in this thirsty land &amp; this not so 
<br/>much by what it contained as by the flood of pleasing recollections it made 
<br/>whirl through my mind. I intended writing you from <span class="">Cape Town</span> &amp; I assure you 
<br/>nothing prevented me fulfilling that intention but a strange fatuity which 
<br/>seized me there &amp; made me really believe I should meet you there, We 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>were a long time on the passage in consequence of having been obliged to put into 
<br/><span class="">Rio De Janiero</span> &amp; after coming to <span class="">Cape Town</span> we had to wait a month for 
<br/>our vessel unloading at <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Limon">Limon's</span> Bay</span>. I did not regret going into <span class="">Rio</span>
<br/>It is certainly the finest place I ever saw. Everything delighted me except 
<br/>man. Even the "church Establishment" there is beautiful. They really do 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the things in style there. If even I form an Establishment it <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> be either 
<br/>of the poor degenerate "sisters" at home but the good mother herself in <span class="">Brazil</span>
<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">But</span> I must be very concise or I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> be able to give you even the heads of <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">the</span>
<br/>discourse I have so much to say <span class="add  above">to</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> you. [I secured a series of letters "on the status
<br/>&amp; prospects of the <span class="">Brazilian Empire</span> for the <span class="">Scottish Cong.Assy.</span> by an American 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Episcopal methodist missionary there, a good sort of fellow, once a 
<br/>chaplain in the <span class="">American Navy</span> &amp; [devoid of the characteristic cant of <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">of</span>Engl.
<br/>Wesleyans]. We lived in his home during our sojourn. I think you would 
<br/>have liked him. Alas he is the only protestant near I in <span class="">Brazil</span> &amp; all sects 
<br/>are tolerated. He can however do a little in the way of rooting out ignorance 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Tracts</span> &amp; <span class="">bibles</span> are circulated &amp; some efforts might be expected were a most 
<br/>injurious influence not exercised by <span class="">European</span> visitors. These alone disgrace 
<br/>the members of the religion they profess by drunkeness. All other vices are common 
<br/>in <span class="">Rio</span>. When will the beams of divine light dispel the darkness of the beautiful 
<br/>Empire? The climate is delightful, I wonder if disabled Indian missionaries 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>could not make themselves useful there]?</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We left <span class="">Algoa Bay</span> on the <span class="">20<span class="sup ">th</span> may</span> &amp; still we are <span class="">a month</span> from <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>We crossed the <span class="">Orange</span> 10 days ago at a rather difficult ford near <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">hillappoba</span></span>
<br/>in navigating my ponderous vehicle through the stream I got aground &amp; 
<br/>my oxen got "reel ral" some with their heads where their tails should be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>&amp; others with their heads twisted round in the yoke so far they appeared bent 
<br/>on committing suicide or overturning the waggon.  In this predicament 
<br/>I was glad to see an acquaintance of yours approaching from the other 
<br/>bank to my assistance. It was no other than "<span class="">Sedras</span>" who fortunately 
<br/>came to the ford on his way to <span class="">Colesberg</span> to buy goods with £10 he has 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>scraped together somehow. He is a smart fellow &amp; decidedly the best 
<br/>spearman of Bechuanas I have seen - I like travelling very much indeed 
<br/>there is so much freedom connected with our <span class="">African</span> manners. We pitch our 
<br/>tent, make our fire &amp;c, wherever we choose, walk, ride or shoot at abundance 
<br/>of all sorts of game as our inclination leads us. but there is a great drawback

<br/>be furnished with the means of making known the truth of the gospel</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I was introduced by <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Phillip</span> to the Colonial Sec<span class="sup ">y</span> &amp; the "cases" were promptly ordered 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>I found three of them but most unfortunately an error in packing has caused the 
<br/>destruction of many of the glass vessels. I hope however to have as many as make 
<br/>one complete &amp; if so I may say from what I have seen of the animals of this country 
<br/>it would be difficult to make it of some value to <span class="">Mr Owen</span> - I saw many 
<br/>specimens of agatized wood in the bed of the <span class="">Orange</span>, the concentric rings beautifully 
<br/><span class="linenumber">55</span>distinct &amp; the pith chrystalized regularly &amp; as clear as crystal. but the edges of the 
<br/>chrystals were mostly rubbed off by friction amongst other stones - In a plane about 
<br/><span class="">50 miles</span> from the river I passed an entire tree completely agatized &amp; retaining so 
<br/>much of the original appearance I took it at first for real wood - It was 
<br/>broken into blocks of about a foot &amp; a half in length. I took <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: pieces">peices</span> of it but I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">60</span>must not begin to describe all or any of the wonders I have seen. Any book 
<br/>of travels will supply with wonders ad infinitum?</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The missions on this side  the river are in a sad state. Every man's hand 
<br/>is against his neighbour.  Whatever may have been the original cause of

<br/>I confess I feel very differently on the subject of the D<span class="sup ">r</span>s superintendance now 
<br/>but you must not imagine I am in the least changed in my senses 
<br/>respecting thorough going independancy, the burden of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> &amp; M<span class="sup ">rs</span>Moffat</span>'s    
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>soup to me was always derogatory to the character of D<span class="sup ">r</span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> P.</span>. This filled in 
<br/>with prejudice against the latter. A month's residence in their house during 
<br/>which time I had sufficient opportunities of scrutinizing their characters, has 
<br/>completely dissolved the whole of it.  With respect to his superintendance, he 
<br/>told me he never had considered himself as anything more than the money 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>agent of the <span class="">Society</span>. With spiritual affairs or modes of operation he had 
<br/>nothing to do &amp; never wished to interfere in these matters but he had been 
<br/>frequently compelled by the <span class="">Society</span> referring disputes to his decision to act a part 
<br/>he had no intention to, for generally one party was dissatisfied &amp; he came 
<br/>his calumniator.  He may have domineered in some instances but <span class="">Mr 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>M.</span> is I understand not the man who would cast the first stone- The D<span class="sup ">r</span> is now 
<br/>in his dotage &amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> do any more harm but were he in his vigour I should 
<br/>greatly prefer the despotism of <span class="underline ">one</span> to that of the many. The later <span class="">Mr M.</span> seems 
<br/>bent on establishing &amp; my poor neighbour here seems delighted with the idea 
<br/>of having a "<span class="underline "><span class="">Presbytery</span></span>" I hope <span class="">Griffith</span> is a staunch <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Independent">Independant</span></span>, you see the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>part I must act. The present system is real liberty compared <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">with</span> committeeocracy 
<br/>I feel I am giving you a very partial view of the subject It would take a days talk 
<br/>to explain the whole subject. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> fully explain the Colonial feeling. It is 
<br/>some what like caste in <span class="">India</span>. <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Phillip</span> has been the staunch advocate of the 
<br/><span class="">coloured</span> population. There is a strong feeling amongst the <span class="">Colonists</span> against <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">the</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>him &amp; them &amp; strange to say most of the D<span class="sup ">rs</span> enemies have imbibed it. I mean 
<br/>of the missionaries. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> say all but all I have seen certainly have- They 
<br/>divide into radicals &amp; conservatives. They have not these names but it is of 
<br/>that nature.  <span class="underline ">You</span> would be a friend of the natives you would plead their cause 
<br/>against the <span class=""><span class="">boors</span></span>, I know you would for I know your feelings on that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>subject and from this I conclude you would take sides with the D<span class="sup ">r</span> &amp; his friends 
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> help feeling friendly to him when I think of all he has done in the cause 
<br/>of liberty &amp; when he tells me distinctly that he will not interfere at all in my 
<br/>operations, that he wishes all the miss<span class="sup ">s</span> to follow their own plans for these 
<br/>are generally the most efficient that they <span class="add  above">as</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> individuals can employ - [every one

<br/>agent, the person who pays my salary on demand Why should I wish a 
<br/>change of affairs on the ground of the quarrels of another man? Whether it 
<br/>has been from the spirit of opposition that <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> has imbibed the Coloni
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>feeling I know not but certainly he had a good quantity of it while here &amp; 
<br/>of course was a favorite with the <span class=""><span class="">boors</span></span> But he found no Colonial feelin
<br/>in <span class="">England</span>. He spoke out just in the same strain that <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> P.</span> always has done 
<br/>his speeches are full of affection to the <span class="">African</span> &amp; it appears he says som<br/>thing about the <span class=""><span class="">boors</span></span> in connection with the <span class="">African</span>. The speeches most 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>unfortunately have found their way to this country &amp; have given morta
<br/>offence to the <span class="">Colonists</span>- They see he is a turncoat &amp; are greatly enraged 
<br/>with him- <span class="">The Ghram's Town Journal</span>. (conducted by the Wesleyans) another 
<br/>"Watchman" has made known his inconsistency with joy. Altogether I sho
<br/>not like to be in <span class="">Mr M</span>s place when he returns. Instead of being the pet of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">illiberals</span> on account of his opposition to the D<span class="sup ">r</span>. He will now be received 
<br/>with suspicion by both parties.  There was a great deal of sound sense &amp;
<br/>discrimination in your friend <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span>'s sentiments respecting <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> P.</span>. 
<br/>I am sorry I ever said anything against him. I do not avow myself a 
<br/>friend or partizan of either but I certainly feel attached to the principles of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">55</span>liberal rather than of the illiberal party This is rather a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">railled</span> story but I dare say y
<br/>will make out my meaning. The people in <span class="">England</span> have no idea of these 
<br/>matters &amp; it is very difficult to give the full idea in few words to one 
<br/>not actually on the spot?</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I find that the fresh water lake about which Mokoters told us is a pon

<br/>actually exist. The distance is 2 months in bullock waggons &amp; no French

<br/>Will you write on receipt of this &amp; again 2 or 3 months after?  We have comm<br/>-unications with the colony every 3 months &amp; a talk is amongst us of establishing 
<br/>a post to go down to <span class="">Colesburg</span> once a month &amp; bring letters, parcels &amp;c. Address

<br/>specific enough for finding my residence or you might say <span class="">Kuruman</span> as the post 
<br/>will most probably be from thence to <span class="">Colesberg</span>. I shall give you more certain 
<br/>information when I write next- At present I am ignorant myself I must 
<br/>take this to <span class="">K</span> &amp; send it back again with my people who return to <span class="">Bethelsd</span><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">or</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the Capt<span class="sup ">n</span> of our vessel was very obliging to me &amp; gave me all this information 
<br/>respecting the use of this quadrant in his power, frequently sitting up till 12 oclock 
<br/>at night for the purpose of taking lunar observations with me. He associated 
<br/>with none but myself &amp; <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Grant</span>- He soon got disgusted with all the others 
<br/>none of them behaved like gentlemen. You will understand my feelings not of the

<br/>well informed shrewd Scotchman but no Christian. He rigged out the church on Sunday's 
<br/>&amp; we had service but I being a poor preacher &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> R.</span> addressing them as Christians in 
<br/>regular cold presbyterian style no moral influence was exerted &amp; even had there been 


<br/>on Sabbath, it would have been neutralized by the week day conduct. In fact no good 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>was done, I felt quite alone. Although the Capt<span class="sup ">n</span> courted my company I could not enjoy his
<br/>as if he had been a Christian. I hope <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> &amp; M<span class="sup ">rs</span> R.</span> combined will make themselves of some 
<br/>use to the Bechuanas, they appear anxious for it.  I hope they will for both I believe ar

<br/>I have met with very few indeed since I saw you intercourse with whom would
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>tend much to promote spirituality of mind,  I feel this painfully but at the same 
<br/>time am convinced this position I now occupy is intended by Him who orders our 
<br/>footsteps to make me more &amp; more dependant on Himself &amp; independant of 
<br/>every one else.  I am reading "Baron's Mental Philosophy<span class=""/>" carefully &amp; find it 
<br/>very useful in give me more defined ideas with respect to what emotions 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>are or are not sinful.   How much need have we to watch our hearts
