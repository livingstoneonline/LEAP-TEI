<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><add place="marginleft">5</add>The subject of This essay is, <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The Divinity of The Holy Spirit, and
<lb/>his operation on The human heart.</p>
<lb/><p>The first enquiry which ought To engage the attention of
<lb/>every candid searcher after Truth, in coming To the <bibl>Bible</bibl>, ought
<lb/>To be; Is This The word of God? Let him ascertain that it is
<lb/>so, and Then every statement contained Therein ought To be
<lb/>received with perfect confidence; although it may not
<lb/>coincide with what he should have expected to find in a
<lb/>revelation of The will of God; <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>And every precept it enjoins
<lb/>ought to be received with ready obedience, although it may
<lb/>not accord with <add place="below"><seg type="metamark">^</seg></add> <add place="above">his</add> preconceived ideas of right and wrong; And Though
<lb/>he cannot understand its mysteries, or compass them within
<lb/>The limited grasp of his reasoning faculties, all ought to
<lb/>be received on the ground of The divine Testimony, and relied
<lb/>on with implicit confidence. <space extent="3" unit="chars"/>The doctrine I am To prove
<lb/>is one of the mysteries of the <bibl>Bible</bibl>, and is susceptible of no other
<lb/>proof except what is deducible from <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>that source. In <choice><sic><w>conseque-<add place="below">-ce</add></w></sic><corr>consequence</corr></choice>
<lb/>of The imperfection of our nature, and our limited capacities
<lb/>we cannot understand the <hi rend="underline">manner</hi> of The existence of The
<lb/>Trinity, abstractedly considered, but all that is necessary To
<lb/>guide our <del type="cancelled">prattice</del> practice is level To the capacity of any
<lb/>ordinary mind, and we ground our faith in those things which are
<lb/>above our reason, on The divine faithfulness.- The Terms <w>employ<add place="above">(ed</add></w>
<lb/>in scripture concerning the Holy Spirit clearly convey
<lb/>To us The ideas of personality and divinity – He is <w>descri<seg type="hyphen">-</seg> 
<lb break="no"/><seg type="hyphen">-</seg>bed</w> as being <hi rend="underline">sent</hi>, as <hi rend="underline">Teaching</hi>. “whom the Father will

<lb/>and Christ said “<hi rend="underline">He</hi> shall Testify of me”. <bibl>John XV.. 26</bibl> - As “<hi rend="underline">descending</hi>
<lb/>like a <term type="animal">dove</term>”. <bibl><choice><abbr>Matth</abbr><expan>Matthew</expan></choice> III .. 16</bibl> – As <hi rend="underline">searching</hi>, <hi rend="underline">striving</hi>, <hi rend="underline">dwelling</hi> in;
<lb/>The bodies of <choice><sic>beleivers</sic><corr>believers</corr></choice> are said To be The Temples of the Holy Spirit</p>
<lb/><p>The same attributes being ascribed and homage paid
<lb/>as To the Father and Son indicate his divinity – He is <w>denomi<seg type="hyphen">-</seg>
<lb break="no"/>-nated</w> God, “<persName>Peter</persName> said, why hath <persName>Satan</persName> filled thine heart
<lb/>To lie. To the Holy Spirit – Thou hast not lied unto men
<lb/>but God” == “Holy men of old <choice><orig>spake</orig><reg>spoke</reg></choice> as They were moved by
<lb/>The Holy Spirit,” – He <choice><orig>spake</orig><reg>spoke</reg></choice> by the mouth of <persName>David</persName>, ”and by
<lb/><persName><choice><sic>Isaias</sic><corr>Isaiah</corr></choice></persName> The <term type="occupation">prophet</term>.” Now, “all scripture is given by inspiration
<lb/>Of God” And God <choice><orig>spake</orig><reg>spoke</reg></choice> in sundry Times and <choice><sic>divers</sic><corr>diverse</corr></choice> manner
<lb/>In Times past unto. The fathers by the <term type="occupation">prophets</term>” – He is the
<lb/>instrument in the new creation, &amp; none can create but deity
<lb/>The same worship, Thus, “The grace of our Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, The
<lb/>love of god The Father and the communion of the Holy spirit
<lb/>be with you all,” “Baptizing them in the <hi rend="underline">name</hi> of The Father and
<lb/>of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” “And there are three that
<lb/>bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
<lb/>spirit &amp; these three are one,” <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>These passages prove The Holy
<lb/>spirit to be a divine person, otherwise we must admit
<lb/>the <bibl>Bible</bibl> contains <choice><sic>superflous</sic><corr>superfluous</corr></choice> matter, some of these passages
<lb/>having no meaning on any other supposition</p>
<lb/><p>The united Testimony of both scripture and experience
<lb/>prove man To be a sinful, guilty and polluted creature – “His
<lb/>heart is at enmity with God.” and all the principles arising
<lb/>Therefrom are in direct opposition to the holy feast, and
<lb/>good law of God, His affections are vitiated his <w>underst<seg type="hyphen">-</seg>

<lb/>desperate wickedness of his own heart; <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The folly and danger of living

<lb/>The perfect consistency of The plan of Mercy Through <persName>Christ</persName>, with the
<lb/>claims of Justice – <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>Its complete adaptation To all his wants
<lb/>sheds abroad The Love of <persName>Christ</persName> in his heart, a new motive to
<lb/>obedience To The Law of god. The principles which The Holy
<lb/>Spirit imparts cause him to view the world and the Things of the
<lb/>world in a Totally different Light than formerly. The change
<lb/>is so great and wonderful that it is denominated the new
<lb/>creation, the new birth &amp;c. <space extent="4" unit="chars"/>While it is the fact that the
<lb/>operation of the Holy Spirit is absolutely required in this change,
<lb/>yet man is Treated as a moral and accountable <term type="occupation">agent</term> <w>throug<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/><seg type="hyphen">-</seg>hout</w> – The Holy Spirit does not communicate any new
<lb/>faculties to the soul, the sinner is as capable of <hi rend="underline"><choice><sic>beleiving</sic><corr>believing</corr></choice></hi>,
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Loving</hi>, <hi rend="underline">rejoicing</hi>, <hi rend="underline">hating</hi> &amp;c. in a state of nature as in a
<lb/>state of grace, and though he is described as naturally unable
<lb/>To Love and serve God, yet the reason Lies in the fact that
<lb/>he <hi rend="underline">will</hi> not; His inability is moral not physical, Our Lord says
<lb/>“ye <hi rend="underline">will</hi> not come unto me That ye might have Life.” “and if
<lb/>any man <hi rend="underline">will</hi> do his will he shall know of this doctrine
<lb/>whether it be of god.” <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>And on this principle, I apprehend
<lb/>are those condemned, who choose to reject this salvation
<lb/>“this is the condemnation that light has come into the
<lb/>World, and men <hi rend="underline">loved</hi> darkness rather than light because
<lb/>their deeds were evil, some object to this view of the subject
<lb/>because they find such declarations in the scriptures as
      
	<pb facs="liv_000079_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/><seg type="catch">as</seg> these “No man <hi rend="underline">can</hi> come unto me except the father who
<lb/>hath sent me draw him”, “Without me ye <hi rend="underline">can do</hi> nothing”.
<lb/>These expressions may be explained by a similar one relating
<lb/>To a different thing; <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>It is said, the <choice><sic>bretheren</sic><corr>brethren</corr></choice> of <persName>Joseph</persName> <hi rend="underline">could</hi>
<lb/>not speak peacably to him, Now every one knows there
<lb/>was no physical impossibility existing here they were quite
<lb/>capable of it had they been so inclined. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The <bibl>gospel</bibl> is
<lb/>likewise addressed to the will, “Whosoever will let him
<lb/>come and take of the <term type="foodstuff">water</term> of life freely.” There is no <w>imped<seg type="hyphen">-</seg>
<lb break="no"/><seg type="hyphen">-</seg>iment</w> in the way of any sinner obtaining salvation except
<lb/>his own moral depravity; <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>the Holy Spirit is promised
<lb/>to all who ask it, “If ye then being evil know how
<lb/>To give good gifts unto your children, how much
<lb/>more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them
<lb/>that ask him <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>Hence the error of those who think, because
<lb/>His influence is essential to the right reception of the Truth into the
<lb/>heart, they are justified in continuing in sin, waiting for an
<lb/>effect to be produced within them on the grounds of which
<lb/>they imagine <add place="below"><seg type="metamark">^</seg></add> <add place="above">they</add> shall be Justified before god, and thus they continue
<lb/>To reject <persName>Christ</persName> and resist his Spirit. <space extent="7" unit="chars"/>The Spirit is
<lb/>the grand <term type="occupation">agent</term> in the sinner’s sanctification, though by faith
<lb/>in <persName>Christ</persName> he is Justified in the sight of god, yet the seeds
<lb/>of depravity still remain, the power of sin is broken, but its pollution
<lb/>still exists, The <choice><sic>beleiver</sic><corr>believer</corr></choice> is commanded <add place="below"><seg type="metamark">^</seg></add> <add place="above">To strive</add> against sin,, “To work
<lb/>out his own salvation from its pollution, He is commanded
<lb/>as if he could do it all himself, and at the same Time To Trust
<lb/>To the Holy Spirit as if he could do nothing, <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>for it is God
<lb/>who worketh in you both To will and To do of his good pleasure</p>
<lb/><p>Through sanctification of the spirit and <choice><sic>beleif</sic><corr>belief</corr></choice> of the Truth the
<lb/>sinner is saved from all sin and pollution and made meet
