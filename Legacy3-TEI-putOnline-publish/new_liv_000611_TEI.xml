<lb/>to my recollection the other tent. <persName>Paul</persName>
<lb/>brought it and said it was to be left with 
<lb/>us, we supposed till an opportunity of 
<lb/>returning it occurred. A short time 
<lb/>afterwards he required it again as a shelter 
<lb/>for his family till their house was 
<lb/>finished. Knowing you would have 
<lb/>no objection to this I let him have it 
<lb/>and he has used it ever since. I have 
<lb/>just been out to enquire if he could 
<lb/>not send it with <persName>Hendrick</persName>. But he 
<lb/>says he does not understand how it 
<lb/>is. Whether he is to buy it or give it 
<lb/>to me to be sent back. I think it
