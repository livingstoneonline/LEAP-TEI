<lb/>
<lb/><p>My Dear Brother</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/>Your favour of <date when="1846-07-10">10 July <choice><abbr>/46</abbr><expan>1846</expan></choice></date> lately reached this station
<lb/>Another to my better half bore it company and when we <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above" rend="gray">arrived</add> worried a few days ago
<lb/>our hearts were gladdened by perusing them. We are right glad to hear from
<lb/>you. Our pleasure however had a little alloy of pain. You mention
<lb/>the failure of your health. And this although we know that you are
<lb/>in better keeping than that of your best earthly friends. We had fondly
<lb/>hoped that you should be allowed to devote your life to that work in
<lb/><unclear cert="low">all</unclear> which we hope to live &amp; in which we desire to die. Good <w>howev<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>er</w> is the will of the Lord - this is not our house. We look for a
<lb/>better <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">land</add> where no obstacle will ever arise in our service through infirmity
<lb/>of body. Hope you will yet recover. Divine Providence will guide
<lb/>your steps. May the Almighty God lift upon you the light of His
<lb/>countenance &amp; bless you. I have had no time for correspondence
<lb/>during the last eight months I have travelled &amp; <choice><orig>builded</orig><reg>built</reg></choice> much
<lb/>but having come out to attend a meeting of committee I
<lb/>have a little time to spare &amp; will make the most of it for my
<lb/>distant friends. Do not expect fine composition or fine
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">anything</unclear>. I am becoming more &amp; more a barbarian - can
<lb/>read but little. And yet must keep up some acquaintance
<lb/>with the medical &amp; other sciences. Could not now deliver a speech
<lb/>in English. My sentences are Sitchuanized by constantly expressing
<lb/>my ideas in that language. Have lately been obliged to speak
<lb/>Dutch of all languages the nastiest This is good only for <term type="animal">oxen</term> <!-- Anne, I removed the nationality tags as you correctly surmised we do not use for languages. HB -->
<lb/>You are aware I have left <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>. It was my station. <persName>Edwards</persName>
<lb/>got there through my influence But no sooner was he sure
<lb/>of being finally away from <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> where he had been an
<lb/><term type="occupation">assistant missionary</term> than every means were put into <w>oper<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-ation</w> to get the station to himself. He felt that he would be
<lb/>nothing beside me. This spirit dictated the <bibl>letter</bibl> which was
<lb/>published in the <orgName><choice><abbr>M.S.</abbr><expan>Missionary Sketches</expan></choice></orgName> about the <term type="animal">lion</term> affair: I was not aware <!-- Adrian, not sure what the MS is an abbr for, but tagging as orgName as I consider it's some publication name. HB --><!-- Not sure, but Chris may know so I've added the tag as a placeholder. AW -->
<lb/>of the spirit by which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> were actuated and was only
<lb/>anxious for the promotion of their honour &amp; influence among
<lb/>the <orgName>natives</orgName>. We have endured the scourge of tongues All manner
<lb/>of accusations were made against me And the poor unhappy
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">couple</unclear> believed that I <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">too</add> had scandalized them. They thought I had
<lb/>been actuated by the same spirit as themselves. They had an intense
<lb/>desire to get quit of me and actually came all the way out to
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> beseeching <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> to use all his influence with me to
<lb/>induce me to leave <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> replied Why <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> consulted us
<lb/>all as to the propriety of his going to another tribe in order that the
<lb/>gospel might have a wider range in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. "O had I known
<lb/>that<supplied>"</supplied> said <persName>Edwards</persName><!-- last two words should not be inside the quote AM (2014-5-26) --><!-- Fixed. AW --> <supplied>"</supplied>I should not have acted as I have done" <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> told
<lb/>him also to his utter amazement that no one had ever heard me
<lb/>say a word about him but of respect &amp; kindness: Poor fellow
<lb/>Led astray by his own heart &amp; desire to be great I sincerely pity
<lb/>him. <persName>Inglis</persName> took up his abode in my cause but was lately
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">driven away</unclear> by the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> &amp; <persName>Edwards</persName> was obliged to bribe
<lb/>them by a large present to allow him to remain - they were loud

                <pb facs="liv_000627_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>in their <choice><sic>denuntiations</sic><corr>denunciations</corr></choice> - "You have driven away our true friend" &amp;c. I mention this
<lb/>that you may be prepared for trials of a similar kind as those we have
<lb/>experienced - But few pass through life without feeling sorrow But
<lb/>few escape the scourge of the tongue. We ought to consecrate our whole
<lb/>being to the Divine glory - and do good whosoever does ill. Pray for us
<lb/>that we may be faithful unto death - follow the Saviour through
<lb/>good &amp; evil report.</p>
<lb/><p>We are very happy in our work at <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName>. The <term type="occupation">Chief</term> <persName>Sechele</persName> is
<lb/>a sensible man - now reads pretty well - is fond of his testament
<lb/>and has an intense desire for everything connected with civilization
<lb/>We are poor &amp; cannot help much. But when he has no soap
<lb/>he washes his clothes with pipe clay - We hope his people will
<lb/>follow his example. He &amp; his wives are our best <term type="occupation">scholars</term> &amp;
<lb/>afford us much satisfaction None however are converted
<lb/>This is the great <foreign xml:lang="la">desideratum</foreign>. Our thoughts always light on
<lb/>it. The locality we now inhabit is not good - our water
<lb/>is scanty &amp; bad but we hope to remove to a better shortly
<lb/>This will make hard work for me but it is all in the
<lb/>course of the service of a good <term type="occupation">master</term>. So we cannot grumble
<lb/>this subject brings a remark of yours to <choice><sic>to</sic><corr/></choice> my recollection
<lb/>You worked a day or two on <choice><sic><persName>John</persName>s</sic><corr><persName>John</persName>'s</corr></choice> farm &amp; got knocked up for <w>sever<supplied cert="medium">al</supplied></w>
<lb/>days after - Did you wonder at it - What a <term type="occupation">physiologist</term> you are.!
<lb/>Suppose you had worked two hours <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">each day</add> for the first week three for the
<lb/>second &amp; four for the third &amp; so on would you have been
<lb/>knocked up<supplied cert="high">?</supplied> Your system may not yet be all fitted for work
<lb/>but we cannot conclude that it never will be - you are not yet old
<lb/>When I thought of writing to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> - it was with the persuasion
<lb/>that you would be qualified both physically &amp; mentally for <term type="occupation">missionary
<lb/>labour</term> and a recommendation from any one in whom the
<lb/><orgName>Directors</orgName> had confidence would have materially facilitated your
<lb/>acceptance - In <placeName><country>China</country></placeName> there is not much <choice><orig>bodyly</orig><reg>bodily</reg></choice> or other manual
<lb/>labour &amp; so in <placeName><country>India</country></placeName> But here we have more manual exertion
<lb/>than mental<supplied cert="high">.</supplied> Commit thy way unto the Lord - Trust also in Him
<lb/>We have recently returned from a long tour through the <placeName><region>region
<lb/>lying Eastward of <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName></region></placeName> We visited very many tribes who have
<lb/>never seen a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> before - the country is more populous <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>than anywhere else in the <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> land</region></placeName>. The <w>near<supplied cert="high">er</supplied></w> we approach
<lb/>the coast the population becomes the more dense - more civilized
<lb/>too for they weave <term type="plant">cotton</term> &amp; work in iron Tin, Copper &amp; brass
<lb/>The men too carry on the operations of <term type="occupation">husbandry</term>. A large river
<lb/>called the <placeName><geogName type="river">Ourie</geogName></placeName> or <placeName><geogName type="river">Limpopo</geogName></placeName> wends its way to the sea. It is <measure>more
<lb/>than 400 <choice><abbr>yds</abbr><expan>yards</expan></choice> <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice></measure>. But all the fountains have been seized<!-- geog: fountains of Limpopo -->
<lb/>by <term type="people">Dutch emigrants</term> commonly called <orgName><choice><sic>Boors</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> - and they
<lb/>treat the <orgName>natives</orgName> very badly. Many of the <orgName>natives</orgName> fled from
<lb/>our waggon when we were travelling as if they had beheld an
<lb/>enemy - Poor people they are destroyed for lack of knowledge
<lb/>they hate &amp; kill each other so the <orgName><choice><sic>Boors</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> find them an easy
<lb/>prey. The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> are admitted by all the <orgName><choice><sic>Boors</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> to be an
<lb/>honest, quiet people yet they treat them as <term type="occupation">slaves</term> - make
<lb/>them work without wages, and beat them shamefully -
<lb/>They lately attacked one tribe - killed a great number and
<lb/>took 400 <orgName>captives</orgName> - the booty amounted to 10,000 <term type="animal">sheep</term> and
<lb/><term type="animal">cattle</term> beyond number - their Redeemer is mighty But

                <pb facs="liv_000627_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>they know him not - your question respecting the complete
<lb/>annihilation of the idea of a supreme being in the <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term>
<lb/>mind is rather difficult of solution - We come after <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>
<lb/>have been in the country 30 years. <foreign xml:lang="und"><unclear cert="low">Morimo</unclear></foreign> or God or <term type="occupation">Chief</term> is <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>with every one's mouth. Intelligent <orgName>natives</orgName> say their forefathers
<lb/><unclear cert="low">spoke</unclear> of God in the same way. A man escapes from an <term type="animal">Elephant</term>
<lb/>or <term type="animal">lion</term> - He instantly exclaims <supplied cert="high">"</supplied>How good God is to me! <choice><sic>"</sic><corr></corr></choice>What a heart
<lb/>God has to me!" A person is sick or dies - the exclamation then is
<lb/>"God has no heart<supplied cert="high">"</supplied> <del type="strikethrough"><choice><abbr>viz</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice></del> <add place="above">i.e.</add> He is not kind - they have parables from
<lb/><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/> we who are better informed can gather the idea of a future
<lb/>state The knowledge of some of these parables is universal and
<lb/>if we can believe testimony it was so of old - Here is one - God
<lb/>sent a <term type="animal"><choice><orig>Cameleon</orig><reg>Chameleon</reg></choice></term> to say to men - <supplied cert="high">"</supplied>though you die you do not vanish
<lb/>(or become annihilated), you will return again" the <term type="animal"><choice><orig>Cameleon</orig><reg>Chameleon</reg></choice></term> being
<lb/>a slow walker was outstripped by the little black <term type="animal">lizard</term> sent by
<lb/>another And the latter came first to man - the Black <term type="animal">Lizard</term> <unclear cert="low">said</unclear>
<lb/>to men <supplied cert="high">"</supplied>One will come after me &amp; tell you that when you die you
<lb/>will not perish but will return again - It is all a message of lies
<lb/>When you die you perish as an <term type="animal">ox</term><supplied cert="high">"</supplied> - When the <term type="animal"><choice><orig>Cameleon</orig><reg>Chameleon</reg></choice></term> came, men
<lb/>stopped his mouth by saying <supplied>"</supplied>O we know your message it is all
<lb/>lies -" There are cairns in the hills and when a <term type="occupation">traveller</term> comes
<lb/>to one he throws a stone or branch of a tree to it and says with a
<lb/>loud voice <supplied>"</supplied>Hail O King - Let it be well with me in the way I now
<lb/>go - Let me find game - Let it be pleasant for me among the people
<lb/>I may meet<supplied cert="high">"</supplied> - from these &amp; other facts we who are more enlightened
<lb/>can gather fragments which seem to point to a primitive faith &amp;
<lb/>worship. But none of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> in distant parts can <w>conn-
<lb break="no"/>ect</w> these fragments together so as to form one rational idea on the
<lb/>subject of the Godhead or futurity - They seem at one period to
<lb/>have worshipped animals. A little <term type="insect">beetle</term> is tied on the hair and
<lb/>something like a prayer is sometimes made to it If a <term type="tribe">Marolong</term> (one
<lb/>of the tribes) kills a <term type="animal">khoodoo</term> he breaks out into a loud wail - <supplied>"</supplied>O
<lb/>I have killed my father. What shall I do yo yo yo yo<supplied>"</supplied>. If asked why
<lb/>they do so - "It is our custom. We saw our forefathers do so &amp; we do
<lb/>the same<supplied>"</supplied>. They laugh at it - Have not the smallest devotional <w>feel<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/></w>-ing unless spitting on the ground when they see the animal after
<lb/>which their tribe is named can be denominated such an
<lb/>emotion. <space extent="1" unit="words"/>Am glad you decide not to go to <placeName><settlement type="town">Kilmarnock</settlement></placeName> It
<lb/>would be a false step - <space extent="1" unit="chars"/><persName>Father</persName> does not understand the matter
<lb/>I have examined the "new views" as they are called and find as you do
<lb/>many excellent things in connection with them But still in relation
<lb/>to the fundamental points I believe they are quite erroneous. I came to
<lb/>that conclusion without any regard to "Authority" of names or systems
<lb/>They are favoured with success in <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName> just because the
<lb/>majority of the <term type="people">Scotch</term> preaching has been outrageously wrong in
<lb/>the opposite direction - I question whether success would attend
<lb/>them where the "mercantile views" the "waiting systems" have not been
<lb/>prominent in the preaching of <term type="occupation">ministers</term>. Study thoroughly my
<lb/>Dear brother If you become a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> you will have little
<lb/>time then. I wish I had a thorough education. If your constitution
<lb/>is not ruined you would be better in connection with <orgName>our
<lb/>Society</orgName> than <term type="occupation">school keeping</term> because you would have both
<lb/>summer and winter for study. If you can afford it Go to
<lb/>some eminent <term type="occupation">physician</term> &amp; request his opinion on your health,

                <pb facs="liv_000627_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>also whether you may think of <term type="occupation">Missionary labour</term>. <orgName>Our Society</orgName> has been trying
<lb/>to get <term type="occupation">agents</term> for <placeName><country>China</country></placeName> &amp; after trial of several have come to the resolution of
<lb/>educating sixteen expressly for that <orgName>Mission</orgName>. The funds are at present
<lb/>depressed but will come round again. However you will know
<lb/>best how to act. Let us hear from you soon &amp; often. We answer all
<lb/>who write us but find it beyond our <choice><sic>tempers</sic><corr>tempers'</corr></choice> utmost stretch to
<lb/>write those who maintain majestic silence. I thank you most
<lb/>heartily for the <bibl>books</bibl> you sent. Am sorry I cannot possibly send you
<lb/>any money. The reason - a most cogent one - is, I have none - We got <!-- Ha! I love DL's login on that one :) HB -->
<lb/><bibl>letter after letter from home</bibl> breathing the most ardent aspirations
<lb/>for emigration - We made a great effort &amp; sent £20 to enable them to
<lb/>emigrate. Think of the acknowledgement It runs as follows - "<persName>John</persName>'s
