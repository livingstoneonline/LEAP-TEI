<br/><p class="p ">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p ">That I might be able in my first communication
<br/>to inform the Directors respecting my prospects of usefulness
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in the cause of <span class="">Christ</span> amongst the Heathen I have delayed
<br/>announcing my arrival at <span class="">Kuruman</span> for a period of nearly
<br/>two months. <span class="space" title="space: 3 chars ">      </span>We came hither on the <span class="">31<span class="sup ">st</span> July</span> and
<br/>received a most cordial welcome from the bretheren
<br/><span class="">Hamilton</span> and <span class="">Edwards</span>, the warmth of it awakened
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>in my bosom feelings of fraternal affection to both
<br/>and these subsequent intercourse has tended
<br/>much to increase</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As it is in accordance with my own long cherished 
<br/>desire and the intentions of the Directors that my
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>chief energies should be directed to the evangelization
<br/>of the tribes in the <span class="">Interior</span> the mode in which
<br/>this can best be effected has become a topic
<br/>of intense interest in many conversations, we have 
<br/>had together. <span class="space" title="space: 3 chars ">      </span>The decision of the Directors, from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: judgments">judgements</span> matured by long experience is that an
<br/>extensive native agency is the most efficient mode
<br/>of spreading the gospel.  In this decision most
<br/>of the missionaries I have seen fully concur,
<br/>The question therefore where are these to be got for
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the extensive field beyond us has become to me
<br/>one of peculiar interest,  Whilst in <span class="">England</span>
<br/>I had formed the opinion that great things
<br/>might be done by means of this mission, -
<br/>that it might be formed into a sort of
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>focus from which might diverge in every
<br/>direction the beams of Divine truth but after

	

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>having personally inspected most of the surrounding localities
<br/>in connexion with this station I am compelled partially
<br/>to relinquish the hope in so far as very extended operation
<br/>are concerned, the great desideratum is a want of
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>population,  There is no want of success considering the
<br/>smallness of the number who usually attend the preaching of
<br/>the word, nor can we consider even the attendance small
<br/>when we remember the paucity of people actually within
<br/>a reasonable distance of the church.  What in <span class="">England</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>we should call a fair proportion pay respect to the gospel
<br/>by their presence and a larger proportion still give
<br/>gratifying evidence of <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: attachment">attatchment</span> to its principles by their
<br/>walk and conversation. But the population being
<br/>small even although there is a large proportion of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>believers there must be a small number qualified
<br/>if with nothing more with only the willing mind to endu
<br/>hardship for the benefit of their fellow men. I should
<br/>not have called your attention to this which appears
<br/>the only unfavourable feature in the mission had there
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>been any probability of an increase of population
<br/>The cause of the steady decrease instead of augmentation
<br/>of inhabitants has been in operation for a great numbe
<br/>of years, the <span class="">Interior</span> is quiet, as the gospel extends its
<br/>influence peace will become more permanent and unless
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the Bechuanas entirely relinquish their present mode of
<br/>life, - hold something else in estimation as their chief
<br/>riches than cattle We cannot expect that <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>will ever become populous.  Regard for the welfare
<br/>of their cattle will always lead them to choose more 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>healthy locations for them than what this district presents</p>
<br/><p class="p ">That the Directors may judge whether my fears are well
<br/>grounded I may mention that within a circle of 8 or 10 miles
<br/>around the station there are not a thousand inhabitants. 
<br/>The total number of native houses, (occupied &amp; unoccupied)
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>on this station is 185, ⅕ at least should be deducted
<br/>for the unoccupied or used only as sort of storerooms
<br/>and sleeping apartments for the unmarried females

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>But if we take this number and take as an average the highest
<br/>from frequent personal inspection I should say we can possibly
<br/>give, avg. 5 We have only 925 as the total number of men
<br/>women and children.  The above average exceeds by 2 that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>usually taken by the French missionaries in estimating the popu
<br/>-lation around them. <span class="space" title="space: 3 chars ">      </span>There is however a much
<br/>larger population about 16 miles off. Probably there are
<br/>in that location 1500 souls, Amongst whom also the gospel
<br/>has met with considerable success,  In another direction
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>about 30 or 35 miles distant there are two villages each
<br/>containing from 150 to 200 inhabitants</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Although the population is small in this district there is
<br/>no want of inhabitants farther to the North and North-
<br/>East. At <span class="">Taons</span> (pronounced Towns) which lies about
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>East by North of this <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Owen</span> of the Church Missionary
<br/>Society estimated the population at 15 or 20,000, the bretheren
<br/>itinerate thither although it is nearly 100 miles distant
<br/>and though but little positive success has attended their
<br/>endeavours the prospect is cheering, the truth is working
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>its way and will soon prevail, even the violent <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 5 chars, cause: damage">[     ]</span><br/>-ition manifested in encouraging for anything is better <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: damage">[    ]</span>
<br/>stupid indifference</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In view of the limited choice we are reduced to at this
<br/>station I may be allowed to suggest that we make the most
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of whatever agents we can find, Although desirable that
<br/>they have somewhat more than decided piety it is I
<br/>conceive not absolutely necessary,  Evils may arise from
<br/>their ignorance and mistakes but good will certainly be
<br/>done and I should hope it will abide while the effects
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of their deficiencies will vanish before more efficient
<br/>agents whom they themselves may now be instrumental 
<br/>in partially preparing,  Making the most of every man
<br/>under them seems to have been the reason, by the blessing 
<br/>of God, of the great success of the bretheren at <span class="">Griqua Town</span></p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><p class="p ">I purpose accompanying Br.<span class="">Edwards</span> in his journey
<br/>to the <span class="">Interior</span> as I am informed by the bretheren who are
<br/>best able to judge it will be advantageous for me in many
<br/>respects. I shall become better acquainted with the habits
<br/>of the people, their language and by exclusion from

	

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>from all European society for some time I hope to slip more
<br/>readily into their mode of thinking which is essentially different
<br/>from ours. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> seems intimately acquainted with
<br/>native character and there is little fear but we shall be kindly
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>received more especially by those who have again &amp; again sent
<br/>messages for missionaries, There is reason to believe that the
<br/><span class="add  inline">˄</span> <span class="add  above">names</span> of <span class="">Hamilton</span>, <span class="">Edwards</span> &amp; <span class="">Moffat</span> are well known hundreds of
<br/>miles beyond us as the nomadic habits of the people very much
<br/>favours the transmission of news - We take with <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">us</span> two of
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the best qualified of our members here for the purpose of planting
<br/>them as native teachers in some promising locality, the expenses
<br/>of one of whom (if I do not receive in time the concurrence of
<br/><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Phillip</span>), I shall endeavour to defray myself. the work is
<br/>urgent. souls are perishing: and what more efficient
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>introduction can there be, for the new missionaries which
<br/>I hope will soon follow us, than the residence for some
<br/>months previously of one or two native teachers</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am exceedingly gratified to observe the confidence which 
<br/>has been inspired into the minds of the Bechuanas of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>efficacy of our medicines . by a very successful care of treatment 
<br/>which happened a day or two after our arrival. The bretheren
<br/>say it is altogether unprecedented and an <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: unsuccessfull">unsuccesfull</span> case
	<br/>
<br/>since has not in least abated their confidence. I feel thankfull
<br/>and hope it will by the blessing of God, enable <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">me</span> to win
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>their attention to a much more important topic than
<br/>the preservation of their bodies, even the salvation of
<br/>their immortal souls.</p>
