<lb/><p rend="right">22 March 1858</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Sir</persName></p>
<lb/><p>One or two things having come 
<lb/>to my recollection as probably worthy 
<lb/>of insertion in the abridgement I 
<lb/>note them down in order to send them 
<lb/>back from <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> which 
<lb/>place we hope to reach in the course 
<lb/>of four or five days, and I may 
<lb/>just say to you that we have had very 
<lb/>fine weather up to this time and all 
<lb/>my companions seem to be men in of 
<lb/>the right stamp. I look upon this 
<lb/>as a smile on our enterprise from 
<lb/>the <unclear cert="medium">Benignant</unclear> Father in Heaven. 
<lb/>May He <hi rend="underline">graciously </hi> continue to prosper us.</p>
<lb/><p>When speaking of the quantities of 
<lb/>honey in the country above <placeName>Tete</placeName>, it 
<lb/>may be well to remark that. We have 
<lb/>several varieties of bees in the country, 
<lb/>and some of them are without stings. 
<lb/>One called Motla<!--MH accent--> makes its hive 
<lb/>always in the ground but a <del type="strikethrough">still</del> very 
<lb/>small variety of the same selects trees 
<lb/>for this purpose. The honey is 
<lb/>decidedly aromatic and sensibly 
<lb/>acidulated in taste. The latter species 
<lb/>swarm around any person who 
<lb/>comes near their hive and lights on 
<lb/>the face and hands and apparently 
<lb/>sucks the perspiration. It resembles

<lb/>and is not much larger than the small 
<lb/>common black ant and if it exists 
<lb/>in Palestine may be the "ant" 
<lb/>of Solomon, for I am not aware 
<lb/>that the habit of "providing her 
<lb/>meat in summer, and gathering 
<lb/>her food in harvest" can be ascribed 
<lb/>to any ant as well as it can be 
<lb/>to this species of bee. It would be 
<lb/>worth while for those who travel 
<lb/>in Palestine to examine this point.</p><!--line between paragraphs-->
<lb/><p>At the point given of the pounding 
<lb/>of corn in mortars by the 
<lb/>ancient Egyptians - the following 
<lb/>illustration of a scriptural phrase 
<lb/>might be put in-</p>
<lb/><p><term type="reference">"though thou bray a fool in 
<lb/>a mortar among wheat with a 
<lb/>pestle yet will his foolishness not 
<lb/>depart from him."</term> When wheat 
<lb/>or other grain is pounded in the 
<lb/>mortars here represented a little 
<lb/>water is added and very soon 
<lb/>the bran is stripped off the seed 
<lb/>the idea present to the mind of 
<lb/>any one who has witnessed the 
<lb/>operation is this, if wheat is 
<lb/>brayed the outer scale is stripped off

<lb/>but though a fool were subjected 
<lb/>to the same treatment his folly 
<lb/>would still cleave to him.</p><!--line between paragraphe-->
<lb/><p>When <persName>Professor Owen</persName>
<lb/>spoke at the Farewell dinner 
<lb/>given by the Royal Geographical 
<lb/>Society he remarked that 
<lb/>though I had let their ideas 
<lb/>of the majesty of the South 
<lb/>African Lion down consid-
<lb break="no"/>-erably, he could assure 
<lb/>his hearers that the British 
<lb/>Lion which once inhabited 
<lb/>these islands was a very 
<lb/>different animal from 
<lb/>that with which I was 
<lb/>acquainted and its size 
<lb/>indicated that it was 
<lb/>really a noble majestic 
<lb/>beast. The speech is 
<lb/>to be published in the <term type="reference">transactions 
<lb/>of the Geographical Society</term>
<lb/>and if not too much trouble 
<lb/>might make a good 
<lb/>footnote</p>

<lb/><p>I give these for your consideration 
<lb/>if you think them unworthy 
<lb/>of insertion just drop them 
<lb/>without ever taking the 
<lb/>trouble to tell me you have 
<lb/>done so. As I am writing 
<lb/>about <term type="reference">the book</term> I may just 
<lb/>mention that if you think 
<lb/>more illustrations desirable 
<lb/>there are several scenes 
<lb/>in possession of <persName>Mr Oswell</persName>
<lb/>and they are at our disposal 
<lb/>at any time. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Murray</persName>
<lb/>knows them - they are at 
<lb/>Burlington Hotel Cork <choice><abbr>St.</abbr><expan>Street</expan></choice></p>
<lb/><p>A week after we 
<lb/>left Liverpool we were in 
<lb/>fine warm weather and 
<lb/>now 12 days after our depart-
<lb break="no"/>-ure it is like midsummer 
<lb/>with you. We look back &amp; 
<lb/>pity the poor natives of what 
<lb/>the Romans called "out of the 
<lb/>world" and hope that Great 
<lb/>Eastern may become so 
<lb/>plentiful yet that annual 
<lb/><!--written down margin of page 4-->migrations to warmer skies will be possible for 
<lb/>all the weak chested. I have nothing to write about 
<lb/>yet so say good bye</p>
