<lb/><salute>My Dear Sister in Christ</salute>
</opener>
              
<lb rend="center"/><p>Your kind &amp; excellent <bibl>letter</bibl> I found a few
<lb/>days ago on my return from another visit to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>, and I
<lb/>assure you the perusal of it had gladdened my heart, <w>indee<supplied cert="high">d</supplied></w>
<lb/>it is so "white" I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know how to thank you enough
<lb/>for your kindness. You request that I write you a long <w>o<supplied cert="medium">ne</supplied></w>
<lb/>in return. How can I avoid it? If I only told you all
<lb/>my heart would say by way of acknowledgement this sheet
<lb/>would be too little. I really do thank you from the bottom
<lb/>of my heart and I bless Him who has put it into you
<lb/>to feel so much for the degraded &amp; perishing &amp; <unclear cert="low">which</unclear>
<lb/>to the other friends who have contributed I beg you will
<lb/>tender my warmest thanks. This I believe you will do
<lb/>cheerfully<!-- pencil line separating from next word - AM --> But what will you say if, assuming much
<lb/>more than your <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">measure of</add> "old acquaintanceship freedom", I request
<lb/>you to begin &amp; beg from them again. You must canvass
<lb/>them all over again. They have furnished one item
<lb/>The more valuable contribution you have yet to secure
<lb/>I want you to make them feel that the <term type="occupation">teacher</term> I have
<lb/>now secured for them is <hi rend="underline">their <term type="occupation">agent</term></hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">not mine</hi>. They
<lb/>must feel a personal interest in him as their <term type="occupation">missionary</term>
<lb/>to the heathen. They kindly resolve to help to support him
<lb/>O how I shall rejoice if they assure me they are determined
<lb/><hi rend="underline">to bear him on their hearts</hi>. I think if their prayers
<lb/>were concentrated on their <hi rend="underline">own <term type="occupation">agent</term></hi> He would be much
<lb/>more successful. I believe our prayers are often unanswered
<lb/>on account of a want of "specification" We deal too
<lb/>much in <w>general<unclear cert="high">isations</unclear></w> our petitions want that focusing
<lb/>which they have when we have a specific object in
<lb/>view. Do we not feel more earnest when we have
<lb/>one only suit to urge "one thing" to desire of the Lord - than
<lb/>when we have many? I think we do, &amp; therefore I
<lb/>am anxious that the dear friends should feel something
<lb/>like being personally connected with him. If you &amp;
<lb/>they take the same view of the subject you must
<lb/>use me as your <term type="occupation">servant</term>, I shall gladly instruct &amp;
<lb/>guide him &amp; do anything else you wish. If you
<lb/>take a different view from mine &amp; think I am wrong
<lb/>you must tell me. If you wish to make any suggestions</p>

<cb/><ab>
<lb/>I shall write <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> McRobert</persName> and give him some account of the state of the country &amp; our prospects of any extension of the gospel therein <!-- geog: Africa -->
<lb/>I shall write again in the course of a few months<space extent="1" unit="words"/>In the meantime believe me affectionately yours in the bonds of the gospel <persName>David <w>Livingst<supplied cert="high"><app><rdg>one</rdg><rdg>on</rdg></app></supplied></w></persName></ab> 

	<pb facs="liv_000530_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">respecting him, by all means, out with them, you must not
<lb/>think I am so dreadfully learned or wise as to be beyond listening
<lb/>to suggestions in these matters. Write with the greatest freedom
<lb/>Ask whatever questions you choose for I assure you we who
<lb/>are situated in this outlandish quarter, never feel "touchy" with <!-- Adrian, not sure what geog: outlandish quarter should be...still Africa, or more specific region? HB --><!-- Either that or southern Africa. AW -->
<lb/>people who speak out their minds. What some people
<lb/>at home call "clerical dignity" we never think of, indeed I
<lb/>believe if it were suspected here we should call it "nonsense"</p>
<lb/><p>I shall take an early opportunity to give you a full
<lb/>account of your <term type="occupation">representative</term>. He is a <term type="occupation">deacon</term> in the
<lb/>church here &amp; one of the most sensible consistent converts
<lb/>belonging to the <orgName>Mission</orgName>, the elder <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> who are
<lb/>best able to judge say <choice><sic>He</sic><corr>he</corr></choice> &amp; his sister have more principle
<lb/>than any other in the church, and they have been uniformly
<lb/>consistent in their walk ever since their conversion. As
<lb/>to general information <choice><sic>He</sic><corr>he</corr></choice> is at least equal to the best informed
<lb/>of his nation. He always attends the school although he is the
<lb/>father of two children But I should mislead you if I made you
<lb/>think his knowledge <del type="strikethrough">was</del> is extensive. No, the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> have
<lb/>not yet had the means of acquiring much knowledge. He
<lb/>however knows the way of life &amp; can preach to the point
<lb/>&amp; with as much affection as any <unclear cert="medium"><term type="tribe">Betchuana</term></unclear> I ever heard
<lb/>I shall give you more information respecting him as
<lb/>soon as I see how it goes with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> &amp; myself in
<lb/>our projected mission into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName></p>
<lb/><p>You may see by the <choice><orig>inclosed</orig><reg>enclosed</reg></choice> that I cheerfully comply with
<lb/>your suggestion respecting the girls in <orgName><choice><sic><persName>Miss Smith</persName>s</sic><corr><persName>Miss Smith</persName>'s</corr></choice> school</orgName>
<lb/>The impression on my mind is that they are <hi rend="underline">little</hi> girls But
<lb/>they may be great grown creatures and take offence at
<lb/>the <choice><sic>plainess</sic><corr>plainness</corr></choice> of my style. Please do read it over &amp; if it is not
<lb/>the exact thing apologize for me. I thank them for their
<lb/>kind intentions towards our mission. What would be
<lb/>most useful is I fear different from what they have wished
<lb/>to send Nails of different sizes, hinges locks &amp;c. would be
<lb/>of more value than anything else. We intend to commence
<lb/><subst><del type="cancelled"><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/></del> <add place="above">a new</add></subst> <!-- I cannot decipher the words deleted here - AM --><!-- I added in the gap tag to account for that. HB --> station very near to the place where <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName>
<lb/>faced about to go home &amp; <del type="strikethrough">also</del> not far also from the
<lb/>site of the <placeName><settlement type="town">town of the notorious <persName>Mosilikatze</persName></settlement></placeName>, and as we
<lb/>must commence first by building houses, the above named
<lb/>articles would be particularly serviceable, knives, scissors, beads

                <pb facs="liv_000530_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>buttons, <choice><sic>hankerchiefs</sic><corr>handkerchiefs</corr></choice>, medicines are also valuable But specimens of needlework
<lb/>although that which I suppose they are most anxious to send I must say are the
<lb/>least useful to the <orgName>mission</orgName>. I should regret if friends should send me articles
<lb/>of clothing to be distributed gratuitously. It does the <orgName>natives</orgName> harm when they
<lb/><choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> such things without feeling they have earned them. If strong
<lb/>articles of that <subst><del type="strikethrough">description</del> <add place="above">nature</add></subst> were sent with the power of giving them as wages
<lb/>for labour, or rewards, I should be thankful &amp; it is probable they would help
<lb/>to elevate the people But indiscriminate distribution <del type="strikethrough">distribution</del> although
<lb/>only among church members creates endless heartburnings, the rich
<lb/>are offended if they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> get as much if not more than the poor
<lb/>They <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> understand why a difference should be made since they are
<lb/>presents from the <orgName>Christians</orgName> in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>, they never feel in any
<lb/><add place="marginleft">way</add> grateful thus for these presents, &amp; they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> value them half so
<lb/>much as if they <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">had</add> earned them. Indeed the chief object for which
<lb/>these boxes of clothes are sent, <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice> to increase our <unclear cert="high">influence</unclear>
<lb/>among them &amp; thus lead them to the Saviour, is <unclear cert="medium">never</unclear> <w>accomp<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-lished</w>. Nay more than this, I believe from all I have witnessed they are
<lb/>positively injurious to the cause. According to the instructions
<lb/>of our kind friends we have distributed their presents chiefly among
<lb/>the members of our churches. We have tried to be as impartial
<lb/>as possible, But notwithstanding all this the majority of them believe
<lb/>we have pursued a system of favouritism &amp; this is anything
<lb/>but favourable to our success among them. Frequently have
<lb/>I heard <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> wish that they never had had anything
<lb/>to do with these cases of wearing apparel But <unclear cert="medium">somebody</unclear> <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>takes the liberty to tell the dear friends who send them, <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>say they are altogether useless, they would however be <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>useful if we had absolute power over them; <w>suppo<gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="medium">se</supplied></w>
<lb/>the power to ask for them too the expenses of carriage with <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>believe would do away with much of the evil these things <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>produce. I think I hear you say, well, who would <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>suppose the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> had used such freedom <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>presents; nobody I <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>, <choice><sic>But</sic><corr>but</corr></choice> unless <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>speak positively. Interested <term type="occupation">traders</term> &amp; others <del><unclear cert="low">after</unclear></del> <add place="above">would</add> <w>circul<gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">ate</supplied></w>
<lb/>reports among the <orgName>natives</orgName> as <add place="above">should</add> counterbalance all the <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>from another line of policy. If the little girls should wish to
<lb/>send your <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teacher</term> a present of their <choice><orig>handywork</orig><reg>handiwork</reg></choice> I think
<lb/>a gown for his wife who in size is not unlike <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Kirk</persName> would
<lb/>have a good effect on both their minds. Colour is nothing
<lb/>to them. It may have as many as the coat of <persName>Joseph</persName> &amp; each
<lb/>would be a recommendation to it, if it were only strong
<lb/>Strength is everything while colour, size &amp;c are nothing in comparison
<lb/>An<del type="strikethrough">d</del> old black coat for him if strong would be considered <w>inval<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-uable</w> &amp; sent specifically for him would not create any of
<lb/>the unpleasantness above referred to. His name is <del type="strikethrough"><persName>Mabaloe</persName></del>
<lb/><persName><w>David Moleha<del><gap agent="illegible" extent="5" unit="chars"/></del> <add place="above">ne</add></w></persName>. But he passes more frequently by his
<lb/>former name <persName><w>Mab<hi rend="underline">a</hi>lwe</w></persName> (the second a sounding like a in father)
<lb/>I shall give him some plain instructions in medicine in order to make

                <pb facs="liv_000530_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>a match for the <term type="occupation"><seg type="weather">rain</seg> making doctors</term> of this country. Everything here is attributed <!-- geog: --><!-- Adrian, is there a smaller region he's referring to here besides Africa? HB --><!-- Again, southern Africa would be OK, though not putting anything here and in the next instance would be fine as well, as this is getting quite general. AW -->
<lb/>to witchcraft indeed they believe no one would ever die if he were not bewitched
<lb/>and then the treatment of their <term type="occupation">doctors</term> is always to destroy the effects of
<lb/>witchcraft. A few days ago I was present at a case of this kind. The
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term> of the <term type="tribe">Batlaro</term> was <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">last year</add> dangerously ill &amp; sent a pressing message for my
<lb/>assistance I went and was successful in affording him aid. Ever since he
<lb/>has had unbounded confidence in our medicines. His father who still
<lb/>lives is one of the greatest <term type="occupation">doctors</term> in the country was much offended <!-- geog: Africa -->
<lb/>with him for his change of opinion &amp; hinted that I had done more
<lb/>than attempt the cure of the body. "He has <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">said he</add> put some medicine into your
<lb/>heart to change it so You must not send for him again." The chief
<lb/>wife of the son became sick when I was away in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. The son
<lb/>longed for my arrival but the father tried by all his art &amp; incantations
<lb/>to cure without the aid of the "foreigner" &amp; despairing of success he sent to
<lb/>another <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">doctor</term> to assist him. The two combined were busy <w>extract<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>ing</w> all manner of things from different parts of her body when I arrived
<lb/>from the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. Bits of <term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term> hide, bones, &amp;c &amp;c, were exhibited after
<lb/>they had <unclear cert="medium">sucked</unclear> some time at small incisions made on the surface &amp; of
<lb/>course all believed that these were the causes of the pain, &amp; had been put into
<lb/>her by some witch. But she got no better. My professional <choice><sic>bretheren</sic><corr>brethren</corr></choice> were
<lb/>nothing daunted but maintained that there must still be some of these things
<lb/>remaining within. As the <orgName>natives</orgName> consider me as great a witch as any of
<lb/>them I ventured to give my advice in the matter &amp; recommended the <term type="occupation">doctors</term>
<lb/>to take an emetic before they commenced sucking again lest they should have
<lb/>been <choice><sic>decieving</sic><corr>deceiving</corr></choice> themselves, the things coming out of their own bodies instead of
