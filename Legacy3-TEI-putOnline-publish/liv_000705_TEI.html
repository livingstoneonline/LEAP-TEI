<br/><p class="p ">My very Dear Friend</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I wrote you about six months ago and having been 
<br/>absent from home for more than four months lately I could not of course 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>address you again. But you have often been in my remembrance. I 
<br/>have been reminded again and again of your kindness when reading 
<br/>the Banners you kindiy sent us. And more than once I have wished 
<br/>I had had an opportunity of thanking you for them In this however 
<br/>there was a good deal of selfishness for I feared that as you had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> no thanks you might, disgusted with my ingratitude, have 
<br/>sent them somewhere else. I did not advert to them particularly in 
<br/>the letter I sent acknowledging the receipt of the parcel in which they 
<br/>were. And the reason was I did not know what a treat they contained
<br/>Now however I thank you most sincerely and beg a continuance of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>same favours. <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span> is really a fine fellow I hope he may 
<br/>long be spared to the world. I have had no letter or parcel from you 
<br/>lately. this is a disappointment for I expected one at least when 
<br/>I returned from the Lake. From the <span class="">Pynes</span> I am sorry to hear of 
<br/>your indisposotion but hope you are again restored to health. Be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>sure &amp; let me know if your illness has in any way impaired your 
<br/>bodily vigour. I love to remember you skipping out of the parlour 
<br/>or springing up to ring the bell as nimbly as ever did the little 
<br/>Frenchman <span class="">Courvoisier</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">Have only recently returned from revisiting the Lake. the reason
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>we have for bending our thoughts in that direction is the Bechuana
<br/>mission having been shut up into a kind of cul de sac. On the East 
<br/>by the Boers they have prohibited any missionary instructing the 
<br/>natives A French missionary <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Fredoux</span> of <span class="">Motito</span> lately attempted 
<br/>to follow on my trail to visit the Bamapela but was forcibly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>driven back by a party of armed boers, forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles 
<br/>that they may be saved - they truly know not what they do. By far 
<br/>the largest portion of the Bechuana people live in that direction
<br/>On the West we have a country without water &amp; hitherto deemed impassable 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>and as the desert extends round to the North East we must either have confined 
<br/>our attention entirely to a few tribes or bully the Boers. I am sincerely thankful 
<br/>that God has given us an entrance into the far North for when the Bechuanas
<br/>see that we cannot go to others they become extremely careless about the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>benefits we try to impart. It is rather a favour for them to attend to our 
<br/>instructions - not <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">a favour</span> for us to impart them without fee or reward. And O 
<br/>they are as a people slow of heart to believe - patience long continued 
<br/>patience must be <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: practised">practiced</span> here. Hope deferred has been a frequent visitor 
<br/>to me since I saw you. I cannot work away at other things if I have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>not real missionary work too. this set me away again to the Lake 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> L</span> and children &amp; <span class="">Sechele</span> accompanied me. When we got to the <span class="">Ngami</span>
<br/>we found the fever raging. A fever I suppose not very unlike that 
<br/>which cut up the Niger expedition. It seems destined by Providence 
<br/>to keep the Intertropical Africa for the black races alone. No boer could 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>live in there. It cuts off stout people first and they are generally very much 
<br/>so. A party of Englishmen went in and a young artist &amp; a Hottentot servant 
<br/>died of fever. A trader too called <span class="">Wilson</span> who resides at <span class="">Kolobeng</span> was brought 
<br/>to a stand still by all his people &amp; himself being siezed by it. He got a 
<br/>terrible squeeze from the king of terrors and lay for several days more 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>dead than alive. Our children played in the Lake as if they had 
<br/>been used to water from infancy or as ducklings do. but two 
<br/>of them had fever and were nearly cut off. God was gracious to us 
<br/>our people had it too - and I had to become driver in order to get 
<br/>away from the focus of malaria. We spent two very pleasant 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>sundays with the Botasana But the fever &amp; fly prevented our going 
<br/>on to <span class="">Sebitoane</span>. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> L</span> would have preferred waiting for me <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: blotting">[      ]</span>
<br/>at the Botasana while I went forward on ox back but I could not 
<br/>leave after the fever began. We must find a salubrious settlement 
<br/>in some of the regions beyond and I have some hopes that we will 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>find such for the <span class="">Teoge</span> which falls into the lake at the North West 
<br/>runs very rapidly and probably descends from an elevated region 
<br/>the <span class="">Ngami</span> is low as compared with <span class="">Kolobeng</span>. then we must 
<br/>have a passage to the sea on either the East or west coast You 
<br/>will understand this necessity when I tell you that here we are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>270 miles North East of <span class="">Kuruman</span> and the lake is 600 miles beyond 
<br/>this. If spared to effect this we should then probably be allowed to 
<br/>introduce the gospel into a large &amp; populous region of at least equal 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>importance to the entire Bechuana mission. I hope to go in again next 
<br/>year and will make perhaps a twelve months sojourn there Dont forget 
<br/>me in your prayers. I shall try &amp; write you again but that may be 
<br/>my last. It is well to be always prepared. May He remember us both who 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">We were favoured with a little <span class="">daughter</span> seven days after reaching 
<br/>home. We have a pair of each now. 2 boys &amp; a like number of girls. 
<br/>Behold the fruits of matrimony which you always advocated<span class="">Robert</span>
<br/>is now speaking to me with all his might and turning round my 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>face occasionally when he sees my thoughts are quite away in 
<br/><span class="">57 Aldersgate St</span>. How is <span class="">Charles</span>? I could not find time to write 
<br/>him as I intended but you must be kind enough to give him 
<br/>my kind remembrance and good wishes. And your son &amp; daughter 
<br/>in India how do they get on. they have population enough without 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>travelling far. China seems to attract a great deal of attention now
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Robert Moffat</span> lately visited his parents at <span class="">Kuruman</span> - he is a 
<br/>Gov<span class="sup ">t</span> land surveyor at between £300 &amp; 400 per annum. Seemed <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">enough</span>
<br/>to benefit Africa but the mode of life he has adopted does not seem 
<br/>well calculated for that end. What a poor set you are in England
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Cant pay your secretaries decently. And then so suspicious of the <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: damage">[      ]</span>
<br/>You dont seem to know that the Directors of our society give smaller 
<br/>salaries than those of any other society 38 Wesleyan missionaries 
<br/>cost about £3000 more per annum than an equal number 
<br/>of ours do. Then such a scurvy meeting as that at Leeds passing 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>resolutions such as 1<span class="sup ">st</span>. Directors the mission churches must be free 
<br/>independent self governed &amp;c. 2. Why do you allow free independent 
<br/>churches to do as they like in reference to Gov<span class="sup ">t</span> grants for 
<br/>education. the directors poor fellows must proclaim freedom 
<br/>&amp; coercion with the same breath. I am a voluntary but if 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>I proclaimed a certain church independent &amp; self governed I would 
<br/>never think of grumbling because that church acted out its <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independence">indep-<br/>endance</span> both in reference to Gov<span class="sup ">t</span> grants &amp; everything else. then pretending 
<br/>they were only sifting affairs after "a lapse of 50 years" though only two 
<br/>years had elapsed since there was quite enough of sifting and poking 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>What would they have? Remove our suspicions and then we shall 
<br/>contribute Wont we. Ough. they parted with a stroking of each other backs 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>and puffing about the "excellent spirit which pervaded this meeting" Bah</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Wishing you every blessing - many thanks for the Banners and a wish 
<br/>that you may send more. Believe me Ever yours</p>
