<lb/><p rend="right"><term type="boat">H. M. S. Pioneer</term>, <placeName>R Zambesi</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><space extent="2" unit="words"/>31<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> January 1862</p>
<lb/><p> Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>This morning <term type="boat">H. M. S. 
<lb/>Gorgon</term> hove in sight off East 
<lb/><placeName>Luabo</placeName> with a brig in tow having 
<lb/>the portable steamer &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> L.</persName> on 
<lb/>board. We go out to her tomorrow 
<lb/>morning. <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> came 
<lb/>in over a very rough bar on 
<lb/>account of seeing us here while 
<lb/>we had come only to wood, 
<lb/>there being but little to be had at 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone</placeName>. <persName>Rae</persName> came with him<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He has the tools you mention 
<lb/>for roadmaking which are 
<lb/>amply sufficient, and 3 casks 
<lb/>of ale for which accept my 
<lb/>best thanks<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I am very much distressed 
<lb/>to find by your letter of August 
<lb/>that you have been led to believe 
<lb/>that the naval officer selected 
<lb/>by you for the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> "returned 
<lb/>without any reason". I 
<lb/>refrained from giving you 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001721_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>anything derogatory, and left him 
<lb/>to "<hi rend="underline">give his own explanation</hi>" 
<lb/>but rubbed out the words now 
<lb/>underlined at his suggestion 
<lb/>as likely to convey the idea that 
<lb/>anything like a quarrel between 
<lb/>him &amp; me had occurred, but 
<lb/>I never anticipated that there 
<lb/>would be <hi rend="underline">no reason</hi> <choice><sic>alledged</sic><corr>alleged</corr></choice>
<lb/>to you. I expected that he would 
<lb/>put the reason in the most 
<lb/>favourable light for himself 
<lb/>and was quite willing that 
<lb/>it should be so. He claimed 
<lb/>to be set over <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> &amp; 
<lb/>had not a syllable to support 
<lb/>his claim. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> K.</persName> offered 
<lb/>assurances that no interference 
<lb/>would take place on his 
<lb/>part in the management 
<lb/>of the ship while I was alive 
<lb/>nor after my decease until 
<lb/>the pleasure of the Foreign 
<lb/>Office should be known 
<lb/>but "Oh dear no he would 
<lb/>not play second fiddle to anyone"<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001721_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> K.</persName> could not reasonably be 
<lb/>placed under <persName>May</persName> without an 
<lb/>order to that effect, so it became 
<lb/>a simple question of justice &amp; 
<lb/>fair play. As far as I was 
<lb/>concerned it was <persName>Kirk</persName> and 
<lb/>knowledge of the country - people 
<lb/>and languages - or <persName>May</persName> without 
<lb/>knowledge of either, but a 
<lb/>verbal assertion of appointment 
<lb/>to a naval position in the Expedition 
<lb/>which has no existence. He 
<lb/>could not manage a wooding 
<lb/>party of natives, so I had to do 
<lb/>all that, leaving <persName>May</persName> to sit on 
<lb/>his easy chair. His eye was 
<lb/>not accustomed to river 
<lb/>work, though he promised to 
<lb/>become expert, so I had to pilot 
<lb/>him or see the ship run 
<lb/>aground perpetually in the 
<lb/><placeName>Rovuma</placeName> - and all the claims 
<lb/>referred to a time when I 
<lb/>should have "kicked the bucket" 
<lb/>not over seemly from a 
<lb/>weak dawdling whose chances 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001721_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>of life were certainly inferior to 
<lb/>mine. I have never had a serious 
<lb/>illness since my return - Had 
<lb/>marched on foot to <placeName>Sesheke</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>never spared myself - And as this 
<lb/>was the man of whom you told 
<lb/>me in London that "should any 
<lb/>one set up his back as <persName>May</persName> 
<lb/>had done in the Niger I would 
<lb/>be justified in landing him on 
<lb/>the first island" I thought it was 
<lb/>best to keep <persName>Kirk</persName> &amp; let him go 
<lb/>his way quietly. I respectfully 
<lb/>maintain that in so doing I was 
<lb/>guilty of no disregard to your 
<lb/>feelings, and I very earnestly 
<lb/>beg a reconsideration of your 
<lb/>sentence against against me. I entreat 
<lb/>you not to throw us overboard 
<lb/>though it is a fact that civil 
<lb/>&amp; naval officers never will 
<lb/>get on well together. Continue 
<lb/>your kindness and if life is 
<lb/>granted me I shall be no 
<lb/>discredit to you. I write this in 
<lb/>a hurry feeling very sorry that 
<lb/>my conduct which I still think good 
<lb/>has been disapproved<reg>.</reg> D. Livingstone </p>
