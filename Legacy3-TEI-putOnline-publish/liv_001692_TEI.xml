<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space extent="5" unit="chars"/>Dear Sir George</p><!-- persName: Sir George Grey -->
<lb/><p><space extent="14" unit="chars"/>We returned a few days ago 
<lb/>from a three <choice><sic>months</sic><corr>months'</corr></choice> tour on the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Nyassa</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>A boat was carried past <placeName><geogName type="cataract">Murchison's cataracts</geogName></placeName> 
<lb/>a distance of about <measure>forty miles</measure> - We then 
<lb/>sailed <measure>sixty more</measure> before entering the Lake <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>which is <measure><measure>over 200 miles in length</measure> - It is 
<lb/><measure>from twenty to fifty or more miles broad</measure></measure>, 
<lb/>and very very deep - According to our 
<lb/>present experience a ship could find 
<lb/>anchorage only near the shore, but she might 
<lb/>get a rock through her bottom a good way 
<lb/>out besides - There are several rounded 
<lb/>rocky islands covered with dense forest 
<lb/>and uninhabited - Adjacent to these and 
<lb/>also opposite all the rocky headlands 
<lb/>detached rocks jut out or are covered with 
<lb/><choice><sic>with</sic><corr/></choice> only <measure>a few feet</measure> of water - The Lake <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>is surrounded by mountains or by 
<lb/>high table lands that appear as such 
<lb/>the Eastern are higher than the Western

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001692_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>A mountainous Cape which we named 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="cape">Cape Maclear</geogName></placeName> divides the <placeName><region>Southern end</region></placeName> 
<lb/>into two bays <measure>one 30 the other 18 miles 
<lb/>in length</measure> - The Lake has thus a forked <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>appearance there, and with the help of a 
<lb/>little imagination somewhat of the boot 
<lb/>shape of <placeName><country>Italy</country></placeName>. We went along the <placeName><region>Western 
<lb/>shore</region></placeName> and found it a succession of 
<lb/>bays until in the far <placeName><region>North</region></placeName> the spurs 
<lb/>of the mountains running sheer down 
<lb/>to the water scarcely afforded landing 
<lb/>places - In the <placeName><region>south</region></placeName> while rounding <placeName><geogName type="cape">Cape 
<lb/>Maclear</geogName></placeName> no bottom was felt with 
<lb/>our sounding line of <measure>35 fathoms</measure> - In 
<lb/>the <placeName><region>north</region></placeName> none was found with a <w>fishing<supplied>-</supplied> 
<lb break="no"/>line</w> of <measure>696 feet</measure> but it broke in coming 
<lb/>up and was therefore unsatisfactory
<lb/>We were there <seg type="weather">during the prevalence of the 
<lb/>Equinoctial gales</seg> and found that 
<lb/>tremendous seas like those that play off 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Quillimane</settlement></placeName> rose in fifteen or twenty 
<lb/>minutes - An <orgName>Arab</orgName> dhow lately built to 
<lb/>carry <orgName>slaves</orgName> across fled from us twice 
<lb/>to the <placeName><region>Eastern shore</region></placeName> - We could not cross 
<lb/>though at certain seasons the <orgName>natives</orgName> can

<lb/>in their canoes. We never saw so many 
<lb/>people anywhere else as on its shores and 
<lb/><orgName>slaving</orgName> is the only trade - they were upon the 
<lb/>whole very civil - We were objects of great 
<lb/>curiosity to them - no fines were levied 
<lb/>nor dues demanded - <term type="animal">Fish</term> abound &amp; 
<lb/>the people seem all <term type="occupation">fishermen</term> catching with 
<lb/>large trawling nets - creels - hooks, torches - 
<lb/>or poison - One species resembles <term type="animal">salmon</term> 
<lb/>or <term type="animal">trout</term> in shape and goes up the rivers to 
<lb/>spawn - It tastes somewhat like <term type="animal">herring</term> - 
<lb/><term type="animal">Elephants</term> and <term type="animal">hippopotami</term> very tame 
<lb/><term type="animal">Alligators</term> seldom kill men so we could 
<lb/>bathe in the delicious cool waters when 
<lb/>we liked - When we passed <measure><choice><abbr>Lat.</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice> 11Â° 40' South</measure> 
<lb/>we were in the borders of a tribe of <orgName>zulus</orgName> 
<lb/>called <term type="tribe">Mazite</term> or <term type="tribe">Mazitu</term> from the <placeName><region>South</region></placeName> 
<lb/>(originally) - they live on the highlands <placeName><region>West 
<lb/>of the North end of the Lake</region></placeName> - Very many <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>skeletons and putrid bodies of the slain 
<lb/>were seen and the land was depopulated - 
<lb/>We heard of course but one side of the 
<lb/>story and could form no opinion as 
<lb/>to the cause of this terrible slaughter - I 
<lb/>met and had a short interview with 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001692_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>seven of these <term type="tribe">Mazite</term> - they seemed as 
<lb/>much afraid of me as I ought to have 
<lb/>been of them - We saw some <term type="tribe">Mazite</term> skulls 
<lb/>on trees and remains of burned bodies so 
<lb/>they do not always come off unscathed
<lb/>We returned about as wise as we went 
<lb/>about the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> - plenty of assertions 
<lb/>but in nothing did all agree except that 
<lb/>it is a very large river -</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Col<hi rend="sup underline">l</hi> Rigby</persName> says <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">in a <bibl>letter to you</bibl></add> that most of the <orgName>slaves</orgName> 
<lb/>entered at the port of <placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName> come from 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> and a small steamer <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">on it</add> would soon 
<lb/>break the neck of the traffic - without knowing 
<lb/>his opinion till lately we have been 
<lb/>working towards this and will now be 
<lb/>employed the best part of a year carrying 
<lb/>a vessel past the cataracts</p> <!-- geog: Murchison's cataracts -->
<lb/><p>The bishop will tell you all about <!-- persName: Bishop Mackenzie --> 
<lb/>his <orgName>mission</orgName> better than I can - three 
<lb/>of his men came up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> in common 
<lb/>country canoes without knowing a word 
<lb/>of the language or a bit of the way - this
