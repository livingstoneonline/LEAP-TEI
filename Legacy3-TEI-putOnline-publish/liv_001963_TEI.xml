<lb/>the impression that I

<lb/>I have no reason to credit.
<lb/>the resolution "to have as

<lb/>been banished from the world 
<lb/>of the first twelve you remember

<lb/>to take such a different

<lb/>done and beg to assure you 
<lb/>my convictions though 
<lb/>not possessing the amount 
<lb/>of knowledge of the subject 
<lb/>that accompanies yours 
<lb/>have been arrived <add place="above">at</add> <add place="below">^</add> with 
<lb/>great care.  The statement 
<lb/>which has been made that 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> had been left 
<lb/>in the country to shift for 
<lb/>themselves being so opposite 
<lb/>to the part of their voluntarily 
<lb/>forsaking us led me to 
<lb/>think often " seriously 
<lb/>on the whole subject 
<lb/>and while still of course 
<lb/>free to retain your own 
<lb/>opinions I am sure you  
<lb/>will not feel offended by 
<lb/>my expressing mine 



	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001963_0006"><!--pb/@n='55v'--></pb>
<lb/>I am exceedingly obliged

<lb/>ours will meet us in 
<lb/>time to repay them. At

<lb/>with the meats.  <persName>Meller</persName>
<lb/>is a capital fellow but 
<lb/>enormously "funky"  
<lb/>He has no idea that a 
<lb/>Doctor ought to keep a 
<lb/>cheerful countenance &amp; 
<lb/>blythe tongue.  The croaking 
<lb/>to the men at the Pioneer 
<lb/>was a nuisance to them - 
<lb/><persName>Reid</persName>.  <persName>Wilson</persName> - the steward 
<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c were past all cure -  
<lb/>and the skulking that was 
<lb/>allowed &amp; the wine issued 
<lb/>were sad to see - I could

<lb/>and if <persName>Reid</persName> &amp; <persName>Macleod</persName>

<lb/>when "Dinner" was called 
<lb/>all was devoured - <persName>Meller</persName>
<lb/>was much too good for

<lb/><p>I fear that bolt out of the 
<lb/>country is the key to the 
<lb/>bishops vagaries - the 
<lb/>difficulties instead of 
<lb/>making his mind rise 
<lb/>with the occasion sinks 
<lb/>it.  Poor thing.  A mission 
<lb/>without difficulties 
<lb/>would to me be like a 
<lb/>man without a shadow - 
<lb/>if "junk" is to be the 
<lb/>order of the day the 
<lb/>apostolic succession 
<lb/>must have left the Church 
<lb/>&amp; gone to the conventicle 
<lb/>Think of <persName>Moffat</persName> running 
<lb/>away from a difficulty 
<lb/>a lion from a Turkey 
<lb/>cock No!  No!  and 
<lb/>I trust good <persName>bishop
<lb/>Tozer</persName> will spare us the  
<lb/><space dim="horizontal" extent="6" unit="chars"/>shame &amp; disgrace -

<lb/>of my point in freeing

<lb/>them away &amp; deliver them 
<lb/>to the first man of war 
<lb/>I shall of course report 
<lb/>the whole to him.  I must 
<lb/>have the boys too.  this 
<lb/>is as I feel now and 
<lb/>a passage you shall 
<lb/>have if you wish it - 
<lb/>but think well over the 
<lb/>matter and ask wisdom 
<lb/>from him who gives 
<lb/>liberally &amp; upbraid them  
<lb/>not - if I may venture 
<lb/>a hint <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> raise

<lb/>pitch it in quietly as stiff 

     

	<pb n="0011" facs="liv_001963_0011"><!--pb/@n='58r'--></pb>
<lb/>as you like or can - </p>
<lb/><p>I shall take an early 
<lb/>opportunity of say all you 
<lb/>wish to the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> &amp; 
<lb/>if they remain doing with 
<lb/>me do it more <space dim="horizontal" extent="2" unit="chars"/> than 
<lb/>once.  We never mince 
<lb/>matters in speaking 
<lb/>but we lose influence 
<lb/>if we change them 
<lb/>&amp; cannot prove the 
<lb/>accusation - I shall 
<lb/>if well speak to <persName>Moloka</persName>
<lb/>&amp; the others on my 
<lb/>return - they seem to 
<lb/>feel the necessity at 
<lb/>least of sticking by 
<lb/>the people of the country 
<lb/>they side with <persName>Chibisa</persName>
<lb/>but have no confidence 
<lb/>in any save yourselves 
<lb/>As far as I can gather 
<lb/>in indirect as well

<lb/>are as sorry for your

<lb/>going as any of the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term>
<lb/>of course from purely 
<lb/>selfish considerations 
<lb/>The great affliction to me is 
<lb/>a consecrated bishop 
<lb/>turning tail - More who 
<lb/>now urge him on will 
<lb/>be the first to say as was 
<lb/>done of myself &amp; the 
<lb/>fighting "It was all his 
<lb/>own fault"─ </p>
<lb/><p>It must have been as you 
<lb/>say with <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> - He 
<lb/>sends regards to you by name 
<lb/>in my letter too.  He has at 
<lb/>last discovered that the 
<lb/>ivory &amp; slave trade are <w>inter-
<lb break="no"/>-dependent</w> - the knowledge of 
<lb/>whither my efforts were 
<lb/>tending made the Portuguese 
<lb/>frantic - this point however 
<lb/>is not to be spoken of now 
<lb/>I am please the Almighty 
<lb/>not done with it yet</p>
