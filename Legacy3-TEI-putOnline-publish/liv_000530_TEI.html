<br/><span class="opener-salute">My Dear Sister in Christ</span>
</span>
              
<br/><p class="p ">Your kind &amp; excellent <span class="">letter</span> I found a few
<br/>days ago on my return from another visit to the <span class="">Interior</span>, and I
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>assure you the perusal of it had gladdened my heart, indee
<br/>it is so "white" I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know how to thank you enough
<br/>for your kindness. You request that I write you a long o
<br/>in return. How can I avoid it? If I only told you all
<br/>my heart would say by way of acknowledgement this sheet
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>would be too little. I really do thank you from the bottom
<br/>of my heart and I bless Him who has put it into you
<br/>to feel so much for the degraded &amp; perishing &amp; <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">which</span>
<br/>to the other friends who have contributed I beg you will
<br/>tender my warmest thanks. This I believe you will do
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>cheerfully But what will you say if, assuming much
<br/>more than your <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">measure of</span> "old acquaintanceship freedom", I request
<br/>you to begin &amp; beg from them again. You must canvass
<br/>them all over again. They have furnished one item
<br/>The more valuable contribution you have yet to secure
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I want you to make them feel that the teacher I have
<br/>now secured for them is <span class="underline ">their agent</span> &amp; <span class="underline ">not mine</span>. They
<br/>must feel a personal interest in him as their missionary
<br/>to the heathen. They kindly resolve to help to support him
<br/>O how I shall rejoice if they assure me they are determined
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="underline ">to bear him on their hearts</span>. I think if their prayers
<br/>were concentrated on their <span class="underline ">own agent</span> He would be much
<br/>more successful. I believe our prayers are often unanswered
<br/>on account of a want of "specification" We deal too
<br/>much in general<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">isations</span> our petitions want that focusing
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>which they have when we have a specific object in
<br/>view. Do we not feel more earnest when we have
<br/>one only suit to urge "one thing" to desire of the Lord - than
<br/>when we have many? I think we do, &amp; therefore I
<br/>am anxious that the dear friends should feel something
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>like being personally connected with him. If you &amp;
<br/>they take the same view of the subject you must
<br/>use me as your servant, I shall gladly instruct &amp;
<br/>guide him &amp; do anything else you wish. If you
<br/>take a different view from mine &amp; think I am wrong
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>you must tell me. If you wish to make any suggestions</p>

<p class="ab ">
<br/>I shall write <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> McRobert</span> and give him some account of the state of the country &amp; our prospects of any extension of the gospel therein 
<br/>I shall write again in the course of a few months<span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>In the meantime believe me affectionately yours in the bonds of the gospel <span class="">David Livingst</span></p> 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p noindent">respecting him, by all means, out with them, you must not
<br/>think I am so dreadfully learned or wise as to be beyond listening
<br/>to suggestions in these matters. Write with the greatest freedom
<br/>Ask whatever questions you choose for I assure you we who
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>are situated in this outlandish quarter, never feel "touchy" with 
<br/>people who speak out their minds. What some people
<br/>at home call "clerical dignity" we never think of, indeed I
<br/>believe if it were suspected here we should call it "nonsense"</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I shall take an early opportunity to give you a full
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>account of your representative. He is a deacon in the
<br/>church here &amp; one of the most sensible consistent converts
<br/>belonging to the <span class="">Mission</span>, the elder missionaries who are
<br/>best able to judge say <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: he">He</span> &amp; his sister have more principle
<br/>than any other in the church, and they have been uniformly
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>consistent in their walk ever since their conversion. As
<br/>to general information <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: he">He</span> is at least equal to the best informed
<br/>of his nation. He always attends the school although he is the
<br/>father of two children But I should mislead you if I made you
<br/>think his knowledge <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">was</span> is extensive. No, the Bechuanas have
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>not yet had the means of acquiring much knowledge. He
<br/>however knows the way of life &amp; can preach to the point
<br/>&amp; with as much affection as any <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Betchuana</span> I ever heard
<br/>I shall give you more information respecting him as
<br/>soon as I see how it goes with <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> &amp; myself in
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>our projected mission into the <span class="">Interior</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">You may see by the inclosed that I cheerfully comply with
<br/>your suggestion respecting the girls in <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Miss Smith's"><span class="">Miss Smith</span>s</span> school</span>
<br/>The impression on my mind is that they are <span class="underline ">little</span> girls But
<br/>they may be great grown creatures and take offence at
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: plainness">plainess</span> of my style. Please do read it over &amp; if it is not
<br/>the exact thing apologize for me. I thank them for their
<br/>kind intentions towards our mission. What would be
<br/>most useful is I fear different from what they have wished
<br/>to send Nails of different sizes, hinges locks &amp;c. would be
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of more value than anything else. We intend to commence
<br/><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: illegible">[      ]</span></span> <span class="add  above">a new</span>  station very near to the place where <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span>
<br/>faced about to go home &amp; <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">also</span> not far also from the
<br/>site of the <span class="">town of the notorious <span class="">Mosilikatze</span></span>, and as we
<br/>must commence first by building houses, the above named
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>articles would be particularly serviceable, knives, scissors, beads

                <span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>buttons, <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: handkerchiefs">hankerchiefs</span>, medicines are also valuable But specimens of needlework
<br/>although that which I suppose they are most anxious to send I must say are the
<br/>least useful to the <span class="">mission</span>. I should regret if friends should send me articles
<br/>of clothing to be distributed gratuitously. It does the <span class="">natives</span> harm when they
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span> such things without feeling they have earned them. If strong
<br/>articles of that <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">description</span> <span class="add  above">nature</span> were sent with the power of giving them as wages
<br/>for labour, or rewards, I should be thankful &amp; it is probable they would help
<br/>to elevate the people But indiscriminate distribution <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">distribution</span> although
<br/>only among church members creates endless heartburnings, the rich
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>are offended if they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> get as much if not more than the poor
<br/>They <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> understand why a difference should be made since they are
<br/>presents from the <span class="">Christians</span> in <span class="">England</span>, they never feel in any
<br/><span class="addmargin"> [way] </span> grateful thus for these presents, &amp; they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> value them half so
<br/>much as if they <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">had</span> earned them. Indeed the chief object for which
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>these boxes of clothes are sent, viz. to increase our <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">influence</span>
<br/>among them &amp; thus lead them to the Saviour, is <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">never</span> accomp
<br/>-lished. Nay more than this, I believe from all I have witnessed they are
<br/>positively injurious to the cause. According to the instructions
<br/>of our kind friends we have distributed their presents chiefly among
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the members of our churches. We have tried to be as impartial
<br/>as possible, But notwithstanding all this the majority of them believe
<br/>we have pursued a system of favouritism &amp; this is anything
<br/>but favourable to our success among them. Frequently have
<br/>I heard missionaries wish that they never had had anything
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to do with these cases of wearing apparel But <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">somebody</span> <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: hole">[      ]</span>
<br/>takes the liberty to tell the dear friends who send them, <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>say they are altogether useless, they would however be <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>useful if we had absolute power over them; suppo<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>the power to ask for them too the expenses of carriage with <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>believe would do away with much of the evil these things <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>produce. I think I hear you say, well, who would <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>suppose the missionaries had used such freedom <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>presents; nobody I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> in <span class="">England</span>, <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: but">But</span> unless <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>speak positively. Interested traders &amp; others <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, "><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">after</span></span> <span class="add  above">would</span> circul<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>reports among the <span class="">natives</span> as <span class="add  above">should</span> counterbalance all the <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: hole">[            ]</span>
<br/>from another line of policy. If the little girls should wish to
<br/>send your <span class="">native</span> teacher a present of their handywork I think
<br/>a gown for his wife who in size is not unlike <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Kirk</span> would
<br/>have a good effect on both their minds. Colour is nothing
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>to them. It may have as many as the coat of <span class="">Joseph</span> &amp; each
<br/>would be a recommendation to it, if it were only strong
<br/>Strength is everything while colour, size &amp;c are nothing in comparison
<br/>An<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">d</span> old black coat for him if strong would be considered inval
<br/>-uable &amp; sent specifically for him would not create any of
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>the unpleasantness above referred to. His name is <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; "><span class="">Mabaloe</span></span>
<br/><span class="">David Moleha<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 5 chars, cause: illegible">[     ]</span></span> <span class="add  above">ne</span></span>. But he passes more frequently by his

<br/>I shall give him some plain instructions in medicine in order to make

                <span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>a match for the <span class="weather ">rain</span> making doctors of this country. Everything here is attributed 
<br/>to witchcraft indeed they believe no one would ever die if he were not bewitched
<br/>and then the treatment of their doctors is always to destroy the effects of
<br/>witchcraft. A few days ago I was present at a case of this kind. The
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>chief of the Batlaro was <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">last year</span> dangerously ill &amp; sent a pressing message for my
<br/>assistance I went and was successful in affording him aid. Ever since he
<br/>has had unbounded confidence in our medicines. His father who still
<br/>lives is one of the greatest doctors in the country was much offended 
<br/>with him for his change of opinion &amp; hinted that I had done more
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>than attempt the cure of the body. "He has <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">said he</span> put some medicine into your
<br/>heart to change it so You must not send for him again." The chief
<br/>wife of the son became sick when I was away in the <span class="">Interior</span>. The son
<br/>longed for my arrival but the father tried by all his art &amp; incantations
<br/>to cure without the aid of the "foreigner" &amp; despairing of success he sent to
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>another <span class="">native</span> doctor to assist him. The two combined were busy extract
<br/>ing all manner of things from different parts of her body when I arrived
<br/>from the <span class="">Interior</span>. Bits of Rhinoceros hide, bones, &amp;c &amp;c, were exhibited after
<br/>they had <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">sucked</span> some time at small incisions made on the surface &amp; of
<br/>course all believed that these were the causes of the pain, &amp; had been put into
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>her by some witch. But she got no better. My professional <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: brethren">bretheren</span> were
<br/>nothing daunted but maintained that there must still be some of these things
<br/>remaining within. As the <span class="">natives</span> consider me as great a witch as any of
<br/>them I ventured to give my advice in the matter &amp; recommended the doctors
<br/>to take an emetic before they commenced sucking again lest they should have
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>been <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: deceiving">decieving</span> themselves, the things coming out of their own bodies instead of
<br/>out of that of the patient. They did not wish this, nor yet that of my exam
<br/>ining their mouths But one of them stole away <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: unperceived">unpercieved</span> by me &amp; his
<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">servant</span> <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">bled her</span> cupped her of them artfully separating the fibrine from
<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">other red</span> particles exhibited it in triumph as a proof that he could make

<br/>
<br/>I immediately drew a little blood from the arm of a person
<br/>standing by, separated the fibrins by means of a little <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">warm</span> water &amp;
<br/>satisfied the whole party that this was really a constituent
<br/>of the blood,- nothing else. The doctor found an excuse -
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="unclear">much wiser</span> of the day to leave <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 words, cause: stain">[            ]</span> to another village, all this
