<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I have resolved to allow <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Rae</persName> to go home. This vessel is done, and should 
<lb/>another be on the way she will have her own 
<lb/>engineer. <persName>Rae</persName> will be able to do us more 
<lb/>good by going home than by stopping, 
<lb/>for if allowed to carry out my views 
<lb/>of what ought to be done in this country 
<lb/>a more trustworthy person could not 
<lb/>be found to give effect to our 
<w>arrange-<lb break="no"/>ments.</w> He returns therefore on duty &amp; 
<lb/>will come straight to you in London. 
<lb/>A conversation with him will give you 
<lb/>a clearer idea of our prospects than 
<lb/>any amount of letter writing. You 
<lb/>spoke to him at Liverpool and he has 
<lb/>regretted ever since that he did not know 
<lb/>you or he would have let you know 
<lb/>how shabbily we were being served. He 
<lb/>has collections of plants in charge for 
<lb/>Kew and two live Lepidosirens for 
<lb/><persName>Professor Owen</persName>.</p>
<lb/><p>As I mentioned before a small 
<lb/>vessel capable of being unscrewed at the 
<lb/>bottom of the cataracts and carried to the 
<lb/>smooth part above, seems necessary 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001531_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>to give us a proper footing in the slave 
<lb/>market of <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. Once there I have 
<lb/>no doubt but we should soon eradicate 
<lb/>the slave trade over a large district. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Kirk</persName><reg>,</reg><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> C. Livingstone</persName> &amp; <persName>Rae</persName> have but 
<lb/>one opinion on this point. Personally, 
<lb/>I am glad that the capabilities of the region 
<lb/>we have opened do not rest on my 
<lb/>testimony alone. And if I am rightly informed 
<lb/><persName>Burton</persName> and <persName>Speke</persName> confirm my views<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is indispensible that we be entirely 
<lb/>independent of the Portuguese. Their stations 
<lb/>are not colonies but small penal settlements<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>No women are sent out, and the moral 
<lb/>atmosphere is awful. I question if there are 
<lb/>five upright men in the country, and there 
<lb/>is not a man woman nor child in it, 
<lb/>without the venereal either hereditary or 
<lb/>acquired. Hence the necessity of one 
<lb/>steamer capable of navigating the lower 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> and the Cape while another remains 
<lb/>on the lakes. <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> inflicted no end of 
<lb/>harm on the Expedition  in rejecting the 
<lb/>Bann, but what could a landsman like me 
<lb/>do but acquiesce. It would have suited us 
<lb/>exactly but he certainly could not have 
<lb/>navigated her out.</p>
<lb/><p>We think that the proposed vessel should 
<lb/>be unscrewed into pieces of 500lbs each - that 
<lb/>she should have an engine of at least 40 horse power 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001531_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>- draw not more than 30 inches yet 
<lb/>come out herself. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> has <choice><sic>knowlege</sic><corr>knowledge</corr></choice>
<lb/>of vessels which his employers sent out 
<lb/>to Australia of that draught. He is highly 
<lb/>esteemed by the Mess<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi><persName>Tod</persName> &amp; <persName>Macgregor</persName>
<lb/>of <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> and his status is much 
<lb/>higher than what he occupies here. 
<lb/>We ought to have a condensing engine 
<lb/>with a screw, and a strong substantial 
<lb/>hull. Two scotch carts and a couple 
<lb/>of mules from the Cape would 
<lb/>enable us to place her on <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>
<lb/>in three months from her arrival. If we 
<lb/>could have half a dozen sappers and 
<lb/>miners so much the better. I have 
<lb/>submitted the proposition to <persName>Lord John 
<lb/>Russell</persName>. If he declines it, then I shall 
<lb/>get it from my own funds. My 
<lb/>children are provided for, so far as 
<lb/>education is concerned, and I do not 
<lb/>know a more noble object in 
<lb/>which to employ some of the money 
<lb/>got by the book than this. If 
<w>Govern-<lb break="no"/>ment</w> saw the thing in the light I do 
<lb/>no difficulty would be made - but 
<lb/>if not I think it clear that the plan 
<lb/>ought to be proceeded with and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName>
<lb/>is instructed to that effect. I wish

<lb/>you to examine him freely about everything<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He is cautious in his statements and 
<lb/>every word may be depended on. He will 
<lb/>make a model of the kind of vessel we 
<lb/>need and submit it to you. His superintendence 
<lb/>would ensure everything being done in a 
<lb/>workmanlike manner, but you are 
<lb/>not required to employ him unless 
<lb/>that course should commend itself to 
<lb/>your own judgement. If kept on I suppose 
<lb/>his salary would require to be equal to P &amp; O Company's<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>We lost a mail bag on the bar off 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone</placeName> and are quite in the dark about 
<lb/>what you are or have been doing - not 
<lb/>a word from you though I am sure you 
<lb/>have written. The passage in has a 
<lb/>bend in it. It lies to the left or West 
<lb/>of the island in the mouth of the harbour 
<lb/>and is quite safe for 2/3<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> of each month 
<lb/>at least. We got <persName>Captain Berkeley</persName> to put 
<lb/>up another beacon and when the two are 
<lb/>in line you have the passage or deep 
<lb/>channel. Fortunately no lives were lost 
<lb/>but if any one will go well to the West 
<lb/>of the island he cannot miss the channel 
<lb/>and will lose nothing. The mail was lost

<lb/>It came to my knowledge in Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> last, that 
<lb/><persName>Captain Gordon</persName> of H. M. S. Hermes had written 
<lb/>a letter to <persName>C<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Bedingfeld</persName> impugning my 
<lb/>veracity. I happened to be writing to <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Gordon</persName> at the time, and added the following 
<lb/>postscript which I think you ought to see.</p>
<lb/><p>P.S. 3 Nov. 1859. I was actually engaged in 
<lb/>writing the foregoing sheet when a mail arrived 
<lb/>containing your "copy of a letter to <persName>C<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Bedingfeld"</persName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>My object in writing was chiefly to shew 
<lb/>that I gratefully remembered your services 
<lb/>while with us as after our separation; 
<lb/>and as after conduct does not blot out 
<lb/>the pleasant recollection of your really 
<lb/>hearty good will to the Expedition, I still 
<lb/>venture to send it, and to say that nothing 
<lb/>would delight me more than rendering 
<lb/>some service to you or yours in return.</p>
<lb/><p>A few points seemed to have escaped 
<lb/>your memory and as they might have 
<lb/>modified your judgement in penning 
<lb/>your letter they may without offence 
<lb/>be recalled. "The practicable passage", 
<lb/>for instance, was not "discovered by the 
<lb/>Launch" but by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Skead</persName> in your own 
<lb/>cutter. Having been absent with him 
<lb/>on that service, our grounding <del type="strikethrough">with him</del>
<lb/>during the night prevented my being on the 
<lb/>spot when the Launch came round from 
<lb/>the <placeName>Luave</placeName> - but I was informed in the 
<lb/>presence of a witness by one who ought 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001531_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'--> 
<lb/>to have known, that the fault was his own 
<lb/>in mistaking the proper passage across the 
<lb/>bar, and sending <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> where in 
<lb/>defiance of signals made by <persName>Mr C. Livingstone</persName>
<lb/>on the beach he went broadside on to the 
<lb/>breakers. (this was <persName>Captain Gordon</persName> himself)</p>
<lb/><p>You assert that <persName>C<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Bedingfeld's</persName><hi rend="underline">proper 
<lb/>place</hi> was the steam Launch; you did not 
<lb/>recollect that she was not a man of war 
<lb/>and possibly did not know that the pointed 
<lb/>instructions of H. M. Government which 
<lb/>I read to him in the presence of the whole 
<lb/>Expedition; and also furnished him with 
<lb/>a copy thereof under my own hand, 
<lb/>assigned him the <hi rend="double-underline">place</hi> of sounding the 
<lb/>bar in the whalers <hi rend="double-underline">made</hi> expressly for 
<lb/>that service. Such instructions are paramount 
<lb/>and as the same authority declared that 
<lb/>no naval officer would be allowed to 
<lb/>interfere with <persName>Cap<hi rend="sup">n</hi> Duncan</persName> in his 
<w>manage-<lb break="no"/>ment</w> of the <term type="boat">Pearl</term>, your next allegation 
<lb/>is equally injudicious<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>You have omitted altogether the 
<lb/>occasion of <persName>Bedingfeld's</persName> resignation, and 
<lb/>tacked it on to a matter which had no 
<lb/>connection with it. <hi rend="underline">You</hi> may have been 
<lb/>ignorant of the restrictions under which he was placed 
<lb/>but <hi rend="underline">he</hi> was not. Had you been charged to 
<lb/>protect <persName>C.<hi rend="sup">n</hi> Duncan</persName> as I was, I believe that 
<lb/>your ideas of obedience would have led you 
<lb/>to perform your duty exactly as I did, 
<lb/>though perhaps not so quietly. 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001531_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'--> 
<lb/>(When the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> was aground <persName>Gordon</persName> watching 
<lb/>the screw observed that the water retired some 
<lb/>inches, before it was high water. He complained 
<lb/>to me that <persName>Duncan</persName> had allowed the opportunity 
<lb/>of getting her off to pass. As I had been observing 
<lb/>a steady rise at the waist I suggested that 
<lb/>her stern might have lifted. He burst into a 
<lb/>towering passion with <persName>Duncan</persName>, roared out 
<lb/>that he would stake his reputation as an officer 
<lb/>of 30 years standing &amp;c. &amp;c. The water was 
<lb/>found to be actually rising still, and she floated 
<lb/>and got off an hour after the scene. <persName>Gordon</persName>
<lb/>however handsomely apologized to <persName>Duncan</persName>
<lb/>for his rudeness<reg>.</reg>)</p>
<lb/><p>"The frivolous and ridiculous events" 
<lb/>(reasons?) to which you deign not to allude 
<lb/>are so for the same reasons that Botany 
<lb/>and geology are frivolous and ridiculous 
<lb/>to the people among whom we travel. In the 
<lb/>latter case the ignorance is excusable. Had 
<lb/>I added a word or two more the case would 
<lb/>have appeared clear, but this production 
<lb/>of yours amply justifies the caution I 
<lb/>exercised. (Note <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> was labouring 
<lb/>under irritable bladder, the most intractable 
<lb/>of all the sequelae of syphilis. In England he

<lb/><p>You have constituted yourself the fourth 
<lb/>witness to the fact of an altercation on board 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> after my pointed injunction 
<lb/>to the contrary. I made no charge without 
<lb/>evidence from credible witnesses 
<w>accompany-<lb break="no"/>ing</w> it - and am sorry to see that you 
<lb/>imagine your mere dicta and "belief" on 
<lb/>hearsay could subvert point blank 
<lb/>evidence. You cannot be a witness <del type="strikethrough">to</del>
<lb/>respecting the putridity exposed to view 
<lb/>after <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> was turned off, you 
<lb/>being I believe at the time in <placeName>Simon's Bay</placeName>. 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">You did not hear</hi><persName>Bedingfeld</persName> "<hi rend="underline">quietly</hi>" 
<lb/>"remonstrate" for by no rule of  
<lb/>interpretation can the assertion that the 
<lb/>"rivet heads are rusting off" "She will 
<lb/>never reach <placeName>Tette</placeName> if you go down to the 
<lb/>bar" &amp;c. be called quiet remonstrance. 
<lb/>I had orders from H. M. Government 
<lb/>to see the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> safely down to the Bar, 
<lb/>and had promised to obey - but it is  
<lb/>marvellous to you that I should wish 
<lb/>to get back my promise before consenting 
<lb/>to go up river instead. You ought, 
<lb/>my friend to have known all these 
<lb/>points before committing yourself. A

<lb/>Peacock's patent on the voyage out,

<lb/>with her rivet heads rusting off after 
<lb/>only one month's service, was such 
<lb/>a palpable stupid story, you could

<lb/>is what I told you, and you

<lb/><p>(Note. I would not have troubled 
<lb/>you on this subject again as I meant 
<lb/>to have allowed it to drop, but 
<lb/>we hear that <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> has been

<lb/>it well for you to know that 
<lb/><persName>Gordon</persName> allowed himself to be persuaded

<lb/>by court martial after he left us, 
<lb/>and were he examined on the points he now 
<lb/>has written upon, would appear to 
<lb/>no greater advantage than he did 
<lb/>there. I am satisfied that a 
<lb/>great deal of the disfavour in 
<lb/>which the Admiralty stands 
<lb/>is owing to the depreciation 
<lb/>of their own officers - <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>
<lb/>declared repeatedly on board the

<lb/>"that the Admiralty discouraged all

<lb/>only plaguing them long enough. 
<lb/>It was impossible for <persName>Duncan</persName>
<lb/>to respect a person talking in 
<lb/>this way, and then followed 
<lb/>the hatred in which when <persName>Gordon</persName>
<lb/>joined my situation was
