<br/><p class="p noindent">While employed in trying to open up <span class="">Africa</span> to the influences 
<br/>of civilisation and commerce, the first thing that naturally 
<br/>attracted our attention as Medical men was the fever, which 
<br/>hitherto has proved one of the great barriers to the advances 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of Christian nations into the interior of the continent. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">We have enjoyed considerable facilities for observing the 
<br/>disease during the last twelve months, not only among those 
<br/>of the expedition, but likewise among the Portuguese and 
<br/>natives; and our experience having been very different from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>that of others, we deem it desirable to lay the results before 
<br/>our Medical brethren. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our observations are far from being so full as might be 
<br/>desired, but when travelling in this country, where the grass 
<br/>towers over head and almost hides the narrow path, it is of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the utmost importance to possess correct views at the 
begin-<br/>ning. Our remarks may thus prove serviceable in preventing 
<br/>others from making a wrong commencement. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">About a month was spent by the Expedition in 
endeavour-<br/>ing to find an opening through <span class="">the Delta</span>, from the sea to the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>main river. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">This part may be described as abounding in mangrove 
<br/>swamps and damp plains covered with gigantic grasses. 
<br/>The mangrove swamps emitted a most offensive smell, and 
<br/>gave us the impression that they were most fitly named, "the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>hot-beds of fever." </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Above the <span class="">the Delta</span> the river is remarkable for the quantity of 
<br/>fine sand which it carries in its waters, and deposits 
every-<br/>where in banks which during about half the year are exposed 
<br/>to the sun; there is comparatively little mud, and in this 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>respect as well as in the greater height of its banks which 
<br/>are also of sand, it differs greatly from the rivers of the west 
<br/>coast. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The <span class="">mountains of Meramhalla</span>, 4000 feet high appears to 
<br/>the east of <span class="">Senna</span>, and a range of hills on the north bank 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>of the river stretches from that village up to <span class="">Lupata</span>, 
<br/>above which the country is hilly, and the banks of the river 
<br/>rocky. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Warned by the fate of the "Great Niger Expedition," it 
<br/>was resolved that no unnecessary delay should take place in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>the <span class="">the Delta</span> and that the prophylactic use of quinine should be 
<br/>tried. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The season chosen for entering the river was the winter 
<br/>(from May to August), the most healthy time for Europeans, 
<br/>though not the most favourable for navigation, and during 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>the stay of the Expedition among the mangroves not a 
<br/>single case of fever occured among the members, or among 
<br/>the officers and men of the <span class="italic ">Pearl</span>, and H.M.S. <span class="italic ">Hermes</span>, who 
<br/>accompanied it. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Quinine was taken regularly by all the Europeans, with a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">55</span>single exception, to the amount of two grains in sherry wine 
<br/>daily; and we were quite disposed to attribute our immunity 
<br/>to the prophylactic so much praised for its efficacy on the 
<br/><span class="">Niger</span>; although the former experience of one of us suggested 
<br/>its total inefficiency to ward off an attack. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">60</span><p class="p ">Three of our number became affected with incipient 
cin-<br/>chonism; in their case the dose was lessened. We seemed 
<br/>always to be on the verge of cinchonism, as an additional dose 
<br/>could produce deafness and ringing in the ears to an intense 
<br/>degree in the course of a few hours. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">65</span><p class="p ">The following is the number of those who escaped without 
<br/>a single case of sickness, although exposed to hard work in 
<br/>the sun, and frequently sleeping in the boats in the lower 
<br/>part of the <span class="">the Delta</span>: - 16 officers, 37 seamen, 12 Krumen, and 
<br/>2 boys from <span class="">Sierra Leone.</span></p>

<br/><span class="note  small true">[This interesting paper has been forwarded to us with the following 
<br/>note by Sir James Clark: - 
<br/><span class="smallcaps ">Sir</span>, - I receive the accompanying paper from Drs. Livingstone and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">75</span>Kirk, through the Foreign Office, a few days ago. If you agree with me

<br/>
<br/><span class="linenumber">80</span><p class="p ">Three of our number were left in charge of goods on an 
<br/>island about twenty miles above the mangrove swamps, but 
<br/>probably not beyond their influence. The soil was of 
<br/>stratified sand, with an alluvial layer on the surface, covered 
<br/>with grasses. The neighbouring country presented the same 
<br/><span class="linenumber">85</span>aspect as the island, and was similarly constituted. Previous 
<br/>to this there had been hard work and constant excitement. 
<br/>Those left on the island, although less exposed, had a 
com-<br/>paratively inactive life. They had not been many days alone 
<br/>when two of their number became sick. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">90</span><p class="p "><span class="">Mr. B</span> -- was seized with slight rigors, severe headache, 
<br/>delirium, with contracted pupils. These symptoms were 
<br/>sudden, and followed a imprudent course of exposure to the 
<br/>sun. Although removed in a few hours, they speedily 
<br/>returned after renewed exposure; but this time more severe, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">95</span>the full bounding pulse, dry tongue, and hot skin showing the 
<br/>intensity of the fever.. Vomiting, which now commenced, 
<br/>proved the most troublesome symptom, and became an obstacle 
<br/>to all treatment, as remedies were not retained beyond a few 
<br/>seconds. Although the other symptoms abated after twelve 
<br/><span class="linenumber">100</span>hours, vomiting continued, and soon the disease returned in a 
<br/>more severe form, running on to muttering delirium, with 
<br/>involuntary picking of the bedclothes. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">When on the verge of coma remedies began to be retained, 
<br/>and the action of a large dose of calomel with jalap resin
<br/><span class="linenumber">105</span>relieved the cerebral disorder, and, by reducing the irri-<br/>tability of the stomach, allowed quinine to be given. 
Con-<br/>valescence was very rapid; in a few days all trace of the 
<br/>disease had gone. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">A fortnight afterwards <span class="">Mr.B</span> -- was again seized with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">110</span>the same symptoms, vomiting again being the great obstacle, 
<br/>and, from its continuance after the others had been subdued, 
<br/>rendering the convalescence slow. Loss of memory and 
<br/>muscular weakness continued for some time after this attack. 
<br/>While <span class="">Mr.B</span> -- was sick, <span class="">Mr C.L</span> -- had fever also, but 
<br/><span class="linenumber">115</span>in a very different form, and we did not then recognise the 
<br/>two as being the same disease. In him the symptoms were 
<br/>those of a cold, such as we see in Europe, -- at first frontal 
<br/>headache, pain in the back and limbs, lassitude and 
in-<br/>difference to what went on around; this state was followed 
<br/><span class="linenumber">120</span>by one in which he lay without speaking, headache had gone, 
<br/>the pulse was small and thready; the skin at one time 
<br/>burning hot, at others coated with a clammy perspiration. In 
<br/>this case slight diarrhœa had continued from the beginning. 
<br/>Quinine was tolerated; but although the constitutional action 
<br/><span class="linenumber">125</span>was evident, yet the fever, did not abate until a mercurial 
<br/>purgative had been given. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">These were the first cases of fever among us, nor did we 
<br/>see more for some time afterwards. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">In the month of August all the goods had been conveyed 
<br/><span class="linenumber">130</span>as far as <span class="">Shupanga</span>. Two officers were left there in charge, 
<br/>while the steam-vessel proceeded to <span class="">Tette</span>, taking with her 
<br/>those who had suffered when at the island. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">At the time the Portuguese were engaged in war against a 
<br/>party of rebels, and the army being destitute of Medical 
<br/><span class="linenumber">135</span>appliances of every description, an opportunity was offered of 
<br/>observing the fever and other diseases in their worst forms 
<br/>among those exposed without proper shelter or food, and in 
<br/>subjects frequently worn out by consitutional disease. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The <span class="">commanding officer</span> was the first case we were requested 
<br/><span class="linenumber">140</span>to see: he had obstinately refused all remedies, but being 
<br/>then in a state of coma, and unable longer to refuse, an active 
<br/>purge  was given, followed by thirty-grain doses of quinine, 
<br/>which soon restored health. In him there had been no other 
<br/>symptom beyond those of severe consitutional fever running 
<br/><span class="linenumber">145</span>on rapidly to coma. This is the type most frequent in the 
<br/>lower parts of the <span class="">the Delta</span>, especially at <span class="">Quillimane</span>. In the 
<br/>vicinity of <span class="">Tette</span> it is seldom fatal. The limited experience 
<br/>we here had seems to indicate that the type once established 
<br/>has a constant tendency to recur. Should further observation 
<br/><span class="linenumber">150</span>confirm this, it would become of importance to send all 
<br/>Europeans on their arrival to higher lands; so that, should 
<br/>they be subject to fever, they might have it in its milder form 
<br/>first, and carry that with them to the more unhealthy 
<br/>localities. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">155</span><p class="p ">While the party at <span class="">Shupanga</span> enjoyed good health, 
not-<br/>withstanding the partial discontinuance of quinine, several 
<br/>cases happened on board the steam-vessel. We may mention 
<br/>that the accomodation on board was both very scanty and 
<br/>very uncomfortable. Water running into the cabin while the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">160</span>vessel was under steam, so as to keep the beds constantly wet

<br/>
<br/>beneath; fortunately the weather was dry, or the rain would 
<br/>have poured in from above also, as we subsequently 
expe-<br/>rienced.</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">Mr.R</span> --, the engineer, had taken quinine with unvarying 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>regularity, had an excellent appetite, and seemed to enjoy 
<br/>the climate; in working the engine he was obliged to see the 
<br/>fire lighted at 2 1/2 a.m., in order to have steam by 7 a.m. </p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">An officer</span> had shifted his bed through the night, so as to 
<br/>prevent <span class="">Mr. R</span> -- getting his clothes, and he proceeded to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>light the fire in his shirt; the consequence was pains all over 
<br/>the body and limbs, the bones being especially sore, the face
<br/>flushed, eyes suffused, headache, and quick pulse. The 
<br/>bowels had been regular, and the tongue clean. A pillcom-<br/>posed of resin of jalap, calomel, rhubarb, and quinine, which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>had formerly been found efficient in fever, was given, more as 
<br/>a precautionary measure, than from a belief that this was a 
<br/>case of the complaint. It seemed more a common cold than 
<br/>the African fever. As soon as the remedy had operated, the 
<br/>symptoms abated. Quinine was given, and one dose of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>ten grains produced severe cinchonism, from which, when 
<br/>he recovered, he was quite well without loss of strength. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Towards the end of the rainy season the members of the 
<br/>Expedition were divided, those who had previously suffered 
<br/>from fever remained at <span class="">Tette</span>, while we went down the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Zambezi</span> to the sea, and explored the River <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Shire">Shine</span></span>, both very 
<br/>unhealthy districts. While one of us was exposed to sun 
<br/>and rain navigating the vessel, and ashore superintending 
<br/>the wooding, the other was engaged botanising among grass 
<br/>jungles and mangrove swamps. Yet both of us escaped 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>entirely. The use of quinine had been completely abandoned, 
<br/>and we are inclined to attribute our good health to the regular 
<br/>and active exercise which both these occupations imply. In 
<br/>this respect our experience corresponds with that of the 
<br/>Portuguese residents, who assert that while actively 
em-<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>ployed they enjoy good health. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">While we explored the high lands around Lake Shirwa the 
<br/>steam-vessel was left in the River <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Shire">Shine</span></span>, under the care of 
<br/><span class="">Quartermaster Walker</span>. We were absent twenty-four days, 
<br/><span class="">Walker</span> was seized with fever the day we left: it commenced 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>suddenly, though he taken quinine regularly. On our 
<br/>return we found that he had been delirious most of the time. 
<br/>and the fever had shown no signs of abating; but the action 
<br/>of purgatives, followed by quinine, soon restored health, and 
<br/>in subsequent attacks, when at the sea-coast, among the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>mangroves, no difficulty was experienced in cutting short the 
<br/>attacks at the beginning. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our own experience in the high lands between the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Shire">Shine</span></span>
<br/>and <span class="">Lake Shirwa</span> during twenty-four days, when we were 
<br/>exposed in the early hours to the dew from the long grass, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>continuing the march without interruption throughout the 
<br/>remainder of the day over rough country under the tropical 
<br/>sun, and then sleeping in the open air, and yet enjoying 
<br/>perfect health, as did also the natives who were with us, 
<br/>shows clearly that there exists within a short distance of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">55</span>coast a healthy region well suited for the residence of Europeans. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">This region is elevated above the sea from 3000 to 4000 
<br/>feet, and shut off from the coast lands by the range of high 
<br/>mountains to the east of <span class="">Lake Shirwa</span>. It is of easy access 
<br/>by the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Shire">Shine</span></span>, which flows to the foot of the hills, and is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">60</span>navigable the whole distance. To the north, the southern 
<br/>extremity of a chain of lakes, which extend far into the 
<br/>interior of the continent, reach within thirty miles of the 
<br/>River <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Shire">Shine</span></span>. This elavated region may be looked on as the 
<br/>entrance, by means of these inland seas, to a great part of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">65</span><span class="">Central Africa</span>, cut off hitherto from communication with 
<br/>European nations by the unhealthy lands which bound the 
<br/>coasts. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The result of our experience has been to discontinue the 
<br/>daily use of quinine. It had been persevered in long after 
<br/><span class="linenumber">70</span>the conviction of the members had been against its 
prophy-<br/>lactic power. It is our conviction that we owe our escape 
<br/>from the disease far more to the good diet provided for us by 
<br/>H.M. Government than to the use of quinine. We have 
<br/>been as fully exposed to the malarious influence as any party 
<br/><span class="linenumber">75</span>is likely to be. The vessel in which we have to navigate 
<br/>is one which takes in so much water that our beds are 
con-<br/>stantly damp, and often rotten beneath, with a quantity of 
<br/>water in the bilge of the ship. Yet we have found the fever
<br/>quite amenable to treatment when taken early, and attention 
<br/><span class="linenumber">80</span>paid to any local congestions which may manifest themselves. 

<br/><br/>Let it not be thought that we undervalue quinine, to it we 
<br/>trust for the removal of the disease when given after 
purga-<br/>tives; in all forms of the fever we have found it of the 
<br/>greatest value, and three does have always proved sufficient 
<br/><span class="linenumber">85</span>to induce the constitutional action even in those who have not 
<br/>been taking it previously. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">We have found the fever assuming a formidable type only 
<br/>when permitted to go on unchecked for some time in those 
<br/>exposed to great fatigue, damp, and poor diet, or when the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">90</span>irritable state of the stomach prevented the administration of 
<br/>quinine. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">In regard to the complications most frequently seen, among 
<br/>ourselves vomiting has been the most troublesome, and 
blister-<br/>ing over the stomach has seemed the best means of stopping 
<br/><span class="linenumber">95</span>it. We have fortunately escaped without more serious 
<br/>inflammatory lesions of the internal organs; but among the 
<br/>Portuguese two cases have been observed with pneumonia; 
<br/>both proved fatal - the tartarate of antimony seemed to have 
<br/>no effect, while stimulants were equally powerless when once 
<br/><span class="linenumber">100</span>sinking had commenced. Enlargements of the spleen, when 
<br/>of recent date, have yielded quickly to the use of the sulphate 
<br/>of iron and quinine. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The ship's company, consisting of Krumen, have showed no 
<br/>greater immunity than the Europeans. The experiment of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">105</span>quinine was made with them, but its prophylactic action 
<br/>proved equally feeble as in our own case. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">In future Expeditions of a similar nature, we beg to suggest 
<br/>that the work of the contracting ship-builders be more 
<br/>scrupulously tested than it had been in our case, when the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">110</span>defects once observed completely baffled all attempts at 
<br/>remedy. </p>
