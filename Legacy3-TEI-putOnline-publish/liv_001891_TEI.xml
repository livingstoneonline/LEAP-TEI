<lb/>is the more grievous inasmuch as the

<lb/><term type="occupation">missionary</term> named <persName>Wilson</persName>, <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName>'s 
<lb/>policy produced a sense of security which
<lb/>led to the establishment of over twenty 
<lb/>missions - great numbers are educated
<lb/>and good influences are spreading inland.
<lb/>Lawful commerce has increased from

<lb/>been inaccessible to the gospel," and he earnestly
<lb/>calls upon his countrymen to take advantage
<lb/>of these efforts while the squadron <!-- unsure if this is right. MB --><!-- Looks right. AW --> is continued 
<lb/>on the coast. On this coast the same <app><rdg cert="high">expensive</rdg><rdg cert="medium">expansive</rdg></app>
