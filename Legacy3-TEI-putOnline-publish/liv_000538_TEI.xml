<lb/>I must be excused for what you may have considered a long

<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>When I left <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> the <orgName>Directors</orgName> of our <orgName>Society</orgName> expecting
<lb/>that <persName>Mr Moffat</persName> would soon follow &amp; by his knowledge of the

<lb/><orgName>mission</orgName>, instructed me to remain at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> and endeavour
<lb/>to acquire as much of the language as possible before his arrival
<lb/>I did not however find it so difficult as they imagine it to be
<lb/>and finding too that <del type="strikethrough">frequent</del> uninterrupted intercourse with the
<lb/><orgName>natives</orgName> was the best way of acquiring an almost unwritten
<lb/>language I very soon set off in order to obtain knowledge
<lb/>of the country &amp; people for myself. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I have had three long

<lb/>The great drawback to travelling in this country is the slowness
<lb/>of our locomotives. The heavy lumbering <term type="nationality">Dutch</term> waggon
<lb/>or the riding ox are the only conveyances unless we choose

<lb/>During my last journey I should probably have seen the lake
<lb/>had my people not been deterred from following me by
<lb/>a dread of <persName><choice><orig>Mosilikatze</orig><reg>Mzilikazi</reg></choice></persName>. I saw some women who had been

<lb/>I was there. It had taken them nearly <measure>two months</measure> to reach
<lb/>it &amp; had subsisted by gathering the roots of the desert as <unclear cert="low">then</unclear>
<lb/>food by day &amp; climbing a high rock for protection by night
<lb/>The sight of these poor creatures was enough for my people
<lb/>their very hearts seemed to die within them, indeed they
<lb/>buried their noses in the sand as if the <orgName>Arabian</orgName> <seg type="weather">simoon</seg>
<lb/>had been passing &amp; declared it was madness to go a step
<lb/>nearer the tyrant. I was then obliged to leave them &amp;
<lb/>go forward on <term type="animal_foodstuff">ox</term> back with only three wild <term type="tribe"><choice><orig>Bakwains</orig><reg>Bakwena</reg><reg>Kwena</reg></choice></term> as
<lb/>my guides. <choice><sic>our</sic><corr>Our</corr></choice> diet consisted of all kinds of flesh that
<lb/>came within the range of my gun &amp; all sorts of roots
<lb/>when meat was awanting. Sometimes we had plenty &amp;
<lb/>at other times we feasted on what we saw in our
<lb/>dreams. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I visited many new tribes &amp; was kindly treated

<lb/>The knowledge of the country <del type="strikethrough">too</del> which I have acquired has

<lb/>of a too energetic working of the bellows and when they take
<lb/>out the iron burned to a cinder they exclaim behold the effects
<lb/>of witchcraft. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>The evidence is so clear &amp; there before their
<lb/>eyes no one attempts to doubt it. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>They then apply a larger
<lb/>portion of their prophylactics against witchcraft, put in
<lb/>fresh ore &amp; begin the process anew. All the people employed
<lb/>in these works sleep apart from their wives during the
<lb/>period of smelting. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>Their implements are most original
<lb/>The same I suppose as were invented by old <persName>Tubal Cain</persName>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">I may mention here that all the notions of these people concerning
