In either case, the second set of metadata will be removed from the catalogue as it does not reflect the contents of this document (since it has an explicit composition date, we don't need to muck about with date ranges). Also, the place for this document was changed in the catalogue from Johanna-Johanna to Johanna -->

<lb/><p><placeName>Johanna</placeName> 30 Aug 1862</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Mother </p>
<lb/><p>We came to this 
<lb/>island a few days ago and 
<lb/>have an opportunity of sending 
<lb/>letters so I write though I have 
<lb/>not much to say. We are 
<lb/>on our way to another 
<lb/>river called the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>by which we hope to 
<lb/>find an outlet to those 
<lb/>discoveries which we 
<lb/>have with so much toil 
<lb/>effected. We wish to be 
<lb/>away from the Portuguese 
<lb/>who are inveterate slave 
<lb/>traders and turn all our 
<lb/>labours to the forwarding of 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001817_0002"/><!--pb/@n='134v'-->
<lb/>this horrid traffic. We 
<lb/>mean to explore <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>in boats - and in December 
<lb/>next return to place the 
<lb/><term type="boat">Lady Nyassa</term> on the Lake 
<lb/>of that name. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he mission 
<lb/>established by the High 
<lb/>church party may yet 
<lb/>do good but they have 
<lb/>much to learn. I wish 
<lb/>them every success but 
<lb/>it may be better to stand 
<lb/>less in contact with 
<lb/>them than I have been as 
<lb/>any blunders they make 
<lb/>are put on my shoulders<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The Portuguese would like 
<lb/>to worm them out of the 
<lb/>country by their slaves 
<lb/>while they remain in 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001817_0003"/><!--pb/@n='135r'-->
<lb/>the background. I lately 
<lb/>called on the <persName>Governor 
<lb/>of Tette</persName> to prevent a private 
<lb/>Portuguese who had armed 
<lb/>a large party of blacks 
<lb/>and waged war from 
<lb/>disturbing them &amp; he has 
<lb/>acceeded to my request. 
<lb/>We had a great deal of 
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever</term> in consequence of 
<lb/>being so long down in 
<lb/>the lowlands - and exposed 
<lb/>in a way I never 
<lb/>contemplated for dear 
<lb/><persName>Mary</persName>. The man whose 
<lb/>culpable negligence did 
<lb/>it all had <term type="ailment">fever</term> himself 
<lb/>and was <term type="ailment">jaundiced</term> but 
<lb/>was saved at death<reg>'</reg>s door<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We can cure it in general 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001817_0004"/><!--pb/@n='135v'-->
<lb/>very quickly but sometimes 
<lb/>it resists all our efforts<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have written to <persName>Oswell</persName> by 
<lb/>this occasion but fear 
<lb/>I may not be able to do 
<lb/>so to <persName>Agnes</persName> &amp; <persName>Thomas</persName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>With kindest salutations 
<lb/>to my sisters  &amp; to you 
<lb/>my dear mother and 
<lb/>to Anna Mary I am 
<lb/>ever affectionately</p>
<lb/><p>David Livingstone</p>
<lb/><p>I think it may be better 
<lb/>for <persName>Robert</persName> to come out 
<lb/>here for a while. I thought 
<lb/>education the best legacy 
<lb/>I could leave him but 
<lb/>so thought not he &amp; must 
<lb/>rank in life accordingly<reg>.</reg></p>
