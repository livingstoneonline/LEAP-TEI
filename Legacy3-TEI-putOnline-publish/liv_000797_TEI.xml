<lb/><p>My dear <persName>Colonel</persName></p>
<lb/><p>As soon as I could procure people willing to risk a journey through 
<lb/>the country lately the scene of the gallant deeds of the Boers, I left <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>, and my 
<lb/>companions being aware of certain wrathful fulminations uttered by <persName>General Peit 
<lb/>Scholtz</persName> to deter me from again visiting the little strip of country which the 
<lb/>Republicans fancy lies between <placeName>Magaliesberg</placeName> and <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, our progress was pretty 
<lb/>quick till we entered latitude 19° <add place="above" hand="#hand03">at a place that I have marked on my map as the Fever Ponds</add><reg>.</reg> Here the whole party, except a <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> lad and 
<lb/>myself, was laid prostrate by <term type="ailment">fever</term>. He managed the oxen and I the hospital 
<lb/><choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> through the goodness of God, the state of the invalids permitted us again to 
<lb/>move Northwards, I did not follow our old path but from <placeName>Kama kama</placeName>
<lb/>travelled on the magnetic meridian <add place="above">(N.N.W.)</add> in order to avoid the tsetse. This new path 
<lb/>brought us into a densely wooded country. The grass was from 8 to ten feet high, 
<lb/>the greater leafiness of the trees shewed we were in a moist climate, and we 
<lb/>were most <choice><sic>agreably</sic><corr>agreeably</corr></choice> surprised by the presence of vines growing luxuriantly and 
<lb/>yielding clusters of dark purple grapes. The seeds, as large as split peas, and 
<lb/>very astringent leave but little room for pulp though the grape itself is 
<lb/>of good size. The <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> lad now became ill,  but by the aid of two 
<lb/>Bushmen, we continued to make some progress. I was both driver and road 
<lb/>maker, having either the axe or whip in hand all day long till we came to 
<lb/>Lat 18° 4′. Here we discovered that the country adjacent to the <placeName>Chobe</placeName>
<lb/>was flooded - <choice><sic>vallies</sic><corr>valleys</corr></choice> looked like rivers, and after crossing several we came 
<lb/>to one - the <placeName><unclear cert="low">Sanshurch</unclear></placeName> - which presented a complete barrier to farther travelling 
<lb/>with waggons. It was deep. 1/2 a mile broad and contained hippopotami. 
<lb/>After searching in vain for a ford our two bushmen decamped. Being 
<lb/>very anxious to reach the Makololo I took <add place="above">one of</add>  the strongest of our invalids 
<lb/>crossed the <placeName><unclear>Sanshurch</unclear></placeName> in a small pontoon, kindly presented by Messers. 
<lb/><persName>Webb</persName> and <persName>Codrington</persName>, and went N.N.W. <add place="above" hand="#hand03">across the flooded country</add> in search of the <placeName>Chobe</placeName>. After 
<lb/>splashing through about 20 miles of an inundated plain, we came to a 
<lb/>mass of reed which towards the N.E. seemed interminable. We then turned 
<lb/><add place="above" hand="#hand03">for a short distance</add> in the direction of our former waggon stand and from a high tree were 
<lb/>gratified by a sight of the <placeName>Chobe</placeName>. But such a mass of vegetation grew 
<lb/>between the bank and the flowing river, <add place="above" hand="#hand03">that</add> our utmost efforts failed in 
<lb/>procuring a passage in <add place="inline" hand="#hand03">to it</add> - the water among the reeds either became too deep, 
<lb/>or we were unable to bend down the barrier of Papyrus &amp; reed bound together 
<lb/>by a kind of convolvulus. You will understand the nature of our struggles 
<lb/>when I mention that a horrid sort of grass about six feet high and having 
<lb/>serrated edges which cut the hands most cruelly, wore my <add place="above">strong moleskin</add> "unmentionables" 
<lb/>quite through at the knees, and my shoes (nearly new) at the toes. My handkerchief 
<lb/>protected the former, but in subsequent travelling through the dense grass of 
<lb/>the plains the feet fared badly. Though constantly wet up to the middle during 
<lb/>the day, we slept soundly by night, during the three days we spent among 
<lb/>the reeds, and <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">having</del> <add place="above" hand="#hand03">only</add> effected a passage in<add place="inline" hand="#hand03">to</add> <add place="above" hand="#hand03">the open water of the <placeName>Chobe</placeName></add> on the fourth day. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>fter 
<lb/>paddling along the river in the pontoon about 20 miles we discovered 
<lb/>a village of <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>. We were unexpected visitors and the more so 
<lb/>since they believed that no one could cross the <placeName>Chobe</placeName> <add place="above" hand="#hand03">from the south bank</add> without their 
<lb/>knowledge<reg>.</reg></p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000797_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/><p>In their figurative language they said "I had fallen on them as if from a cloud, yet 
<lb/>came riding on a hippopotamus" (pontoon)<reg>.</reg> A vague report of out approach had 
<lb/><add place="above" hand="#hand03">previously</add> reached the chief, and two parties were out in search of us but they had gone along 
<lb/>the old paths. In returning to the waggons which we did in canoes and in a straight 
<lb/>line we found the distance not more than ten miles. Our difficulties were now 
<lb/>ended, for a great number of canoes and about 140 people were soon dispatched 
<lb/>from the town. They transported our goods and waggons across the country 
<lb/>and river, and when we had <add place="above" hand="#hand03">been landed on the other side of the <placeName>Chobe</placeName>, we travelled</add><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">gone</del> Northward till within about one day from 
<lb/><placeName>Sesheké</placeName> in order to avoid the flooded lands <add place="above" hand="#hand03">adjacent to the River, we then struck upon</add><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">on the other side of the <placeName>Chobe</placeName>, we 
<lb/>reached the town by</del> the path which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> and I travelled on horseback in 
<lb/>1850 <add place="above" hand="#hand03">and turning into it proceeded South West until we came to <persName>Sekeletu's</persName> town <placeName>Linyanti</placeName></add> Our reception here was as warm as could have been expected. The chief <add place="above" hand="#hand03"><persName>Sekeletu</persName></add> not 
<lb/>yet nineteen years of age, said, he had got another father instead of <persName>Sebituane</persName>, 
<lb/>was not quite sure, however, about learning to read. "He feared it might 
<lb/>change his heart and make him content with one wife only as in the case of 
<lb/>Sechele"<reg>.</reg> It is pleasant to hear objections frankly stated, <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">and heartsickening 
<lb/>to deal with gelatinous characters who agree with everything you say. In one 
<lb/>of my first interviews with <persName>Sechele</persName>, he asked "if what you say be true, how 
<lb/>was it that your forefathers allowed all my forefathers to pass away without once 
<lb/>sending to let them know"!</del> When I proposed to <persName>Sekeletu</persName> to examine his 
<lb/>country to ascertain if there is a suitable locality for a mission, he consented 
<lb/>frankly, but he had not yet seen me enough. Then he could not allow 
<lb/>me to go alone, some evil might <choice><sic>befal</sic><corr>befall</corr></choice> me and he would be accountable<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><add place="marginleft" hand="#hand03">A</add> This and <term type="ailment">Fever</term> caused some delay - <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">but when we did set out, though our 
<lb/>company</del> consisted of 160 men, our fleet of 33 canoes proceeded rapidly 
<lb/>up the river towards the <placeName>Barotse</placeName>. I had the choice of all the canoes and 
<lb/>the best was 34 feet long and 20 inches wide. With six paddles we passed 
<lb/>through 44 miles of latitude by one day's pull of 10 1/2 hours. If we add the 
<lb/>Longitude to this, it must have been upwards of 50 miles actual distance<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The river <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">(called <add place="above">everywhere</add><placeName>Leeambye</placeName> viz the River)</del> is indeed a magnificent one. 
<lb/>It is often more than a mile broad, and adorned with numerous islands of 
<lb/>from three to five miles in length. These and the banks too are covered with 
<lb/>forest and most of those <add place="above">trees</add> on the brink of the water send down roots from their 
<lb/>branches like the Banian. The islands <del type="overwritten" hand="#hand03"><choice><sic>and</sic><corr>at</corr></choice></del><add place="over-text" hand="#hand03">at</add> a little distance seem rounded 
<lb/>masses of sylvan vegetation of various hues, reclining on the bosom 
<lb/>of the glorious stream. The beaut<del type="strikethrough">iful</del><add place="inline">y</add> <add place="above">of the</add><!--DL's additions--> scene is greatly increased by 
<lb/>the date palm and lofty palmyra towering above the rest and casting their 
<lb/>featherly foliage against a cloudless sky.<!-- CODIC: two editorial lines in hand03 indicating new para--> <add place="marginleft" hand="#hand03">D</add> The banks are rocky and undulating

<lb/>with me viewed the scene with awe. Some exclaimed "How grand the works 
<lb/>of God are"! others washed their faces in the spray as a charm, while 
<lb/>those of the Utilitarian school searched the holes in the rock for round stones 
<lb/>to grind snuff. I ought to have mentioned that</del> <add place="marginleft" hand="#hand03">I</add><del type="overwritten" hand="#hand02">t</del><add place="over-text" hand="#hand03">T</add>he main fall <add place="above" hand="#hand03">of this</add> is over a straight

<lb/>destruction <add place="above" hand="#hand03">in this place</add> of two hippopotamus hunters, who, too eager in the pursuit of a wounded 
<lb/>animal, were with their prey drawn down into the frightful gulph. And we 
<lb/>digged some yams in what was said to <add place="above">have</add> been the garden of a man who of old 
<lb/>came down the river and led out a portion of it here for irrigation - 
<lb/>superior minds must have arisen from time to time in these regions but 
<lb/>ignorant of the use of letters they have left no memorial. One never sees a 
<lb/>grave, nor a stone of remembrance set up. The very rocks are illiterate 
<lb/>they contain no fossils. <add place="marginleft" hand="#hand03">F</add> In the bed of the river they are of sandstone hardened 
<lb/>and porphoritic basalt. All the beautiful parts of the river are infested by 
<lb/>Tsetse but when we come to the Northern confines of Lat. 16° the tsetse suddenly 
<lb/>ceased. The high banks covered with trees seem to leave the river in the 
<lb/>shape of ridges of about 300 feet high. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey stretch away to the N N E &amp; 
<lb/>N.N.W. <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> they are from 20 to 30 miles apart - the intervening space 
<lb/>or valley is the Barotse country proper, and it is annually inundated not 
<lb/>by rains but by waters, one portion of which comes from the N.W. 
<lb/>and the other from the North. There are no trees in this valley except such 
<lb/>as were transplanted for the sake of shade by the chief <persName>Santuru</persName>. It is covered 
<lb/>with coarse succulent grasses, one of these is 12 feet high and as thick 
<lb/>as a man's thumb. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he villages and towns are situated on mounds 
<lb/>some of which have been formed artificially. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he site of <placeName><unclear cert="medium">Nahiele</unclear></placeName> the present 
<lb/><add place="marginleft" hand="#hand03">G</add><!--omit written hand 03 up side between F & G - presume we areignoring all this editorial stuff at moment anywway--> capital was so constructed. This was not the antient capital. The river 
<lb/>now flows over its site and all that remains of that which cost the 
<lb/>people of <persName>Santuru</persName> the labour of many years, is a few square yards<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>As the same thing has happened to another antient site the river seems 
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">weaving</unclear> Eastwards. Ten feet of rise above low water mark submerges 
<lb/>the whole valley except the foundations of the huts and two feet more 
<lb/>would sweep away the towns. This never happens though among the 
<lb/>hills below the valley the river rises 60 feet and then floods the 
<lb/>lands adjacent to <placeName>Sesheke</placeName> on both sides. The valley contains a great 
<lb/>number of villages and cattle stations - these and large herds of cattle 
<lb/>grazing on the succulent herbage, meet they eye in every direction<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>On visiting the ridges above mentioned we found them to be only the 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>mencement</w> of lands which are never inundated. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are covered with trees 
<lb/>and abound in fruitful gardens in which are cultivated sugar cane 
<lb/>sweet potato, two kinds of manioc, two kinds of yam, bananas, millet &amp;c<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Advantage is taken of the inundation too - to raise large quantities of maize 
<lb/>and Caffre corn of large grain and beautiful whiteness. These with abundance 
<lb/>of milk and plenty of fish in the river make the people always refer 
<lb/>to the <placeName>Barotse country</placeName> as the land of plenty. No part of the country 
<lb/>can be spoken of as salubrious. The <term type="ailment">Fever</term> must be braved if a 
<lb/>mission is to be established. <add place="above" hand="#hand03">it is very fatal even among natives</add> I have had eight attacks of it the 
<lb/>last very severe, but I never laid by. I tried native remedies in 
<lb/>order to discover if they possessed any valuable means of cure

<lb/>but after being stewed in vapour baths, smoked like a red herring over a fire 
<lb/>of green twigs in <del type="strikethrough">a</del> hot potsherds, and physicked secundem black artem 
<lb/>I believe that our own medicines are more efficacious and safer, I 
<lb/>have not relinquished <add place="above">the search</add> and as I make it a rule to keep on good terms 
<lb/>with my professional bretheren I am not without hope that some of 
<lb/>their means of <add place="above">re</add>establishing the excretions, and to this indeed all their efforts 
<lb/>are directed, may be well adapted for this complaint.</p>
<lb/><p>I did not think it my duty to go towards <placeName>Mosioathuny-a</placeName>, for though 
<lb/>a hilly country the proximity to <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> renders it impossible for the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term> to live there, but I resolved to know the whole Barotse country 
<lb/>before coming to the conclusion now reached, that the Ridge East of <placeName>Nariele</placeName>
<lb/>is the only part of the country that can be fixed on for a mission. I 
<lb/>therefore left <persName>Sekeletu's</persName> party at <add place="above" hand="#hand03"><placeName>Nariele</placeName></add> the Barotse capital and went Northwards<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The river presents the same appearance of low banks without trees till we 
<lb/>come to 14° 38. Lat. Here again it is forest to the water's edge and <hi rend="underline">Tsetse</hi><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I might have turned now, but the river <placeName>Londa</placeName> or <placeName>Leeba</placeName> comes from 
<lb/>the capital of a large state of the former name, and the chief being 
<lb/>reported friendly to foreigners. If I succeed in reaching the west 
<lb/>coast and am permitted to return by this river, it will be water 
<lb/>conveyance for perhaps 2/3<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> of the way. We went therefore to the confluence 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Leeba</placeName> or <placeName>Londa</placeName> (not Lonta as we have written it) with the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is in 14° 11′ South. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <placeName>Leeba</placeName> comes from the N &amp; by W. or N. N. W. 
<lb/>while the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> there abruptly quits its Northing and comes from 
<lb/>the East Nor East. (the people pointed at its course due East. Are the 
<lb/><placeName><unclear cert="low">Maninche</unclear></placeName> or <placeName>Bashukulompo</placeName> river &amp; <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> not one river dividing 
<lb/>and meeting again down at the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>?). The <placeName>Loeti</placeName> with its light 
<lb/>coloured water flows into the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> in 14° 18′. It comes from 
<lb/><placeName>Lobale</placeName> which is probably a country through <add place="above">which</add> a Portuguese merchant 
<lb/>informed me he <add place="above">had</add> passed, and had to cross as many as ten considerable 
<lb/>rivers in one day. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <placeName>Loeti</placeName> comes from the West N. West<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The current of the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> is rapid - 100 yards in 60 seconds of time or 
<lb/>between 4 &amp; 5 miles an hour. Our elevation must have been 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>siderable</w> but I had to regret having no means of ascertaining how 
<lb/>much it was. The country flooded by the river ends on the west 
<lb/>bank before we reach the <placeName>Loeti</placeName> and there is an elevated table land 
<lb/>called <placeName>Mango</placeName>on which grows grass but no trees. The Barotse country 
<lb/>when inundated presents the appearance of a lake from 20 to 30 
<lb/>miles broad and 100 long. <!-- CODIC: Two lines indicating insert paragraph --> <add place="above" hand="#hand03"><unclear cert="low">K page 6</unclear></add><!-- TRANS: Not actually blockStrike.

<lb/>From all I can learn she did it gracefully and sincerely. Influential men 
<lb/>advised her to put <persName>Sekeletu</persName> to death lest he should become troublesome when he 
<lb/>became older. She turned from their proposals in disgust, called a meeting and 
<lb/>with a womanly gush of tears said she had been induced to rule by her 
<lb/>father but her own inclination had always been to lead a domestic life 
<lb/>she therefore requested <persName>Sekeletu</persName> to take the chieftainship and allow her to marry<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>He was equally sincere in a continued refusal during several days, for he was afraid 
<lb/>of being cut off by a pretender who had the audacity to utter some threatening words in the 
<lb/>assembly. I do not <add place="above" hand="#hand03">now</add> wonder at the resolution of <persName>Sebituane's</persName> daughter, having just come 
<lb/>off a nine weeks<reg>'</reg> tour in company with a crowd who would have been her courtiers<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>There was no want of food, oxen were slaughtered almost every day in numbers more 
<lb/>than sufficient for the wants of all. They were all as kind and attentive to me as they 
<lb/>could have been to her, yet to endure their dancing, roaring, and singing, their jesting 
<lb/>anecdotes, grumbling, quarrelling, murdering and <choice><sic>meaness</sic><corr>meanness</corr></choice>, equalled a pretty stiff 
<lb/>penance. These children of nature gave me a more intense disgust to Heathenism 
<lb/>and a much higher opinion of the effects of missions, among tribes in the South which 
<lb/>are reported to have been as savage as they, than I ever had before.</p>

<lb/>soon feeling disposed to retire for the evening, said to <persName>Sekeletu</persName> Where do we

<lb/>covering that of <persName>Sekeletu</persName> the attempt was not made - the accomplices

<lb/>answered <persName>Sekeletu</persName> "Take him off"<reg>.</reg> He was instantly led forth and executed. In a 
<lb/>hut close by. I knew nothing of it till the following day, others deeply implicated 
<lb/>were afterwards put to death in the same offhand way, and when I remonstrated 
<lb/>against shedding human blood, the counsellors calmly replied - "You see we are 
<lb/>still Boers, we are not yet taught." Another <add place="above" hand="#hand03">Portguese slave</add> merchant came from the West. He 
<lb/>remained here only three days and finding no market departed. A large party of 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Mambari</term> was encamped by <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand03">the town</del> <add place="above" hand="#hand03"><placeName>Katongo</placeName></add> about the time of our arrival <add place="above" hand="#hand03">at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName></add> - no

<lb/><placeName>Chobe</placeName>, they fled precipitately. The <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> remonstrated, saying, I would do 
<lb/>them no harm, but the <term type="tribe">Mambari</term> asserted that I would take all their

<lb/>He was very fond of rearing the young of wild animals in his town and

<lb/>a common compass.<!--editorial markings hand03--> <add place="marginleft" hand="#hand03">L</add> At one time <add place="above" hand="#hand03">as I mentioned before</add> I thought of going west in company with

<lb/><p>I am sorry to say that the Boers destroyed my celestial Map and thereby

<lb/>order that he may verify my Lunars. If I am not mistaken we 
<lb/>have placed our rivers &amp;c about 2° of Longitude too far East. Our 
<lb/>waggon stand instead of being 26° East is not more than 23° 50′ or 24°<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is probable that an error of my sextant of which I was not aware deranged 
<lb/>the calculations of the gentleman, who kindly undertook to examine them<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I send many Lunar observations too, and hope it may be convenient 
<lb/>for <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Maclear</persName> to examine them and let you know whether 
<lb/>I am right or wrong in my calculations. The map prepared by

<lb/>In the enclosed sketch you will see I give no more than I saw 
<lb/>I took the bearings of every reach of the river both in ascending and 
<lb/>descending &amp; allowing for the variation of the compass (21° West) reduced 
<lb/>the sketch according to the Latitudes and Longitudes obtained by 
<lb/>observations; I am not well satisfied with the reduction. I have 
<lb/>not been able to insert the islands and other remarks which would 
<lb/>convey information as well as the form of the river - but you will 
<lb/>see how nearly my sketch from actual observation agrees with 
<lb/>our map from Native information. But I shall send an unreduced 
<lb/>sketch in order that if you wish it a finer pen than mine may 
<lb/>reduce it. The watch performs remarkably well - though deranged for 
<lb/>some time by an unfortunate knock I think it will yet do good service. 
<lb/>If you know any one at <placeName>Loanda</placeName> on the West Coast send me a 
<lb/>thermometer graduated to shew the point of ebullition of water at different 
<lb/>heights but please remember not to lay out much on that which 
<lb/>may be lost. I should like to ascertain the water shed of the east &amp; west<reg>.</reg>

<lb/><p>Sportsmen have still some work before them in the way of discovering

<lb/>the herds of large animals surpass anything I ever saw. Elands and buffaloes 
<lb/>their tameness was shocking to me. 81 buffaloes defiled slowly before our 
<lb/>fire one evening and lions were impudent enough to roar at us. On the 
<lb/>South of the <placeName>Chobe</placeName> where Bushmen abound they are very seldom heard. 
<lb/>These brave fellows teach them better manners. My boatman informed me that 
<lb/>he had never seen an animal with <add place="above">long</add> wide spreading horns like an ox, called liombikalela 
<lb/>perhaps the Indian Bison or another animal which <del type="strikethrough">lives</del> <add place="above">does not live</add> in the water but snorts

<lb/>of a third animal which burrows from the river inland, has short horns 
<lb/>and feeds only by night. I did not notice the burrows at the time of passing 
<lb/>but I give you the report as I got it. Sable antelopes abound and so does the 
<lb/><anchor xml:id="envelopePosition" type="positionMarker"/>Nahong and there is a pretty little antelope on the Sesheke called "Teeanyane" which
