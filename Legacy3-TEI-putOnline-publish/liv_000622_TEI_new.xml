<lb/>the damp air comes from the

<lb/>He could scarcely breathe for one day - the
<lb/>mucus collected so abundantly in the <term type="bodypart">air

<lb/>of <term type="animal">wood pigeons</term> in his <term type="bodypart">breast</term>. That
<lb/>has been removed but no medicine has
<lb/>any effect on the complaint. He has
<lb/>constant <term type="ailment">heat of skin</term> - loses <term type="bodypart">flesh</term> &amp;
<lb/>is much troubled with his <term type="ailment">cough</term>
<lb/>Remedies which usually produce a

<lb/>the <term type="ailment">cough</term> gradually sounds worse &amp;
<lb/>worse. I am sorry I cannot

<lb/>I can only hope they will soon
<lb/>appear. His cheerfulness is quite gone</p>

<lb/>I have been shortening the bands of the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>
<lb/>succeeded well with those of the "naves"
<lb/>except making one rather too little. Three
<lb/>of the large bands fitted well But one did
<lb/>not touch the wood <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">at the weld</add> &amp; when trying to
<lb/>send it in (when cold) I broke it although
<lb/>the weld was one of the best made. I
<lb/>take it slowly welding one side then
<lb/>the other. What is the proper distance
<lb/>to place the band from the hole of the
<lb/>bellows? ought the centre of the band
<lb/>or the lower edge to be opposite
<lb/>the hole? I placed the band sometimes
<lb/>two sometimes three inches from the
<lb/>hole but could not get a heat over
<lb/>the whole part to be welded. It either
<lb/>went over the upper or lower edge
<lb/>My friends here say you put pieces of
<lb/>stone under the band to bring it into
<lb/>a proper position What that is I
<lb/><choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> ascertain - this sort of work
