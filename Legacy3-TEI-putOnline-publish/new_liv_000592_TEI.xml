<lb/>I heard at <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName> that <persName>Mary</persName> had <term type="ailment">headache</term>
<lb/>&amp; when the <orgName>Griqua</orgName> <term type="occupation">messenger</term> came I did not

<lb/>the children here come to be taught by <persName>Mary</persName> at 
<lb/>the house. <persName>Sechele</persName> acquired a perfect <w>know<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>ledge</w> of the alphabet, large small &amp; mixed 
<lb/>in two days. I try to get breakfast before 
<lb/>sun-rise &amp; keep school in the <foreign xml:lang="und">Kotla</foreign> as soon 
<lb/>after as possible so as to have all set agoing 
<lb/>in good time in the morning. I am extremely 
<lb/>sorry at having involved you in the unpleasant 
<lb/>affair with <persName>Edwards</persName>. It was entirely by a 
<lb/>mistake on my part. The appearance of 
<lb/>the man &amp; his communication produced 
<lb/>a sort of bewilderment and as we were 
<lb/>on the power of starting for <placeName><persName>Sechele</persName>'s</placeName> I  
<lb/>was willing to give him a frank statement 
<lb/>before we did so &amp; in doing so wrote with 
<lb/>more hurry than such a matter required 
<lb/>I read over yours hurriedly &amp; thought that 
<lb/>the paper was official and it was not 
<lb/>till a <unclear cert="low">&amp;c perusal</unclear> of yours convinced me
<lb/>I was wrong that I knew the error I 
<lb/>had made.  He however takes it 
<lb/>for granted that you have informed me 
<lb/>of everything for he begins his note by 
<lb/>"you have been informed that I applied &amp;c" 
<lb/>but he has not the <choice><sic>engenuity</sic><corr>ingenuity</corr></choice> to allow anything 

	

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000592_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>If he can make a peg of it on which to hang 
<lb/>an accusation, and by the way I may mention 
<lb/>that I have nothing to do with his application 
<lb/>for advice. The form in which he now 
<lb/>puts his absence from the ordinances &amp; station 
<lb/>we left this as he informed me in his note 
<lb/>in order to submit the affairs to a <orgName>committee</orgName> 
<lb/>of the <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice>. I do not feeling willing 
<lb/>to allow him to make turn rounds as he has 
<lb/>done in the affair. The charges as he now 
<lb/>puts them are <hi rend="underline">false</hi> Not one of them 
<lb/>has he put in a plain straightforward way 
<lb/>so I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> see what I can do except 
<lb/>give a fair straightforward narration of 
<lb/>all that I know on the subject. It 
<lb/>will be <unclear cert="low">prolix</unclear> but these "charges" <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice><w>con<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>tain</w> a tithe of the differences . . there is 
<lb/>not a word about the "dishonest <w>dishonour<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>able</w> mischievious conduct". "The going to 
<lb/><orgName>natives</orgName>" in the garden. The employing <persName>Mebaloe</persName>
<lb/>privately &amp;c &amp;c and by the way you need 
<lb/>not suspect the <orgName>Directors</orgName> will imagine 
<lb/>my declining to have <persName>Mokoteri</persName> in on 
<lb/>your account. My declining to employ 
<lb/>not only one but everyone I shall

	

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000592_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>attribute to one of the proper causes <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice>
<lb/>that there is not the least probability of my 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> that cooperation without which 
<lb/>my single efforts would be futile. Send 
<lb/><persName><unclear cert="medium">Paul</unclear></persName> to <persName>Poe</persName> and whatever your motives 
<lb/>may be in reality. Before twelve months 
<lb/>pass over you may have as I have 
<lb/>had from my beloved coadjutor all 
<lb/>manner of motives kindly laid at your 
<lb/>door. Unfortunately <bibl>my letters</bibl> for <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>are at <placeName><persName>Sechele</persName></placeName>. I shall leave that for 
<lb/>the <orgName>Directors</orgName> <supplied cert="high">to</supplied> open. Please peruse it &amp; 
<lb/>tell me what you think of it, I thought 
<lb/>at one time that I ought not to say a

<lb/>had decided. And that has made me delay 
<lb/><persName>Mokoteri</persName>'s affair longer than I intended 
<lb/>or wished. The subject of my <unclear cert="high">leaving</unclear>
<lb/>&amp; of <persName>Mebaloe</persName> &amp; of others are so connected 
<lb/>dovetailed I found I could not write 
<lb/>without taking them in. I hope your

<lb/>apply to this. If it does you may stop <unclear cert="medium">that</unclear>
<lb/>till you think proper

<lb/>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> sheet. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lemue</persName> seems rather sulky in his 
<lb/>answers to what I wrote - does not wish to 
<lb/>say anything more on the subject. I did not 
<lb/>wish him to begin. "<persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Langa</persName> thinks the

<lb/><p>We are very happy to hear that <persName>Robert</persName> tries to 
<lb/>improve. What he does is very commendable but 
<lb/>he seems to want a <term type="occupation">guide</term> in his studies, <bibl>his letter</bibl> 
<lb/>indicates considerable mental activity. We thank 
<lb/>you for the perusal. Many of his thoughts 
<lb/>would vanish as many of ours have as soon 
<lb/>as he breathed this pure atmosphere. the 
<lb/>lack of the material for mechanical operations 
<lb/>he does not know. But nothing is like the 
<lb/><term type="occupation">preaching</term> of the word. Dogged perserverance 
<lb/>at this is infinitely prefer<add place="above">r</add>able to <term type="occupation">doctoring</term> 
<lb/><term type="occupation">tinkering</term> or anything else. You have but a 
<lb/>small quantity of iron in the <placeName><region><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>district</region></placeName>, none at all I imagine in <placeName><region>Griqua<w><supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>land</w></region></placeName>. Copper has been worked very 
<lb/>extensively at <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName>, enormous <unclear cert="low">amounts</unclear>
<lb/>the labours of extraction have been. There 
<lb/>is abundance of iron ore here but would 
<lb/><persName>Robert</persName> like to be <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>'s <term type="occupation">mechanic</term>

<lb/>If he came out as an <term type="occupation"><choice><orig>artizan</orig><reg>artisan</reg></choice></term> I for one should 
<lb/>bitterly regret it and then who is to support him 
<lb/>in his <choice><sic>journies</sic><corr>journeys</corr></choice>? and his <hi rend="underline">wife</hi> too! But it is unfair 
<lb/>to criticise. they are the dreams - amiable speculations 
<lb/>of one who seems quite on the right side Let us 
<lb/>pray that he may be guided into the right path for 
<lb/>the Redeemer<supplied cert="high">'</supplied>s glory. And that he may yet 
<lb/>become instrumental in more good to <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>
