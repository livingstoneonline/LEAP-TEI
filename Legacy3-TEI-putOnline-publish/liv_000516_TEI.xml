<lb/><p rend="center">Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p>A period of twelve months has now<!-- "now' is struckthrough in another hand -->
<lb/>nearly elapsed since my arrival in the country of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>.
<lb/>And though during that time ample opportunities have been
<lb/>afforded me for ascertaining the real state of this mission,
<lb/>I have not <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> now felt it to be<!-- "to be" is struckthrough in another hand --> my duty to make
<lb/>any definite statement to the Directors respecting the
<lb/>amount of amelioration of which, by the devoted labours
<lb/>of the missionaries and Divine favour, the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>here have been the subjects. <space dim="horizontal" extent="4" unit="chars"/>And I am not at
<lb/>all sorry that I have refrained so long, for in gradually
<lb/>becoming conversant with their condition, some things
<lb/>exceeding and others falling within my expectations
<lb/>would probably have swayed my <choice><sic>judgement</sic><corr>judgment</corr></choice> &amp; prevented
<lb/>me coming to a calm conclusion, had I written sooner
<lb/>on this point. <space dim="horizontal" extent="4" unit="chars"/><choice><orig>Untill</orig><reg>Until</reg></choice> lately too, I was not
<lb/>fully aware of the proper point from which to 
<lb/>view the improvement which has been effected,
<lb/>We must not only be conversant with the present
<lb/>condition of the <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> converts. We must
<lb/>be intimately acquainted with others sunk low in
<lb/>the same depths of degradation, from which 
<lb/>these have been raised, before we can appreciate
<lb/>the magnitude of the change. <space dim="horizontal" extent="3" unit="chars"/>To me lately
<lb/>arrived<!-- "To me lately arrived" is struckthrough in another hand --> from <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> the condition of the
<lb/>converts presented many features of pleasing
<lb/>interest. But not <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> after I had visited the
<lb/>tribes in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> which may be called<!-- "which may be called" is struckthrough in another hand --> the 
<lb/>facsimilies of what the converts were, was I 
<lb/>able to see, in all their greatness, the wonderful works
<lb/>of the Lord.  This contrast between what they <!-- "what" is struckthrough in another hand -->

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000516_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>were, and have now become is most striking, and it
<lb/>forces on my mind with greater power than ever the
<lb/>conviction, that the gospel has lost none of its pristine
<lb/>efficacy. It is still, thanks be to the Lord, the power
<lb/>of God unto salvation, and the evidences of its<!-- "its" is struckthrough in another hand and "that" has been added above --> power
<lb/>which I here witness <!-- "at this station" has been added above in another hand --> will I believe make me cherish
<lb/>higher ideas than ever of the efficacy of the instrument
<lb/>with which <!-- "I" is struckthrough in another hand and "we" has been added above --> entrusted for turning the nation to God.</p>
<lb/><p>The number of those who give good evidence of a 
<lb/>decided change of heart, when compared with the amount 
<lb/>of population on the station, is very large, and we
<lb/>are delighted to behold from time to time large additions
<lb/>made to it. Many of these too<!-- "too" is struckthrough in another hand and "that" has been added above -->, are such as we
<lb/>should scarcely have expected to see made trophies
<lb/>of grace. These accessions are constituted of not only
<lb/>the young and vigorous, But the old and grey
<lb/>headed whose hearts had been subjected to a long
<lb/>course of induration, come forward as will, and
<lb/>profess their determination to devote even their
<lb/>eleventh hour to the service of Him who died
<lb/>for them. The Lord is indeed doing great
<lb/>things amongst us, and our hearts rejoice
<lb/>the works of <del>this</del><add place="inline">His</add> hands, I can the more
<lb/>freely hear testimony to the mighty effects which have
<lb/>and do still follow the faithful and devoted labours
<lb/>of my elder <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> in this place, as my
<lb/>instrumentality has in no way contributed to the
<lb/>result. And from my knowledge of the character
<lb/>of <choice><abbr>M<hi rend="sup">esrs</hi></abbr><expan>Messers</expan></choice><persName>Hamilton</persName> and <persName>Edwards</persName>, I believe in
<lb/>their communication to the Directors they must
<lb/>have always kept considerably within what they
<lb/>might have told of the progress of the cause of
<lb/><persName>Christ</persName> through their instrumentality -</p>
<lb/><p>One of the most pleasant features of the mission
<lb/>is the progress made by the children in the infant
<lb/>school under <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Edwards</persName>. Founded and (with only

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000516_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>only <choice><sic>occassional</sic><corr>occasional</corr></choice> assistance from one of the natives) carried
<lb/>on from its commencement entirely by herself, it <choice><orig>shews</orig><reg>shows</reg></choice> what
<lb/>an amount of influence may be exerted over a country by <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">the devotedness of</add> a
<lb/>single individual. The parents form a mighty <!-- "might" is struckthrough in another hand and "great" has been added above --> contrast with
<lb/>their fellow <choice><sic>country men</sic><corr>countrymen</corr></choice> still in darkness, and it is nearly
<lb/>as great between them and their children, indeed the
<lb/>intelligent expression of countenance visible even to strangers 
<lb/>and their amount of knowledge, would almost lead 
<lb/>one to fancy they belonged to another species, and I have
<lb/>no hesitation in asserting that if the efficient tuition
<lb/>of their instructress is in the arrangement of Providence<!-- "in the arrangement of Providence" is struckthrough in another hand and "that" has been added above -->
<lb/>continued to them, there will be as much difference between
<lb/>the intellectual development of children and parents, as
<lb/>we see between the physical development of our agricul<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb/>-tural and town population in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> - I look to 
<lb/>the infant school with particular satisfaction for it
<lb/>furnishes me with the hope that many with hearts
<lb/>embued with piety and minds capable of being
<lb/>stored with knowledge will spring up from it an<gap agent="damage" extent="1" unit="chars"/><supplied cert="high">d</supplied>
<lb/>go forth to make known in distant regions the <w>unsearch<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>able</w> riches of Christ.</p>
<lb/><p>It is with much pleasure I can thus bear my humble
<lb/>testimony to the efficiency of the <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> who have
<lb/>preceeded me in this part of the missionary field, and
<lb/>while I magnify the grace manifested both in and by<!-- "by" is struckthrough in another hand and "through" has been added above -->
<lb/>them, I pray to be enabled to walk with humility and zeal
<lb/>in their footsteps. May the same power which supported them
<lb/>ever uphold and cause me to be faithful -</p>
<lb/><p>The church is in a most flourishing condition, and though
<lb/>there are still some points in the character of the converts
<lb/>which require the exercise of charity and forbearance in
<lb/>us, a visible improvement is going on. It is not a
<lb/>stand still church. It is making headway against the
<lb/>world, and in several instances the truth is beginning
<lb/>to prevail over their selfish national character, the per-
<lb/>-son who conducted my <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> in one
<lb/>of my journies is an instance, for when I paid

<lb/>him eighteen dollars as wages he immediately laid down twelve
<lb/>as his subscription to the Auxiliary Missionary society. May
<lb/>the holy spirit be poured out on us more abundantly, so that
<lb/>the spirit of benevolence may be increased, and all the
<lb/>dark places of the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> soon feel its blessed effects.</p>
