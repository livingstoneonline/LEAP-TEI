<lb/><salute>My Dear Friend</salute></opener>              
<lb/><p>I am sure you have wondered again &amp; again why
<lb/>your seed box has been so long in making its appearance. The
<lb/>reason of the delay has been the isolation <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">to</add> which we have for
<lb/>a long time been subject. Even our <orgName><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> friends</orgName>
<lb/>were in ignorance of our welfare for about six months
<lb/>and the transmission of the box was an impossibility. The
<lb/>country has been very much disturbed of late. The <term type="tribe">Caffre</term> <!-- geog: --><!-- Adrian, same q on this letter for Africa/vs other region. HB --><!-- Leaving blank for now as default. Anne may be best positioned to fill in all the instances of a blank geog: . AW -->

<lb/>destruction of nearly all the mission stations &amp;c throughout
<lb/><placeName><region>Caffreland</region></placeName>. If I had sent sooner the whole of the contents
<lb/>would probably have been lost by delay on the frontiers of
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> - or perhaps they might have fallen into lawless
<lb/>hands. I need not say more about the delay except
<lb/>that in process of time it has grown from a small box

<lb/>Remember however to present my very warmest thanks
<lb/>to each of the above named friends &amp; everyone besides who
<lb/>may have placed me under obligation to do so - I am sorry
<lb/><supplied>I</supplied> have appeared lacking in the acknowledgement line. It
<lb/>certainly did not arise from want of gratitude and having
<lb/>given a general assurance of thankfulness when I heard of
<lb/>your projected kindnesses I thought I might wait till
<lb/>I saw the presents. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The majority of the articles sent never
<lb/>came. This loss was I believe mainly owing to their being
<lb/>packed in casks. Even very strong ones soon yield to
<lb/>the influence of the climate - the ends fall in and a strong
<lb/>temptation is placed in the way of <term type="occupation">carriers</term>. The box
<lb/>now sent will give you an idea of what does best
<lb/>for this country. If dove tailed &amp; a feather put into <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>the joinings such a box is just the thing. There is
<lb/>another box in it wrapped up in an old bag to prevent
<lb/>the charcoal in which the bulbs are packed from
<lb/>permeating <unclear cert="high">through</unclear> &amp; spoiling the <foreign xml:lang="und">Karosses</foreign>. The bulbs
<lb/>number upwards of twenty - but the varieties included
<lb/>may not amount to so many. The delay has brought
<lb/>them to the very "best" time of the year for conveyance
<lb/>It was winter when they were taken up and as most
<lb/>of them are very tenacious of life I think you will
<lb/>have some satisfaction from them. They are not
<lb/>in general covered with earth. A little more than
<lb/>half ought to do &amp; <del type="strikethrough">but</del> little water will suffice - the
<lb/>soil of all ought to contain <add place="above">a</add> considerable portion of
<lb/>sand, I should imagine no manure, <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetable</term> mould
<lb/>need not predominate. The soil is usually firmly baked
<lb/>around them whether by heat or rains I cannot tell
<lb/>You probably have some new plants as the botany of this
<lb/>region has never yet been explored. If you discover a <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>new one it must be called - <foreign xml:lang="und"><term type="plant">Whishii</term></foreign> - <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Moffat</persName> <!-- Adrian, not sure if this is a general term for plant thus does not need a tag, but added in case. HB --><!-- Looks OK to me. AW -->

<lb/><p>After a protracted search I cannot lay my hands on yours <w>con-

<lb/>now to keep my station going. It would be impossible to do with

<lb/>they cost nothing for grass - the herd gets one yearly. A pen made
<lb/>of <term type="plant">thorn bushes</term> is all their accommodation. To have plenty
<lb/>of <term type="foodstuff">milk</term> throughout the year we ought to have forty <term type="animal">cows</term>. This

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">nothing about them for two years. I think I mentioned the price
<lb/>of my <term type="animal">horse</term>. It was captured &amp; recaptured<supplied>.</supplied> I have it now
<lb/>It is very useful - by sending out our man to ride down a
<lb/><term type="animal">Giraffe</term> or <term type="animal">Eland</term> we get a good supply of meat Each of
<lb/>these animals is very good but the <term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term> is our most
<lb/>frequent fare. <persName>Baba</persName> a <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> convert was killed by
<lb/>one last week. Unprovoked it rushed on him &amp; ripped him up
<lb/><persName>Mebaloe</persName> &amp; I galloped off when we heard of the accident -
<lb/>A <term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term> disputed our passage and as it was midnight
<lb/>we were preserved only by Divine care. We saw a fire in 
<lb/>the distance &amp; believe it was <persName>Baba</persName> - a party made towards
<lb/>it We found that he had died the day before, &amp; his <w>com-
<lb break="no"/>panions</w> had gone on to lay his body in the dust at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>I cannot at present write you with the care I ought
<lb/>You must excuse me - I shall do better when our
<lb/>meeting house is finished I just now recollect another
<lb/>question - the cost of <add place="above">conveyance</add> <supplied>of</supplied> a case is defrayed by <orgName>the society</orgName> as
<lb/>far as <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName> - on this side <supplied>of</supplied> the <placeName><geogName type="river">Orange <choice><abbr>R.</abbr><expan>River</expan></choice></geogName></placeName> the expense is ours
<lb/>Suppose a case <unclear cert="low">10<choice><abbr>st</abbr><expan>stones</expan></choice></unclear>. It costs about 30 shillings from
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Algoa Bay</settlement></placeName> to <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName>. From <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName> to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> about
<lb/>£1 more &amp; then from <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> to <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName> about 10 shillings
<lb/>I do not know the freight by sea</p>
<lb/><p>I thank you most heartily for the medicines you
<lb/>sent - they are excellent. The gentleman you bought them
<lb/>of has acted conscientiously. There was no trash in the box. It
<lb/>came most opportunely I was nearly out of some articles
<lb/>I have seen boxes of medicines sent out to this country <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>(value £10 - £12) &amp; nothing in them of value - the price was
<lb/>made up by as much <term type="medicament">sulphur</term> as would have cured all
<lb/><placeName><region>Argyleshire</region></placeName> of the <term type="ailment">itch</term> (&amp; we have none of it here) &amp; <term type="medicament">salts</term> &amp; <term type="medicament">senna</term>

<lb/>But yours are most judiciously selected &amp; I
<lb/>thank you most sincerely for your kindness</p>
<lb/><p>This is no <bibl><term type="occupation">missionary</term> letter</bibl> &amp; the fault
