<lb/>is increased when I reflect that I shall
<lb/>not have any opportunity of attending to your

<lb/>request till the middle of next year and I am not
<lb/>at all sure that I shall have such another opportunity
<lb/>even then. For I do not know whether in
<lb/>the event of making another trip I shall have
<lb/>companions who possess <term type="animal">horses</term> for hunting. It
<lb/>is more probable I shall have native companions
<lb/>alone. And I am unwilling to raise your
<lb/>expectations as to the result.</p>
<lb/><p>I never observed any <term type="insect">parasitical insects</term> on
<lb/>the <term type="animal">Elephant</term> or <term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term> except a kind of
<lb/><term type="insect">worm</term> between the eyeball &amp; lid in the latter. Yet
<lb/>it must have some for I have very seldom
<lb/>seen a <term type="animal">rhinoceros</term> without some birds on
<lb/>its back which probably feed<del type="strikethrough">s</del> on such insects
<lb/>We know the bird chiefly as giving warning
<lb/>to the animal when any one is approaching
<lb/>I have observed the different kinds of <term type="ailment"><term type="animal">intestinal
<lb/>worms</term></term> in the bowels of the <term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term> &amp;
<lb/><term type="animal">Zebra</term>. In the former they are enormous
<lb/>in size &amp; very numerous. On the <term type="animal">wild pig</term>
<lb/>a small kind of <term type="insect">flea</term> abounds. A smaller
<lb/>kind is found on the <term type="animal_foodstuff">domestic fowl</term> &amp; <term type="animal_foodstuff">goat</term>
<lb/>A kind of <term type="insect">tick</term> abounds in some parts of

<pb facs="liv_000688_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>the country and it must infest some kinds of
<lb/>game for when we sit down under a tree
<lb/>we often see them marching up to us. I never
<lb/>saw it except on <term type="animal_foodstuff">oxen</term> &amp; <term type="animal">dogs</term>. It occasionally
<lb/>commences operations on man. Half a dozen 
<lb/><add place="inspace" rend="small">fastening on the organs of generation</add>
<lb/>will kill a young animal. <term type="animal">Dogs</term> are infested
<lb/>with a <term type="insect">fly</term> under the neck as well. One like
<lb/>the <term type="insect">common flea</term> the other much larger
<lb/>If numerous they kill <term type="animal">whelps</term></p>
<lb/><p>But the fly called "<term type="insect">tsetse</term>" beats all others
<lb/>hollow. It is about the size of the <term type="insect">common
<lb/>house fly</term> but has four or five yellow bars
<lb/>across the after part of the body. Its bite
<lb/>is fatal to <term type="animal_foodstuff">oxen</term> <term type="animal">horses</term> &amp; <term type="animal">dogs</term> but has no
<lb/>effect whatever in man, <term type="animal_foodstuff">goats</term> &amp;c &amp;c<!-- I am not sure how to code &c. Please advise. JM --><!-- See what I've done. AW --> I have
<lb/>seen several animals which have been
<lb/>bitten and they immediately begin to lose
<lb/>flesh and gradually decline till they perish
<lb/>from mere exhaustion. A <term type="animal">horse</term> of mine
<lb/>underwent the wasting process during a period
<lb/>of 6 months, generally however the first
<lb/>rain that falls after being bitten hastens
<lb/>their dissolution. Several travellers have had
