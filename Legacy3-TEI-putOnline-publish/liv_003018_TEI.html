<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">Mabotsa</span> <span class="">5 June 1844</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> M<span class="sup ">c</span>Robert</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                </span>I expected to have heard from you long before this 
<br/>as it is now the fourth time I have written you and considerable intervals have
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>always elapsed between each.  But though hope deferred maketh the 
<br/>heart sick I cannot say mine is in that state yet, and perhaps the 
<br/>reason is we in this outlandish region are so constantly obliged to defer 
<br/>our hopes we at last become used to the employment.- I shall now 
<br/>give you some account of what is doing here <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">in order</span> that you may understand  
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>we are not unmindful of our obligations to your exertions. And first 
<br/>of all I may mention that your agent <span class="">Mebaloe</span> (alias <span class="">David Molehane</span>) 
<br/>has since we came to this sphere of labour given us entire satisfaction 
<br/>in all the operations requiring manual labour he has worked with us 
<br/>in a manner which shews he is in earnest and his addresses to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>his countrymen are characterized by good sense, affection and 
<br/>faithfulness. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> took him lately to a number of 
<br/>villages situated near the <span class="">Kureechane</span> in order to introduce him 
<br/>to the people and I intend in a day or two to do the same in a 
<br/>number of villages of the Makone situated North East of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>us. There are about a dozen villages around us, some of them 
<br/>of considerable size and situated conveniently for itinerary 
<br/>to which we intend paying stated visits. <span class="">Mébaloe</span> will take a part 
<br/>in this labour and we hope the Lord will incline the hearts of his country- 
<br/>-men to listen to the words of life from his mouth. A long continued 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>application of the truth to their minds seems the only mode by 
<br/>which <span class="del cancelled">at</span> by the Divine blessing it can find its way to their hearts 
<br/>their minds are so thoroughly absorbed by what is seen they never once 
<br/>bestow a thought on what is invisible.  Every motion of their souls 
<br/>has a reference to earth &amp; to that only.  and as this has been the case 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>from generation to generation they seem to have sunk as far as 
<br/>human nature can go. At one period they seem to have worshipped 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>animals But if I am not wrong in my conjecture that idolatry degener<br/>-ated so far that only the mere vestiges of it now remain, these rem<br/>-nants of animal worship are the facts that each tribe is called by the 
<br/>name of an animal, By it they swear, In general neither kill nor eat 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>it, Sometimes they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> look at it &amp; say it is the friend of their tribe 
<br/>thus the name Bakhatla is literally <span class="underline ">they</span> (of the) <span class="underline ">monkey</span>, Battapi, <span class="underline ">they</span>
<br/>(of the) <span class="underline ">Fish</span>, the Bakwain, they of the crokodileBachuéne they of 
<br/>the Baboon. The Barolong if asked by what they swear invariably 
<br/>answer "we dance to iron", and in hunting they kill a khoodoo, a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>magnificent animal of the antelope kind invariably make loud 
<br/>lamentations before commencing to flay it. As yo yo yo we have 
<br/>killed our father,  yo yo yo &amp;c. believing if they do not make a sort 
<br/>of weeping some of them will die in consequence of the neglect 
<br/>But whether animal worship was formerly prevalent among them 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>or not they now give that place in their affections so entirely 
<br/>to the creature which belongs to the Creator they know of nothing 
<br/>superior to the possession of oxen &amp; plenty of milk from their cows 
<br/>their depravity seems subnatural and a considerable time appears to 
<br/>be required before they are raised to the level of sinners in other countries 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>this view may be the effect of my unbelief but we find that 
<br/>conversion is always a slow process among Bechuanas
<br/>In the <span class="">Lattakoo</span> district the gospel has effected wonders on the 
<br/>whole population so much so indeed they are not to be compared 
<br/>to the Bakhatla. You will of course understand when I speak of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>a change effected on the whole population I do not refer to the 
<br/>new phases of character which the gospel has developed in 
<br/>believers But to the unconverted and to those other than saving 
<br/>influences of Christianity which so materially modify the 
<br/>social system at home. There the general conviction has 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>been produced that there is a God, that man has some 
<br/>relationship to Him - that this life is but the beginning of our 
<br/>existence and death but one event in a life which is ever- 
<br/>-lasting - there are still a great want in the moral feeling and 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>strange stupor &amp; somnolence of conscience But compared to what 
<br/>they were and what the Bakhatla now are the former are enlightened 
<br/>&amp; civilized. Yet even at <span class="">Lattakoo</span> the process of conversion 
<br/>is slow. A not much quicker rate obtains than there was in the churches 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Haugh</span> &amp; <span class="">Wardlaw</span> when I was in <span class="">Glasgow</span>. (O these good 
<br/>men, my heart warms to them everytime I look up at their portraits 
<br/>I seem to hear their voices yet even in the still still quietness of the 
<br/>desert. words from some ministers enter right into the soul and 
<br/>glow there for ever. O that I had the tongue of the learned &amp; wisdom 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to win souls) It is the greatness of the change - Christianity transforming 
<br/>Bechuanas (I have not a word expressive of the extreme of degradation) into 
<br/>men, that constitutes the wonderful cause for gratitude. I believe 
<br/>it is a greater miracle than instantaneous cure of the blind would 
<br/>be to them. It arrests more attention than any physical change 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I have occasionally been called to cases of imminent danger 
<br/>and the disease simulating another had I not had the benefit of the 
<br/><span class="del cancelled">the</span> <span class="add  above">familiar instructions of</span> most eminent medical men in <span class="">London</span> I should probably have 
<br/>mistaken complaint &amp; treatment &amp; the case ended fatally. But 
<br/>proper treatment here administered restoration to health quickly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>followed But notwithstanding that and my having travelled 40 miles 
<br/>sometimes sixty under a burning sun &amp; spending nearly the whole 
<br/>of several nights watching in their huts, <span class="add  above">besides providing medicine</span> the cure instead of arresting  
<br/>attention scarcely secured thanks from the individual But let a 
<br/>man turn from his evil ways to serve the Lord <span class="del cancelled">and</span> the whole 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>country hears of it. The good are glad &amp; the wicked <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span>under- 
<br/>-stand the folly of the man who has ceased to follow the customs 
<br/>of his ancestors. they are not all insensible to the benefits they 
<br/>have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> by medicine But while that does much to secure their 
<br/>attention &amp; sometimes affection the Holy Spirit gives more power<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>-ful testimony to the truth of the gospel by the conversion of souls 
<br/>than we could give by the possession of the power of working 
<br/>miracles. Pray we beseech you that He may work mightily among 
<br/>the Bakhatla &amp; surrounding tribes --- My life was mercifully spared 
<br/>when in danger by the jaws of a lion, <span class="">Mebaloe</span> nearly lost his in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>his faithful endeavours to save me, both of <span class="add  above">us</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> were much hurt, he 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>in the thigh &amp; I in the shoulder &amp; arm, the bone of the latter being smashed 
<br/>to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: pieces">peices</span> and twelve gashes besides. But through the tender mercy of 
<br/>our God we are both now quite well May the spared lives be entirely 
<br/>devoted to the glory of our Great Deliverer. It was he who saved and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>he who healed my wounds Blessed be his glorious name for ever &amp; ever
<br/>I think I mentioned several objections against sending clothes to the 
<br/>people of this country for gratuitous distribution, these do not apply 
<br/>to those lately brought by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span>, they will be given as rewards 
<br/>for labour on the station &amp; will besides giving a taste of civilization 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>save the funds of the society &amp; wont destroy their feeling of independence 
<br/>so as to make them any greater beggars than they naturally are
	<br/>
<br/>And now my dear Friend I must bid you again farewell. May you 
<br/>both be favoured with every needed blessing Yours affectionately</p>
