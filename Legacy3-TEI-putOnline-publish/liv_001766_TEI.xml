<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Lord Kinnaird</persName>
<lb/><space extent="4" unit="words"/>You may have been 
<w>sur-<lb break="no"/>prised</w><add place="above">to</add> hear of the death of <persName>Bishop MacKenzie</persName>
<lb/>by the same mail with my last letter containing 
<lb/>no forebodings of such a loss. The time between 
<lb/>our <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> the news, and the departure of 
<lb/>the mail was so short that I could not let 
<lb/>you know that our anticipations of a 
<lb/>healthy and successful mission had been 
<lb/>disappointed. I prevented the bishop's party 
<lb/>from landing for three months. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen took 
<lb/>them up to the healthy highlands, but after 
<lb/>exposing themselves for days together to 
<lb/>rain in going to punish a chief who had 
<lb/>maltreated two of the party, the bishop and 
<lb/>another returned to the lowlands, was 
<lb/>upset in his canoe in a marsh losing 
<lb/>bedding medicine &amp;c. &amp; perished - the place 
<lb/>selected for their settlement has turned 
<lb/>out unhealthy. It was shaded by magnificent 
<lb/>trees and surrounded on three sides by 
<lb/>a fine stream about 10 yards wide. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>poor bishop admired the trees exceedingly 
<lb/>and would allow none to be cut down.</p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut having about 140 freed captives the 
<lb/>absence of sanitary regulations <add place="above">and air</add>made the 
<lb/>place become like a huge cesspool. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>missionaries speak of it as a "pest hole". 
<lb/>Scarcity of provisions followed a period 
<lb/>in which there was an absolute glut from 
<lb/>the whole population sending their surplus 
<lb/>stores to the mission - <term type="ailment">dysentry</term> ensued &amp; 
<lb/>some 30 of the freed people died - To people 
<lb/>living in such an unhealthy atmosphere 
<lb/>the smallest <term type="ailment">scratch</term> became a frightful 
<lb/><term type="ailment">ulcer</term>. The missionaries did all they 
<lb/>could for the people except removing to a 
<lb/>spot having free circulation of air, and 
<lb/>suffered in their own health. It is no 
<lb/>wonder that some of them feel discouraged 
<lb/>and 
<lb/><!-- nothing missing here - he just ends mid sentence --></p>
<lb/><p><date when="1862-05-08">8<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> May</date><reg>.</reg> I had written thus much by the 
<lb/>sick bed of my wife when the saddest 
<lb/>event of my life put it out of my head. 
<lb/>On <date when="1862-04-27">27<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi></date> I had to part with my good and 
<lb/>faithful companion of eighteen years whom 
<lb/>I married for love and the longer I had her 
<lb/>I loved her the more. It is the first 
<w>heart-<lb break="no"/>stroke</w> I have experienced and seems to take the 
<lb/>spirit out of me, and to blacken all 
<lb/>my horizon. Everything else that happened 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001766_0003"/><!--pb/@n='03'-->
<lb/>to me only made my mind rise with a 
<lb/>determination to overcome. All our longings 
<lb/>for one day having a quiet home are 
<lb/>now gone. She is, I trust through Divine 
<lb/>mercy, in the home of the Blest, for she 
<lb/>was a good though often dejected christian<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>You will excuse my saying so much 
<lb/>of a personal nature. </p>
<lb/><p>Our steamer for <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> came out 
<lb/>in pieces instead of sailing out as I had 
<lb/>arranged that she should do. It was 
<lb/>feared that in sailing out she might be 
<lb/>lost and my plan which involved 
<lb/>exposure in the delta of three or four 
<lb/>days was, no doubt with the best 
<lb/>intentions, departed from for one 
<lb/>which has kept us in the Delta four 
<lb/>months. But I do not feel much regret 
<lb/>for the change of plan compared to 
<lb/>the loss we have sustained by the engines 
<lb/>of the Pioneerbeing out of order - For 
<lb/><persName>Commander Wilson </persName> of H.M.S. Gorgon 
<lb/>who is well known to <persName>Admiral Hope</persName>
<lb/>volunteered to help us up the <placeName>cataracts</placeName>
<lb/>and all seemed to promise a speedy 
<lb/>departure from the lowlands but 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001766_0004"/><!--pb/@n='04'-->
<lb/>the engineer of the Pioneer had neglected his 
<lb/>duty. The engines were full of sand &amp; 
<lb/>we were three weeks in getting up to 
<lb/><placeName>Shupanga</placeName> which we have done before &amp; 
<lb/>since with as heavy a load in two &amp; 
<lb/>a half days. We were then obliged to unload 
<lb/>and put the steamer together at the most 
<lb/>unhealthy part of the river. While trying to 
<lb/>vow to the Almighty Disposer of events it 
<lb/>is impossible not to feel regret that 
<lb/>we have not been able to take advantage 
<lb/>of the knowledge which we imparted to 
<lb/>the Portuguese - their last detachment 
<lb/>of soldiers was sent up <add place="above">at once</add> to <placeName>Tette</placeName> and they 
<lb/>have lost but two in two years. While 
<lb/>formerly when they kept them down at 
<lb/><placeName>Quillimane</placeName> and <placeName>Senna</placeName>they were 
<lb/>invariably nearly all cut off. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>Rae</persName> put the shell of the steamer 
<lb/>together in a fortnight. I am carrying the 
<lb/>rest of her from <placeName>Kongone</placeName> to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>and we hope to go up <placeName>Shire</placeName> in <date when="1862-06">June</date>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>Portuguese say nothing to us about the 
<lb/>captives we freed and we of course don<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>introduce the subject. We hope to do something 
<lb/>towards a permanent stoppage of the trade 
<lb/>from <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> of 19000 <orgName>slaves</orgName> to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>
<lb/>as soon as we get on the Lake<reg>.</reg> David Livingstone </p>
