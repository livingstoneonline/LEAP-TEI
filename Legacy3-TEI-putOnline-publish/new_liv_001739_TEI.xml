<lb/>astounding, yet, though far from supposing

<lb/>as he did in former years when I was alone
<lb/>He was by no means popular, and was believed

<lb/>are by no means so tongue-tied there as they
<lb/>are under <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>, yet not at <placeName><settlement type="town">Sesheke</settlement></placeName> and
<lb/><placeName><region>Linyanti</region></placeName> alone did they speak well of our
<lb/>departed friend but on the <placeName><region>East coast</region></placeName>
<lb/>utterance was given occasionally to expressions

<lb/>the son of a man who escaped execution in

<lb/>difference of social position to which you
<lb/>refer was not viewed by the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> as
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> may have looked upon it -</p>

	<cb rend="vertical"/><ab>
<lb/>very heartily for your kind wishes and <bibl>letter</bibl> and also for the <bibl>Report</bibl></ab>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">for in speaking kindly of <persName>Helmore</persName>, they often
<lb/>remarked "he was just like you a man with
<lb/>a heart" i-e. a kind man.</p>
<lb/><p>It was also very painfully apparent that no
<lb/>feelings of respect were entertained towards
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Price</persName>. I have refrained from saying a
<lb/>word to anyone on this point but yourself -
<lb/>Thus, while <persName>Helmore</persName> was represented as <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice>
<lb/>supplies of <term type="foodstuff">meat</term> "<persName>Price</persName> might ask long enough
<lb/>before he got any." And <persName>Helmore</persName> was said to
<lb/>have declared after the death of his wife "that
<lb/><persName>Price</persName> being a child might return, but he (<choice><abbr>H.</abbr><expan>Helmore</expan></choice>)
<lb/>never would go back, but proceed onward
<lb/>as soon as I came whether his elders had
<lb/>sent him." The question was put repeatedly
<lb/>Why was <persName>Helmore</persName> not taken to the <placeName><region>Highlands</region></placeName> - <!-- geog: Shire Highlands -->
<lb/>and the answer was just what I gave you -
<lb/>It is notorious that only two influential men
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">in the tribe</del> object to the whole tribe removing
<lb/>thither and the general belief was that had
<lb/>he lived a little longer <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> <choice><abbr>H.</abbr><expan>Helmore</expan></choice></persName> would have led
<lb/>them to the <placeName><region>South East</region></placeName>. We never heard a syllable
<lb/>to his disadvantage but we overheard one man
<lb/>tell another <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">who had come from <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName></add> that having gone to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> <choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Price</expan></choice></persName>'s <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>
<lb/>while the latter was at a meal he was kicked
<lb/>away, and he added "Had <persName>Sekeletu</persName> not been
<lb/>there by -- I would have fought with him -"
<lb/>Some remarks made at a public meeting
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">about binding a man to his <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> wheel &amp;c</add> and fortunately unreported
<lb/>in the <bibl>papers</bibl> - and a statement about using
<lb/>his revolver with the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> made at the
<lb/><orgName>Royal Observatory</orgName> before going into the country
<lb/>at all lead me to make some abatement</p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">as to the colouring without questioning <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> <choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Price</expan></choice></persName>'s
<lb/>veracity. It was abundantly evident that he
<lb/>had failed to secure the respect of either <term type="occupation">chief</term>
<lb/>or <orgName>people</orgName>. This is no justification of any
<lb/>wrong the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> may have committed,
<lb/>but it is remarkable, if they <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> no
<lb/>provocation, that they should <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> so
<lb/>much rapacity towards <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Price</persName>, and leave
<lb/>my goods safely in my <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> &amp; in their
<lb/>huts though the boxes are unlocked.</p>
<lb/><p>As to the further prosecution of this mission
<lb/>I am very glad to see in your <bibl>Report</bibl> since
<lb/>I began this <bibl>letter</bibl> that you still look hopefully
<lb/>forward. I grieve over the loss this
<lb/>country has sustained in the departure of
<lb/>our brother to his rest. Nine <term type="people">Englishmen</term>
<lb/>have died in that country since the discovery
<lb/>of <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Ngami</geogName></placeName> - One perished by trying to save
<lb/>a <term type="animal">duck</term> in the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zouga</geogName></placeName> - Another, with his <term type="occupation">servant</term>,
<lb/>was lost under suspicion of foul play - Another
<lb/>ran madly under the feet of an <term type="animal">elephant</term> -
<lb/>and others blew themselves up with gunpowder
<lb/>the tenth, with his wife, lies at <placeName><region>Linyanti</region></placeName> &amp;
<lb/>of the whole he alone had an object worth
<lb/>risking his life for. There, without a tree
<lb/>within a hundred yards to mark the spot, he
<lb/>rests from his labours, as good and as
<lb/>devoted a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> as ever left <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>.
<lb/>I collected a few bones &amp; placed <choice><sic>him</sic><corr>them</corr></choice> over his
<lb/>head - there is not a stone in the country - but
<lb/>these will soon vanish and his memory
<lb/>will remain only in men's hearts - I still
<lb/>feel convinced that a flourishing mission might
<lb/>be established <del type="cancelled">there</del> by a judicious <term type="occupation">missionary</term></p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">P.S. It has occurred to me to add that the
<lb/>treatment we <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> was not the effect
<lb/>of presents as each of the men from
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> had a load of his own and they
<lb/>would not carry much for us or their
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term>. We abstained from complaining
<lb/>of this as it would have caused
<lb/>the confiscation of all their <w>hard<supplied>-</supplied>
