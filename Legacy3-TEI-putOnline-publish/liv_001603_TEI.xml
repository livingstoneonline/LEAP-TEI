<lb/>to me since I came back to Africa 
<lb/>dated 26 July /59 was waiting my 
<lb/>arrival here a few days ago. We 
<lb/>had been up the River to the Makololo 
<lb/>country - and tramped 600 miles 
<lb/>in three months. Then some 800 more 
<lb/>in canoes &amp; on foot on our return 
<lb/>We were very glad to see our old 
<lb/>friends again but I was saddened 
<lb/>considerably by finding a party 
<lb/>of London missionaries had 
<lb/>perished as we suppose of <term type="ailment">Fever</term>
<lb/>at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>. My regret was the 
<lb/>greater on remembering that we 
<lb/>were curing <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">at the time they were dying</add> very severe cases of the

<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> &amp; <persName>Charles</persName> resuming their 
<lb/>march on foot even at the very longest 
<lb/>2 days after the medicine operated. And 
<lb/>I found the proper medicines in my 
<lb/>waggon about 500 yards from the 
<lb/>spot where the missionaries perished. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he mode of using them too is mentioned 
<lb/>near the end of "<!--<xref doc="MT-ID">-->Missionary Travels<!--</xref>-->" 
<lb/>Our <persName>Tom</persName> was the first I ever tried 
<lb/>the powder on, at <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> in 1850 
<lb/><persName>Agnes</persName> got it too and so did a party of 
<lb/>Englishmen one of whom died before 
<lb/>we arrived. The people had taken 
<lb/>kindly to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Helmore</persName> who was really 
<lb/>a good man &amp; most devoted missionary 
<lb/>I grieve much over his departure

<lb/>but the Head of the church doeth all 
<lb/>things well. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he chief was afflicted 
<lb/>with what is considered <term type="ailment">Leprosy</term>, 
<lb/>and several of his most influential 
<lb/>headmen suffered death for bewitching 
<lb/>him. We were curing him when 
<lb/>obliged to leave, but time is requisite 
<lb/>for complete cure. I question if it 
<lb/>is real <term type="ailment">leprosy</term>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he people are 
<lb/>the most interesting I know, and 
<lb/>I was sorely blamed for not bringing

<lb/>presence of one of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat's</persName> family 
<lb/>would secure them from attack 
<lb/>by <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>. I hope that they 
<lb/>will not be left untaught though

<lb/>We are to have a new ship. Verily
