<lb/>we are <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">not</add> aware whether in the hurry of parting 
<lb/>you bestowed a thought on us - But 
<lb/>feeling persuaded that you will be  
<lb/>disposed to aid us <choice><sic>whever</sic><corr>wherever</corr></choice> you are, I beg 
<lb/>your attention to the question of free 
<lb/>navigation on this river which I have 
<lb/>brought before <persName>Lord John Russell</persName> - The 
<lb/><term type="people">Portuguese</term> make no use of the <placeName><geogName type="river">river Zambesi</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>below this point, nor have they ever 
<lb/>ascended the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName> more than a few miles 
<lb/>above the confluence - their line of 
<lb/>exploration ran across country from 
<lb/><placeName>Sofala</placeName> to <placeName><settlement type="town">Senna</settlement></placeName>, and then down to <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName>. 
<lb/>The <term type="occupation">Governor</term> of <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> acknowledges in a

<lb/>Argus</bibl> in <date when="1859-08">August last</date>, that we are the first 
<lb/>that ever came from the sea to that district 
<lb/>by the mouths of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> - Now I would 
<lb/>not object to own their lordship over

<lb/>parts known or traded to by them, but 
<lb/>we have opened a new region by going 
<lb/>up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName>; and <persName>Burton</persName> &amp; <persName>Speke</persName> have 
<lb/>explored that region still farther, and 
<lb/>confirmed what we advanced respecting 
<lb/>the form and fertility of the country, as 
<lb/>well as the disposition of the inhabitants: 
<lb/>And it seems feasible to suppose that 
<lb/><term type="nationality">English</term> settlers in that Highland region<!-- geog: Shire Highlands --> 
<lb/>would both <choice><sic>develope</sic><corr>develop</corr></choice> the trade in <term type="plant_foodstuff">cotton</term>, 
<lb/>and soon stop the supply of <orgName>slaves</orgName> to 
<lb/>various ports on the <placeName><region>East coast</region></placeName> - 
<lb/>I am so fully persuaded of this, that 
<lb/>should the <orgName>Government</orgName> not grant 
<lb/>the means of placing a small steamer 
<lb/>on <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> to afford protection to settlers

<lb/>free passage in to our discoveries; and 
<lb/>our success without diminishing their 
<lb/>territory an inch, would promote the 
<lb/>prosperity of their establishments - You 
<lb/>will appreciate my earnestness in this 
<lb/>matter when you remember that their 
<lb/>settlements are not colonies, but small 
<lb/>penal settlements entailing a loss of £5000 
<lb/>or £6000 annually on the mother country, 
<lb/>and sending not a particle of trade home; 
<lb/>and never a single <orgName>African</orgName> made fortune 
<lb/>to be spent there. The <orgName>Governors</orgName>, no matter 
<lb/>what professions they make all get as 
<lb/>much into their pockets from <orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> <term type="occupation">traders</term></orgName> 
<lb/>as possible. The present <persName><term type="occupation">Governor General</term> 
<lb/>of <placeName><country><choice><orig>Mosambique</orig><reg>Mozambique</reg></choice></country></placeName></persName> - an educated &amp; enlightened

<lb/><term type="nationality">French</term> <orgName>slave</orgName> emigration from near <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>for two years - and then when the affair 
<lb/>of the Charles &amp; Georges caused a stir in

<lb/>the "<bibl>Boletin of Mozambique</bibl>" of those who 
<lb/>carried it on. It was carried on under 
<lb/>the very eye of the <persName><term type="occupation">Governor</term> of <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName></persName>. 
<lb/>It was well known to His <persName>Excellency of

<lb/>one expected, has now returned to <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>to carry on the same or a worse system - 
<lb/>People here talk openly of the <term type="occupation">Governors</term> 
<lb/>being bribed to allow these things - and from 
<lb/>all I have seen of the <term type="occupation">officials</term>, I feel certain 
<lb/>that they would hamper a movement 
<lb/>such as I propose by every means in 
<lb/>their power - We want only free access 
<lb/>by harbours and parts of the river of 
<lb/>which the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> make no use 
<lb/>whatever - to parts quite beyond their 
<lb/>trade and even geographical knowledge - </p>
<lb/><p><choice><sic>then</sic><corr>Then</corr></choice> their numbers are so small 
<lb/>if we exclude the <orgName>military</orgName> there are not 
<lb/>20 real <term type="people">Portuguese</term> on the river and 
<lb/>only 150 or 200 <orgName>half casts</orgName>. <placeName><country>Portugal</country></placeName> does 
<lb/>not intend to send colonists - those 
<lb/>actually sent are a class of military 
<lb/>called "<orgName>Incorrigibles</orgName>" and the chief trade 
<lb/>which is only paltry <term type="occupation">peddling</term> in ivory

<lb/>for the benefit of these men - No women 
<lb/>are sent out, and frightful immorality is 
<lb/>the consequence - I say little about them 
<lb/>publicly, because I have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> much

<lb/><persName>Lord John Russell</persName>, and if you can say a 
<lb/>word in behalf of urging a more open 
<lb/>system on the <term type="people">Portuguese</term>, you will confer 
<lb/>a great favour = I do not know 
<lb/>whether a silent system might work

<lb/>of the whole population when they see 
<lb/>whither our efforts tend in eating out 
<lb/>the <orgName><orgName>slave</orgName> trade</orgName> - They are rather glad at 
<lb/>having cleverly as they think, restricted my

<lb/>state and conveyed to <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Tette</orig><reg>Tete</reg></choice></settlement></placeName>) has entailed 
<lb/>ignorance of the intentions of <orgName>Government</orgName> 
<lb/>respecting the "Bann" which my <term type="occupation">Naval

<lb/>If we get a powerful vessel we intend

<lb/>a river which is said to flow out of it, 
<lb/>and to be navigable <measure>100 leagues</measure> inland - 
<lb/>It is beyond <placeName><region><term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> territory</region></placeName>, and from 
<lb/>its situation on the map appears to be about

<lb/>of that Lake</region></placeName>. It has a <measure>depth of three fathoms</measure> <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
