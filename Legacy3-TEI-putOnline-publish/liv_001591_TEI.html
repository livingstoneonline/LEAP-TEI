<br/>
<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">    </span>My Dear <span class="">General Hay</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                </span><span class="space">  </span>It was extremely 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>kind in you to remember me, 
<br/>as you have done. I have had good 
<br/>reason to remember you, and 
<br/>though you have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> no 
<br/>evidence of it again &amp; again and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>again has it been brought to my 
<br/>recollection how much I owe 
<br/>to you and your delightful home 
<br/>in the <span class="">Mauritius</span>. Indeed you 
<br/>set me so completely up, that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>all the tear &amp; wear of a fearful 
<br/>lionizing, though it wearied me 
<br/>sorely, never broke me down, 
<br/>and I have not had one 
<br/>severe attack of fever since 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>my return. Had I gone home 
<br/>at once in 1856 and gone through 
<br/>the terrible ordeal, then come out 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>I could not have done the work I do 
<br/>now. We have just finished a 
<br/>march of 1400 miles in six months. 
<br/>We went up the river in order to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>return the Makololo to their own land 
<br/>keeping along the North bank of the 
<br/><span class="">Zambesi</span> till we were in Lat. 17º 18′ South 
<br/>and about 28º East Long. then turned 
<br/>away Westward ascending the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Highlands near <span class="">Tabacheu</span> where 
<br/>we saw hoar frost &amp; a little ice 
<br/>then descended Westwards into the 
<br/>great central valley, to our old friends 
<br/>the Makololo. When within 20 miles 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of the Falls which I named after our 
<br/>Queen we saw the columns of smoke 
<br/>and went down to see this great 
<br/>sight. I have no hesitation now 
<br/>in saying that there is none equal to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>it in strangeness in the world. the 
<br/>breadth is not one but nearly two 
<br/>thousand yards and it falls sheer 
<br/>down 310 feet. The river was very 
<br/>low and we could see everything clearly
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>The whole river leaps into a crack &amp; this 
<br/>crack is prolonged in the most fantastic 
<br/>manner - the country below or East of 
<br/>the falls being quite as high as the lip over 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>which the <span class="">Zambesi</span> rolls - try if you can 
<br/>understand this scrawl. All these <span class="figure  ">{figure}</span>
<br/>promontories are of the same 
<br/>level as the bed of the river 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>above the falls and <span class="del cancelled">and</span>
<br/>over 300 feet sheer down 
<br/>has the river of a mile wide 
<br/>jammed into a crack some eighty or 
<br/>100 feet wide at the bottom. A most 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>extensive coal field extends from below 
<br/><span class="">Tette</span> to near <span class="">Victoria Falls</span>. In some places 
<br/>a steamer could load out of the seam in 
<br/>the bank of the river. These falls will 
<br/>be visited and coal worked when we are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>no longer here to write &amp; talk about them
<br/>I hail with great satisfaction the 
<br/>formation of the <span class="">Oxford</span> &amp; <span class="">Cambridge</span>
<br/>mission, and I shall count it a 
<br/>privilege to do whatever I can to aid 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the Bishop and his clergy. It was the 
<br/>best news I have heard in <span class="">Africa</span>
<br/>and most heartily do I thank Him 
<br/>who has put the good purpose into 
<br/>his servants hearts. No where do 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>people stand more in need of christianity 
<br/>and civilization than the Africans 
<br/>and if this mission is carried on 
<br/>with faith &amp; patience there is no 
<br/>doubt but good will eventually be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>done both to <span class="">Africa</span> &amp; <span class="">England</span>. 
<br/>It seems to me that we ought in all 
<br/>our plans for the good of others 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>specially remember our own home 
<br/>poor - our honest poor - This leads me 
<br/>to think of a small colony as likely to do 
<br/>immense good. Accompanied as it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>will be by this mission with the religious 
<br/>element I do not apprehend those frightful 
<br/>scenes which have occurred elsewhere 
<br/>(except <span class="">New Zealand</span>). As for the poor 
<br/>Portuguese, I must say nothing, but you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>"can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear" 
<br/></p>
<br/><p class="p ">We found the chief <span class="">Sekeletu</span> labouring 
<br/>under a skin disease believed to be leprosy 
<br/>the effect of course of witchcraft &amp; several 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>influential head men had been put to 
<br/>death for the crime. We tried to put him 
<br/>to rights during our short stay and his 
<br/>spirits revived. We found that a 
<br/>missionary party from the London 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Society had been nearly <span class="add  above">all</span> cut off by fever 
<br/>at <span class="">Linyanti</span>. I regret this extremely 
<br/>as the very time they were perishing 
<br/>we at a lower &amp; more unhealthy 
<br/>part of the river were curing the disease 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>so quickly that a patient would be 
<br/>stricken down and resume his march 
<br/>on foot a day or at most two 
<br/>after the operation of the remedy. This 
<br/>remedy I found effectual as long ago 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>as 1850 and ever since I have not lost 
<br/>a case but I forbore to puff. I could 
<br/>not be a quack and grieve now that 
<br/>the missionaries did not know it. 
<br/>We publish the composition now. Do drop 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>me a line at your leizure &amp; you will oblige</p>
<br/><p class="p ">yours affectionately <span class="">David Livingstone</span></p>
