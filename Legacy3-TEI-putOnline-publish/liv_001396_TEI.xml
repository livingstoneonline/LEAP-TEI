<lb/>being misunderstood by me - I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> blame you in the least -

<lb/><p rend="right">Tette <date when="1859-02-05">5<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> February 1859</date></p>
<lb/>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Thompson</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>I have lately received notice
<lb/>That <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> José M. Nunes</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kilimane</settlement></placeName> had
<lb/>transmitted to you through <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Bedingfeld</persName>,
<lb/>the sum of £20 together with the <w>remain
<lb break="no"/>-ing</w> portion of the goods left in his charge,
<lb/>which you agreed to receive in lieu of
<lb/>certain expenses you had incurred on
<lb/>behalf of the London Missionary Society
<lb/>I recollect appropriating to my own use
<lb/>only a blanket - a bed &amp; some shirts, so
<lb/>I hope you will realize sufficient by
<lb/>the remainder, to refund the price of the 
<lb/>preserved possessions too, which on a 
<lb/>promise of paying for them to <choice><abbr>Com<hi rend="sup">re</hi></abbr><expan cert="medium">Commander</expan></choice>
<lb/>Trotter I allowed <persName><choice><abbr>Lieut<hi rend="sup">t</hi></abbr><expan>Lieutenant</expan></choice> Peyton</persName> to
<lb/>use.</p>
<lb/><p>I had but little time to think over the
<lb/>statements you made while I was in 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName>, and part of which you were
<lb/>good enought to put on paper. You 
<lb/>considered that my financial account
<lb/>was with the Board in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> from
<lb/><date when="1852-06">June 1852</date>" Pity you did not tell me
<lb/>so; for having <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> a letter of much
<lb/>later date giving me certain financial

<lb/>You acted honourably and you have incurred the displeasure
<cb/>
<lb/>of those who followed anotehr course in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> while it confirms the
<lb/>estimate I had formed of their animus, claims my sympathy, <persName><choice><abbr>D.</abbr><expan>David</expan></choice> Livingstone</persName>
<lb/>
<lb/>information, and as I understood
<lb/>promising me more, I made the mistake
<lb/>of asking you for <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">it to serve as</add> data in order to a
<lb/>clear settlement with both "Board &amp; <w>your-
<lb break="no"/>self</w>. You refused, but sent them 
<lb/>long afterwards notwithstanding. and
<lb/>with the account exhibiting an amount
<lb/>of grumpiness on account of my
<lb/>silence, which my previous acquaintance
<lb/>with you did not lead me to expect.
<lb/>You had been obliged to borrow my
<lb/>book you told me. This made me enquire
<lb/>at the Admiralty and I found that the
<lb/>parcel had come just a day too late for
<lb/>the <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">preceding</add> mail - The tone in which the accounts
<lb/>were given induced me also to send a
<lb/>friend to make enquiry at the channel
<lb/>through which <del type="strikethrough">it</del> <add place="above">they</add> had come - The result <unclear cert="high">was</unclear>
<lb/>a statement that the goods left at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kilimane</settlement></placeName>,
<lb/>part of which I now have sent you,
<lb/>were my own property and "everything
<lb/>claimed of me by <persName>Thompson</persName> had
<lb/>been paid by the mission." I have 
<lb/>explained the silence - a document I wished
<lb/>to send to you was partly transcribed when
<lb/>a dangerous miscarriage prevented its
<lb/>completion and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> could not get
<lb/>a letter for which you had applied out
<lb/>of the hands of the worthies in <placeName><settlement type="town"><unclear cert="low">Bloomfield</unclear></settlement></placeName>
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Friends</hi> sometimes make allowances.</p>

<lb/><p>I do not wish to enter on any <w>dis-
<lb break="no"/>cussion</w>, or say one word to wound your
<lb/>feelings, but think it would be unfair
<lb/>to you to allow you to go on with the 
<lb/>impression that I "misunderstood" you.
<lb/>In various other quarters attempts were
<lb/>made to lug forward the society, and except
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="city">Leeds</settlement></placeName> where money designed for me
<lb/>personally was sent elsewhere, every such
<lb/>attempt was as abortive as you found
<lb/>your own. All you advance by way
<lb/>of covering your defeat is purely making 
<lb/>a virtue of necessity. The appeal was
<lb/>so obviously for the society alone, that
<lb/>the executive at home published it
<lb/>verbatium without however asking me
<lb/>to pay for it or defraying the expense
<lb/>of publication themselves, and as for
<lb/>the large pamphlet, "<hi rend="underline">another of the same</hi>"
<lb/>was published in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> and as it turned
<lb/>out to the private pecuniary benefit
<lb/>of men as nearly related to the society
<lb/>as yourself, and equally loud in their
<lb/>assertions of wishing to serve me &amp;
<lb/>the Mission. I was not asked to 
<lb/>defray the expense of publication -</p>
<lb/><p>I knew nothing of these matters of 
<lb/>yours <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">while</add> in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, till your account
<lb/>came so they had no influence on my
                
        

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001396_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/><add place="marginleft">non-</add>correspondence. I am sorry you put
<lb/>yourself in such a false position.
<lb/>You did not bring forward your
<lb/>claim in the usual way and to my
<lb/>astonishment you shrank from
<lb/>allowing it to be so brought before the
<lb/>committee - It seemed as if you
<lb/>then only <choice><sic>percieved</sic><corr>perceived</corr></choice> its true nature.
<lb/>Had you even placed it before me in a fair
<lb/>manner I would have paid all instantly
<lb/>but having chosen to assume a claim
<lb/>which never existed in as far as I am 
<lb/>concerned I naturally felt strong dislike
<lb/>to being made to pay for puffing myself
<lb/>I have never <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> any desire to be puffed
<lb/>even though it should be done gratuitously.</p>
<lb/><p>You need not consider the money sent
<lb/>as from me - but from the society the executive
<lb/>of which, I consider most <unclear cert="high">unrighteously</unclear>,
<lb/>refused to pay your outlay. I never
<lb/>used any of the money of the society except
<lb/>for what I considered missionary
<lb/>purposes. This I might still have used
<lb/>in the same way, but prefer its going
<lb/>to pay a society's just debt, or back to its
<lb/>funds - I hope that my remarks may not
<lb/>appear offensive - As I have already said
<lb/>I am anxious to avoid wounding your feelings
<lb/>but having enjoyed pretty large experience at
<lb/>home in society's doings <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">under the present executive</add> I thought fairest to
<lb/>state frankly that you were far from</p>
