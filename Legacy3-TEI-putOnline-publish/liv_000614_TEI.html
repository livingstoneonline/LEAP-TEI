<br/><p class="p noindent">Asking this favour at the last is like a lady's letter - the object to be found 
<br/>in the Post script. Many &amp; cordial thanks for your letters long short 
<br/>crossed &amp; 
<br/>all</p>

<br/><p class="p ">My very Dear Friends</p>
<br/><p class="p ">It is no task to write to you - I would write 
<br/>frequently indeed if I took up my pen every time I think &amp; 
<br/>talk about you But time is not allowed one for 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>all I wish to do so you must take my efforts as all 
<br/>I can give to show that I am still the same as ever 
<br/>I am at present out at our garden which by the way 
<br/>is no nearer than forty miles from our residence 
<br/>We have very little water at <span class="">Chonuane</span> &amp; cannot 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>irrigate this year. The past season has been one 
<br/>of unwonted drought even in this thirsty land 
<br/>many fountains are quite dried up and the corn 
<br/>crop of the natives is nearly an entire failure 
<br/>the scarcity of water compels us to look for corn 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>elsewhere so we sought for a fountain elsewhere 
<br/>&amp; after some	toil have made a watercourse &amp; sowed 
<br/>some English corn. Where we ploughed is all over 
<br/>marked by footsteps of the Elephant Rhinocerous 
<br/>&amp; buffalo. We have disturbed them in their pasture 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>and the lion too seems to think we have no right 
<br/>here for they have growled enough at us lately both 
<br/>by night &amp; day. - this absence from ho<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, resp: #CO; type: strikethrough; ">pe</span>me prevents 
<br/>my using the best paper I have for you. But 
<br/>you will excuse me I know. I go over on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>saturdays to see my <span class="person_ml ">wife</span> &amp; <span class="person_rl ">child</span> &amp; preach on 
<br/>sunday We depart at daylight &amp; reach the house about 
<br/>an hour after dark - this notwithstanding the 
<br/>continual <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">work</span> the whole day on oxback which 
<br/>is not a great deal quicker than a native walks 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Our child is growing - little <span class="">Robert <span class="">Moffat</span></span> if he lives 
<br/>may see you yet. this I shall never while here 
<br/>on earth. How pleasant it would be to have 
<br/>another tea with you But no - never. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span><span class="">L</span></span> has 
<br/>begun to write you several times but never 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>finished one good enough for <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span><span class="">Pyne</span></span> I 
<br/>do not wonder at this for she has very 
<br/>little time. She must attend to everything almost 
<br/>and everything has to be made from the raw 
<br/>material. She dreams about you which shews 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>her thoughts are frequently turned "youwards" 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>She manages her house very well and I have much 
<br/>cause for gratitude for comfort<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">s</span><span class="unclear">to</span> which I was 
<br/>before a stranger. She teaches some of the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Bakuenes</span>
<br/>who come for instruction sewing &amp; reading But 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>we are not yet fairly settled One of the chiefs wives 
<br/>sews beautifully after a very little instruction 
<br/>She is now making a patch work waistcoat for 
<br/>her husband Did I ever thank you for patchwork 
<br/>shawls? If not I now do. I gave one lately to a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>woman who assisted to a loaf of bread on 
<br/>an occasion when I had tasted none for 
<br/>six weeks before. You mention some box or 
<br/>boxes sent these have not yet arrived so 
<br/>I cannot speak of the contents. We sent 	£26 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to you lately &amp; told <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="">P</span></span> how to do with the sum 
<br/>Hope it came safely to hand. We are favoured 
<br/>with Indian visitors occasionally. they come to 
<br/>hunt for game &amp; health - of the former they 
<br/>find plenty and we are better off now than 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>at <span class="">Mabotsa</span> - the chief is very liberal &amp; scarcely 
<br/>a week passes without a present of meat 
<br/>being sent to us. One of our visitors this year 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="">Oswel</span></span> from <span class="">Tinneveley</span> knows <span class="">Ongar</span> well. 
<br/>He is a judge &amp; collector of customs -  shewed us 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>great kindness last year and this year brought 
<br/>two cows for <span class="">Robert</span>. We have agreed to travel 
<br/>together to the Bamapela a very powerful 
<br/>tribe of Matibele about 10 days East of us 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> L.</span> will go too. If spared we shall furnish 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>you with some account of our journey 
<br/>A <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="">Arkwright</span></span> descended from him who 
<br/>invented the spinning jenny has passed us too 
<br/>on his way northward after game - the prodigious 
<br/>herds of between 20 &amp; 30 different kinds of game 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>will probably attract more of the sporting 
<br/>than religious world here We like to see them 
<br/>it is always a novelty to us to see strangers 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="">Methuen</span></span> concerning whom I gave you 
<br/>a few particulars has we hear published an 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>account of his trip. It will be a sporting 
<br/>work I presume. If you see it let me know 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>what he says about missionaries. Our sister <span class="">Ann</span>
<br/>came to see us at <span class="">Mabotsa</span> and in returning homewards 
<br/>the people lost some sleeping skins. Two of them 
<br/>returned to seek them and took the only gun with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>them. <span class="">Ann</span> was left thus with the waggon driver 
<br/>&amp; only one servant - a female. A lion attacked the 
<br/>oxen while still daylight. She saw him kill one - 
<br/>He then cooly eat it and as the people did not return 
<br/>with the gun she lay in the waggon listening to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the impudent brute coming every now &amp; then 
<br/>to the waggon sides &amp; giving a roar as much as 
<br/>to say "Disturb me if you dare." In the morning 
<br/>as all the oxen fled back to <span class="">Mabotsa</span> Poor <span class="">Ann</span>
<br/>walked about forty miles back. the sun burned 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the skin off her face and every bush seemed 
<br/>to contain a lion - To add to the misfortune 
<br/>she found we had gone off to <span class="">Chonuane</span> - &amp; 
<br/>she could only find a few potatoes to eat 
<br/>We knew nothing of her being there and except 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>unground corn the potatoes were the only food 
<br/>she got until they brought the waggon back 
<br/>Would <span class="">Mary</span> like this to be her position? -</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We have no news here. We endeavour to 
<br/>impart saving knowledge - sometimes our 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>hopes are bright. Our hearts elated - at other 
<br/>times our sorrows are abundant and our hearts 
<br/>very sore. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="">Inglis</span></span> is snug in my house at 
<br/><span class="">Mabotsa</span>. He tried to remove the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">Bahurutse</span>

<br/>disliked him. In moving the dissafected party <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">invited</span>
<br/>the Koranas to attack the moving party. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="">I.</span></span> assisted 
<br/>his party with ammunition and about 28 of 
<br/>the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">Koranas</span> perished - they vow vengeance against

<br/>more able to commence a new station than I was 
<br/>It would be much better if missionaries would go 
<br/>forward fearlessly to the tribes beyond</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I think I mentioned that <span class="">Sechele</span> attacked the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>successor of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">Bube</span></span> &amp; dispersed the tribe. He 
<br/>by our entreaty acted a magnanimous part 
<br/>on the occasion of a portion of the people 
<br/>wishing to remove to him. But the rest believing 
<br/>that he would always be hindered by his 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>missionary from shedding blood heaped 
<br/>insults upon him <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: until">untill</span> he could bear it 
<br/>no longer and their dispersion was the result 
<br/> they beat some of his people shamefully - this was 
<br/>their last deed for <span class="">Sechele</span> keeping the object of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>his expedition a profound secret from us 
<br/>attacked &amp; killed about a dozen of what were 
<br/>the people of <span class="">Bube</span> -  the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">remained</span> fled to

<br/><span class="">Bube</span> came about ten miles along the road 
<br/>with me to <span class="">Chonuane</span>. Poor people they 
<br/>know not what they do. Will you post
