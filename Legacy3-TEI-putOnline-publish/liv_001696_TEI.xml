<lb/>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Lord Kinnaird</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/>Your most welcome 
<lb/>letter of April last came to hand by two of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Oxford</placeName> and <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> missionaries 
<lb/>who without knowing a word of the 
<lb/>language or a bit of the way came up 
<lb/>this river in common country <choice><sic>canoes</sic><corr>canoes.</corr></choice>
<lb/>This has never yet been accomplished 
<lb/>by a single Portuguese </p>
<lb/><p>From a small section of this river - 
<lb/>say six miles, to which we were limited 
<lb/>by our vessel being too deep to run up 
<lb/>and down. we bought at a very cheap 
<lb/>rate about 300 lbs of excellent clean cotton 
<lb/>It was not the period of the cotton crop 
<lb/>and had we not been employed elsewhere 
<lb/>double the quantity could easily have 
<lb/>been obtained. the people had not been 
<lb/>stimulated by the prospect of a regular 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001696_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">2/</add> market to plant more than they meant for 
<lb/>their own use, and having ourselves been 
<lb/>cheated in our supply of calico we had to 
<lb/>offer them the most worthless <unclear cert="low">hash</unclear> you 
<lb/>can <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> in payment. But calico 
<lb/>is here in very great demand. You must 
<lb/>not imagine that we are here among the 
<lb/>"Gonakeds." Every one is clothed with 
<lb/>the inner bark of a certain tree and 
<lb/>calico is so highly valued that the very 
<lb/>best slaves cost only five yards valued 
<lb/>out here at 2/6. Women and children 
<lb/>go for two yards or one shilling. You can 
<lb/>get any work done for calico. But a 
<lb/>great difficulty meets us here. 1 We 
<lb/>shew the way. 2 We open the markets 
<lb/>3 We so gain the confidence of the natives 
<lb/>that to any man of common sense 
<lb/>life and property are perfectly secure. 
<lb/>Are Government servants to become 
<lb/>besides public cotton collectors? I 
<lb/>think that after we have accomplished 
<lb/>these three important results in any one 
<lb/>part of the country there are work is 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001696_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">3/</add> done. This <placeName>lower Shire valley</placeName> <add place="above">&amp; hills adjacent</add> produce<del type="strikethrough">s</del>
<lb/>an immense quantity of cotton superior 
<lb/>to common American. Who is to collect 
<lb/>it, and after it is collected are the Portuguese 
<lb/>to be allowed to put a tax on it while 
<lb/>all Portuguese productions go out 
<lb/>free. We go onwards. We are now 
<lb/>going down to the sea expecting to meet 
<lb/>a steamer built at <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> in 
<lb/>compartments, and every man of us 
<lb/>will be employed during the best 
<lb/>part of a twelve month in 
<w>trans-<lb break="no"/>porting</w> it past <placeName>Murchison's cataracts</placeName>
<lb/>I look back therefore to see if any 
<lb/>advantage is to be taken of our 
<lb/>labours among a people now all 
<lb/>friendly - witness the passage of these 
<lb/>missionaries - and I see only the 
<lb/>Portuguese erecting a fort at the 
<lb/>mouth of the <placeName>Shire.</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>With respect to the finer kinds 
<lb/>of cotton the sea island, it really 
<lb/>flourishes in this country with very

<lb/>and upper Shire </placeName> contains a considerable 
<lb/>quantity of salt. the people even extract 
<lb/>salt for their food out of it. this may 
<lb/>be the reason why it takes so kindly 
<lb/>to the soil. But we have besides an 
<lb/>indignous cotton which shews an 
<lb/>inch and a half staple. We found it 
<lb/>below <placeName>Victoria falls</placeName> on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>and again at the upper end of <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Nyassa</placeName> With the idea of a colony 
<lb/>I throughly agree and I expect <add place="above">soon</add> to 
<lb/>meet a <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Stewart,</persName> a minister I 
<lb/>believe of the free church of Scotland 
<lb/>who has come out to consult me 
<lb/>on this very point. The object is partly 
<lb/>religious. <del type="strikethrough">and</del> with a view to influence 
<lb/>the slave trade. and I suppose to benefit 
<lb/>our honest poor. Besides cotton we could 
<lb/>grow wool on all our highlands and 
<lb/>instead of being considered intruders 
<lb/>would be looked on by the natives as 
<lb/>benefactors. </p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">5/</add><space extent="2" unit="chars"/> When we went up to the highlands East 
<lb/>of <placeName>Murchison's cataract's</placeName> to introduce the 
<lb/>bishop to the <term type="tribe">Mangangja</term> - (pronounced 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Mañ-anja.</term> g not heard) we met Portuguese 
<lb/>slave hunters returning with large numbers 
<lb/>of captives - An extensive system of slave 
<lb/>hunting had been been set agoing by instigating 
<lb/>a tribe called <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> to attack village 
<lb/>after village of <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> - kill the 
<lb/>men and sell the women &amp; children to 
<lb/>the Portuguese. All the captives met fell 
<lb/>with my hands and I presented them to 
<lb/>the bishop to begin school with. the 
<lb/>piecemeal destruction going on along 
<lb/>their borders produced no effort at 
<lb/>union for mutual defence among the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Manganja</term> - All were fleeing. So in order 
<lb/>to prevent the country around the mission 
<lb/>from becoming depopulated and to stop 
<lb/>the effusion of blood we went to try what 
<lb/>a conference would do. On approaching 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> all our declarations of peace 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001696_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">6/</add> were nullified by some <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> followers 
<lb/>trying to frighten the enemy by calling out 
<lb/>that one of their great sorcerers had come 
<lb/>Unfortunately it did not strike me that we 
<lb/>were thereby deprived of the protection of 
<lb/>our English name till afterwards - they 
<lb/>rushed at us like furies and shot at 
<lb/>us with muskets and poisoned arrows 
<lb/>at about 50 yards distance. We were obliged 
<lb/>to drive them off with our firearms - the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Manganja</term> alone suffered from the weapons 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Ajawa.</term> The bishop has since 
<lb/>gone to drive away other companies 
<lb/>of <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> who were destroying his 
<lb/>people though I thought he ought to have 
<lb/>acted only on the defensive as we did. 
<lb/>This slave hunting has depopulated large 
<lb/>tracts of as fine land as any in the world 
<lb/>And as the Portuguese encourage it - 
<lb/>the authorities keeping discreetly in the 
<lb/>background much more territory will 
<lb/>be laid waste. A colony would be a 
<lb/>defensive nucleus for fugitives from 
<lb/>the slave hunters. the bishop has 200

<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">7/</add> freed people on his station and a large 
<lb/>population is collecting around him. </p>
<lb/><p> On the <placeName>Upper shire</placeName> we found thousands 
<lb/>of fugitives. We carried a boat past the 
<lb/>cataracts and sailed up into <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName>
<lb/>We found it to be a very deep lake. 
<lb/>A ship could find ancorage only near 
<lb/>the shore. Our leadline gave no bottom at 
<lb/>210 feet in the south and in the north 
<lb/>we felt bottom with a fishing line at 600 
<lb/>feet in a bay. A mile outside we could 
<lb/>find no bottom at 696 feet. It is 
<lb/>from 20 to 50 miles broad - Over 200 
<lb/>miles long and surrounded by 
<lb/>mountains and high uplands. the 
<lb/>population is prodigiously large 
<lb/>but slavery is the only trade. An 
<lb/>Arab vessel called a <term type="boat">dhow</term> fled from 
<lb/>us full of slaves to the East shore 
<lb/>twice. We were on the West and it was 
<lb/>so stormy during the Equinoctial gales 
<lb/>(September) we could not cross in an 
<lb/>open boat. The <term type="boat">dhow</term> had lately been built 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001696_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">8/</add> and <unclear cert="low"><persName>Colonel Rigby</persName></unclear> our consul at <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>
<lb/>says in a letter published in the "Times" that 
<lb/>nearly all the slaves come from <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>the valley of the Shire and a small steamer 
<lb/>on the lake would break the neck of 
<lb/>the trade. We shall now set ourselves to 
<lb/>this work. then look for an outlet for 
<lb/>ourselves by the <placeName>Rovuma.</placeName> We could 
<lb/>obtain no accurate information about 
<lb/>it except that it was a very large river 
<lb/>In this all agreed but its distance from 
<lb/>the <placeName>Lake</placeName> varied from a few yards to 50 
<lb/>miles </p>
<lb/><p> I suppose that the Government will 
<lb/>pay for the steamer after we have put 
<lb/>it on the Lake - but do not know. 
<lb/>It was built by my friends in <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>
<lb/>and the builders "Tod &amp; Macgregor" take 
<lb/>nothing <add place="above">from me</add> until they see whether any thing 
<lb/>will be granted. The expenses of this 
<lb/>steamer <add place="above"><term type="boat">(Pioneer)</term> &amp;</add> all her crew are great £ 11,000 
<lb/>but next year they will be less. 
<lb/>The <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> is unfortunately too deep 
<lb/>A splendid strong good vessel with this

<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">9/</add> one fault. Were she on the <placeName>Lake</placeName> she 
<lb/>would be admirable. I do not grumble 
<lb/>about her I am most thankful to 
<lb/>have her, but with half her draught as 
<lb/>was intended in the plan she would 
<lb/>have gone up any of the <placeName>East African</placeName>
<lb/>rivers. </p>
<lb/><p>The kind of people that would 
<lb/>suit this country would be families 
<lb/>of the agricultural class - men that 
<lb/>could turn their hands to anything - 
<lb/>build their own huts - make their 
<lb/>own doors - tables - chairs, everything 
<lb/>They ought to form their first 
<lb/>establishment on the highlands 
<lb/>and as they became acclimatized 
<lb/>descend to lower levels. This is 
<lb/>what I have recommended for 
<lb/>the Mission, and they will in all 
<lb/>probability enjoy good health - If 
<lb/>the obstacle presented by Portuguese

<lb/>being given - (It is not withheld now 
<lb/>but the placing of posts or stations 
<lb/>everywhere on our line of entrance, 
<lb/>shews what is intended) or by our 
<lb/>finding an entrance by Rovuma 
<lb/>I would say send at once. some 
<lb/>preparation might be made but 
<lb/>a year must elapse ere we are 
<lb/>on the Lake with our steamer. 
<lb/>and then there is difficulty of the 
<lb/>Pioneer's draught. She could take 
<lb/>cargo or people up either <placeName>Shire</placeName> or 
<lb/>Rovuma during but a part of 
<lb/>the year. the benefits to be derived 
<lb/>from a small colony of industrious 
<lb/>people in stimulating the people 
<lb/>of the country to cultivate largely 
<lb/>cannot well be over-rated. I am 
<lb/>supporting that besides cultivating

<lb/><add place="above" hand="#U" rend="gray">11/</add> cotton themselves they would purchase 
<lb/>the produce of the natives with calico. 
<lb/>Beyond all doubt slave trading would 
<lb/>soon die a natural death. When 
<lb/>we entered the <placeName>Lake</placeName> on the 2<hi rend="sup underline">nd</hi> September 
<lb/>among the crowds that pressed around 
<lb/>us I said to an intelligent man 
<lb/>who had been down at the coast 
<lb/>" We come today only to see the Lake 
<lb/>but next year we shall come in a 
<lb/>ship to buy cotton and ivory. but 
<lb/>no slaves." After thinking some 
<lb/>time he addressed the crowd, going 
<lb/>over what I had said, and added 
<lb/>" I see plainly that these people will 
<lb/>enrich us. " they can see at once the 
<lb/>benefits we propose to confer but 
<lb/>the work must be done by many 
<lb/>hands, and it is encouraging to 
<lb/>remember that while benefitting 
<lb/>Africans we are bestowing a boon

<lb/>that introduction of whites would drive 
<lb/>the blacks into a corner, but when I 
<lb/>went up with him to the highlands 
<lb/>he spontaneously remarked, I see you 
<lb/>are quite right there is abundance of 
<lb/>room for all - He is high church 
<lb/>but there being no one to laugh at or oppose 
<lb/>the pretensions of that party it cannot 
<lb/>flourish out here - To be anything 
<lb/>is better than heathenism and if the

<lb/>of the people I don't care though they
