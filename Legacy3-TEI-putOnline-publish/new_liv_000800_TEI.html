<br/>
<br/>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">    </span><span class="">The Reverend Doctor Tidman</span></p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p center"><span class="space">                                                </span>My Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                                                                        </span>When the obstacles which caused our  
<br/>detention at <span class="">Kuruman</span> were removed we passed quickly towards the <span class="">country
<br/>of <span class="">Sebituane</span></span> untill within one degree of Latitude from this town. All the people
<br/>were then suddenly laid prostrate by fever, except one lad and myself. This
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>caused a further loss of time but through the goodness of God, all recovered.
<br/>On reaching this, the Southern capital of the Makololo we were <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>
<br/>with all the demonstrations of welcome which they are accustomed to
<br/>bestow on their chiefs. The idea seemed universal that with a missionary
<br/>some great indefinite good had arrived. Many expected to be elevated
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>at once to a condition equal to that of the Bakwains and inhabitants
<br/>of <span class="">Kuruman</span>, of which they had <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> very exaggerated accounts; 
<br/>others imagined that they would very soon be transformed into civilized
<br/>men, possessing the clothing, horses, arms, waggons, &amp;c. of <span class="">Europeans</span>,
<br/>"<span class="">Jesus</span> had not loved their forefathers, hence their present degradation. He
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>"had loved the white men, and given them all the wonderful things they
<br/>"now possess. And as I had come to teach them to pray to Jesus, and to
<br/>"pray for them, their means would soon be all supplied." A very
<br/>great deal was expected too from medicines and my liberality in
<br/>giving things I have <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">not</span> in my posession. Patient industry, and perseverance
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in learning were never thought of. The chief not yet nineteen years
<br/>of age, frequently pressed me to name something I wished, so that
<br/>he might by presenting it shew his affection, and I suspected,
<br/>induce me forthwith to commence the work of metamorphosis
<br/>by means of enchantments. But when I steadily refused to mention 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>any object I desired more than to secure their temporal and spiritual
<br/>welfare by means of the <span class="">gospel</span>, he seemed to test my sincerity
<br/>by presenting 4 small and 8 large elephant's tusks. I had not
<br/>an opportunity of refusing them, as they were brought and laid down
<br/>by <span class="del cancelled">my</span> <span class="add  above">the</span> waggon during my absence. And then the chief came and
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>begged me so earnestly to accept them I felt at a loss how to act.
<br/>In other circumstances, I should have felt no hesitation in appropriating
<br/>them to defray expenses incurred entirely on account of this people.  
<br/>But as it was, though I had no <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">direct</span> evidence that the chief's object was
<br/>such as I have described, the mere suspicion led me when departing
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>for the <span class="">Barotse country</span>, to request him to leave orders that if any
<br/>traders came my <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: worry">wory</span> must be used as well as his own. By
<br/>this means no offence was given which might have been the case  
<br/>had I at once sent them back. Some months were spent here.
<br/>for though I soon proposed to examine the country in order to
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>discover a suitable locality for a mission, <span class="">Sekeletu</span> objected first
<br/>that he had not yet had a satisfactory look at me. He must
<br/>see me longer. Then he could not think of allowing me to go <span class="add  below">alone</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>alone. He must accompany me and see that no evil <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: befell">befel</span> me. This required
<br/>considerable preparation, during which I offered to teach the people to read
<br/>Long and profound were the deliberations over this. They are never in
<br/>a hurry in <span class="">Africa</span>, and reading seems so supernatural; it cannot be
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>explained to those who know nothing of letters. At last the chief told
<br/>me that he was "afraid that learning to read might change his heart,
<br/>and make him content with one wife only, as in the case of <span class="">Sechele</span>" It
<br/>was in vain to urge that the altered state of mind contemplated would be
<br/>as voluntary as the present. -- So underhand means would be employed
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to convert, all the means employed being open teaching. -- There is no compulsion
<br/>The truth is taught respecting God's will and the belief or unbelief of the
<br/>instructed is left as an affair between their judge and themselves.
<br/>It was just as I have felt in my early years in contemplating that
<br/>everlasting preaching praying &amp; singing prolonged into Heaven. Quite
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>failing to realize the altered state of mind which produces a relish for
<br/>such service it seemed as if celestial joys might be endured, rather
<br/>than be consigned to the other quarter. As I was then subjected to
<br/>repeated attacks of the Fever, I did not press the subject long. But 
<br/>when we returned from the <span class="">Barotse</span>, an experiment of which I
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>have reason to be satisfied was set on foot. <span class="">Sekeletu</span>'s Father in law
<br/>and step-father were appointed to learn to read in order that their
<br/>experience may serve as a beacon to others. Though the plan exhibits
<br/>the extreme of <span class="">African</span> caution, they applied themselves so rigorously
<br/>they and several others mastered the Alphabet perfectly in one day.
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>But teaching to read being less my object in this journey than
<br/>preaching the <span class="">gospel</span> of peace while endeavoring to discover
<br/>a salubrious locality for a mission, I shall proceed to relate
<br/>our visit to the <span class="">Barotse country</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Two sketches are enclosed, one long and large or just as I put 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>it down as we went along. The other small - reduced to the Latitudes
<br/>&amp; Longitudes according <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">to</span> observations taken as opportunities occurred.
<br/>The large is sent in order that you may see several remarks,
<br/>which my pen is not fine enough to insert in the reduced scale.
<br/>and in order that if necessary a more correct reduction may be made.
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>We embarked on the river called everywhere <span class="river ">Leeambye</span> at the village
<br/>of <span class="">Sekhosi</span>. <span class="">our fleet</span> consisting of 33 canoes and <span class="">our company</span> of
<br/>about 160 men. From the bend at <span class="">Katrina-molelo</span> up to the
<br/>commencement of the <span class="">Barotse valley</span>, the country is covered by
<br/>forest and Tsetse. The country otherwise seemed well adapted for
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>a residence. Many villages of Banyeti, a poor but industrious
<br/>people are situated on both banks. They are expert as hunters
<br/>of hippopotami &amp; other animals. They cultivate grain too extensively
<br/>At the bend above named commences the rocky bottom which
<br/>forms cataracts and rapids all the way up to the <span class="">Barotse</span>. The
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>river is of very great beauty and breadth. In the Southern
<br/>confines of Latitude 16° the high banks open to leave the 
<br/>river and stretch away to the N.N.E. and N.N.W. untill between 
<br/>twenty and thirty miles apart. The intervening space is <span class="del cancelled">the</span>
<br/>the <span class="">Barotse country</span> and is annually inundated as lower

 
	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><span class="">Egypt</span> is by the <span class="">Nile</span>. The valley is covered with coarse succulent grasses
<br/>which are the pasturage of large herds of cattle during a portion of the year.
<br/>There are many villages of Makololo in the valley. I have not put down
<br/>all that I visited and many were seen in the distance. But there are
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>no large towns. The reasons are the mounds on which alone towns
<br/>and villages are built are all small. And the people require to be separate
<br/>on account of being rich in cattle. <span class="">Nariele</span> does not contain 1000
<br/>inhabitants. The ridges are thickly strewed with villages. The people
<br/>Banyeti and Barotse are not rich in cattle but they require to
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>live apart on account of cultivating large gardens of sugar cane
<br/>sweet potato, manioc, yams. millet maize &amp;c &amp;c. The exhalations
<br/>which arise from a valley 20 miles broad and about 100 long produce
<br/>Fever which is very fatal even among <span class="">natives</span>. It prevails most
<br/>virulently when the waters of inundation are retiring. We went
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>North till we came to the junction of the <span class="">Leeba</span> or <span class="">Londa</span> with the
<br/>main stream <span class="">Leeambye</span> in 14° 11' south Lat. and found the country
<br/>presenting the same characteristics as I have described. On returning
<br/>towards <span class="">Nariele</span> I went to the <span class="">Eastern ridge</span> in order to examine
<br/>that and see the establishment of a Merchant from the farthest
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>inland station of the Portuguese, opposite <span class="">Benguela</span>. A stockade had
<br/>been erected, and a flagstaff for the Portuguese banner planted. The houses
<br/>of the merchant and some bastards were in the <span class="">West African</span> style. The
<br/>owner whom I had previously seen at <span class="">Linyanti</span> was absent but his
<br/><span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">servants</span> did their utmost to shew me kindness. When my boatmen prepared my
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>bed outside, They insisted on my occupying their master's couch, and I
<br/>never felt so grateful in my life for a warm shelter for I was in the
<br/>cold stage of one of the intermittents which continue to plague me after
<br/>the Fever. I thought of going Westward in company with this merchant
<br/>but the sight of <span class="">gangs of poor wretches</span> in chains at the stockade
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>moved me resolve to proceed alone. I have not, I am sorry
<br/>to confess, discovered a healthy locality. The whole of the <span class="">country of
<br/><span class="">Sebituane</span></span> is unhealthy. The current of the river is rapid as far as
<br/>we went, and shewed we must have been on an elevated table
<br/>land. Yet the inundations cause the fever to prevail very extensively.
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>I am at a loss what to do, But will not give up the case as
<br/>hopeless. Shame upon us if we are to be outdone by <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> traders</span>.
<br/>I met <span class="">Arabs</span> from <span class="">Zanquebar</span>, subjects of the <span class="">Imanin of <span class="">Muscat</span></span>
<br/>who had been quite <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> the <span class="">continent</span>. They wrote Arabic readily 
<br/>in <span class="">my note book</span> and boldly avowed that Mahomet was the greatest
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>of all the prophets. In pursuance of a nobler object than theirs
<br/>I have determined to try and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: fulfill">fulfil</span> the second part of my enterprise
<br/><span class="add  marginleft"> [viz.] </span> open up a way to the coast. I give the <span class="">West</span> the preference because
<br/>it is nearer. If my calculations are right, the Longitudes of the
<br/>map of last year are all wrong. The waggon stand for instance instead
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>of being in 26° is 23° 48' or 50'. I have repeated the calculations
<br/>of Lunar distances again and again and always with the same result
<br/>But I do not wish this error published untill I hear from the 
<br/>Astronomer at the <span class="">Cape</span> to whom I have submitted the

 	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>observations and also some occultations by which to test them. But
<br/>for the destruction of my celestial map by the <span class="">Boers</span> I might have
<br/>determined the Longitudes by occultations alone, they being much more
<br/>to be depended on than the commmon method of Lunar distances. If then
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I am right we are nearer the <span class="">west</span> than the <span class="">East coast</span>. <span class="">Nariele</span> is on
<br/>23° East and the confluence of the <span class="">Leeba</span> or <span class="">Londa</span> not much more.
<br/>I have not had time to work out the Longitude of that point but the
<br/>river <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">(<span class="">Leeba</span>)</span> comes from the capital of a powerful state whose chief is
<br/>reported to be friendly to foreigners. If I am permitted to return by
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>this chieftain it will be water carriage for perhaps ⅔<span class="sup ">ds</span> of the way.
<br/>And should a mission be established there in time it will be all the
<br/>better - I intend to try for <span class="">Loanda</span> because though farther many
<br/>English live there. I go on horseback. Waggon travelling being reported
<br/>impossible on account of forests and numerous rivers. The Portuguese
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>are carried <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear">up</span> in hammocks hung on poles. Two <span class="">slaves</span> carry a man
<br/>It does not look well. The Portuguese maps are all constructed from
<br/><span class="">native</span> reports, so no <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: dependence">dependance</span> can be placed on them. Many tribes
<br/>inhabit the country all more or less accustomed to the visits of
<br/>strangers. The greatest difficulty I apprehend is that of making our
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>objects understood. Their languages bear a close affinity to the <span class="">Barotse</span>
<br/>dialect but this I was compelled to give up reducing.</p>
<br/>
<br/><hr class="milestone line"/>
<br/><p class="p ">I never had a touch of the Fever till my employment became
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>sedentary here. I have had eight attacks since The last when going
<br/>North of <span class="">Nariele</span> was very severe, being accompanied with large
<br/>loss of florid blood. It thinned me much. But on no occasion
<br/>did I <span class="del-by-over-text" title="Text deleted by over-writing">lay</span><span class="add  overtext" title="Addition written over existing text">{lie}</span> by. Fits of vertigo probably from exhaustion troubled
<br/>me for some time. Everything seemed to rush to the left and I had
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>to lay hold on something to prevent a fall. These induced me to give
<br/>up collecting <span class="">Barotse</span> words and other materials for a <span class="">dictionary</span>. 
<br/>Though still thin the intermittents have left, and I am only waiting for
<br/><span class="weather ">the rain to commence</span> to start for the <span class="">West</span>. They begin next month
<br/>It will be seen that <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> L.</span> had better not come to the <span class="">Cape</span> to
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>meet me at the time appointed. If I reach <span class="">Loanda</span> in <span class="">February</span>
<br/>I must return with the people again and will be here instead of
<br/>at the <span class="">Cape</span>. The time unavoidably lost by <span class="">Boers</span> and Fever
<br/>renders a little extension of my furlough necessary. Then if the
<br/><span class="">Directors</span> sanction a permanent station or any other form of
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>labour for this miserable <span class="">Interior</span>, some other mode of travelling
<br/>in from the <span class="">west</span> must be arranged. A few kind words
<br/>to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> L.</span> from you, will I think make her willing to prolong
<br/>her stay in <span class="">Scotland</span>. Although the prospect seems dark for
<br/>the <span class="">Interior</span> it may not be quite so gloomy as I have drawn
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>it The <span class="">natives</span> describe the mortality as very great and that
<br/>attacks of fever are excessively frequent &amp; severe. I have given
<br/>you their ideas. But my own except at times are not so sombre 
<br/>I tried <span class="">native</span> remedies in some of the attacks to which I was
<br/>subjected in order to discover if they had any valuable means of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>cure but After being stewed in vapour baths, and smoked <span class="del cancelled">in</span>
<br/>over fires of green plants in hot potsherds &amp;c &amp; I find that our 
<br/>own medicines are much more efficacious and safer. I have not lost

    

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>a single patient by fever. And if I had been able  regulate my diet I should
<br/>not have been subjected to so many attacks. As it was we were frequently
<br/>compelled to eat on the principle of laying in a stock for the next day. <span class="">My
<br/>own people</span> being too weak to go with me and the Makololo cook only in the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>evenings when travelling. Then if I left the canoe in order to visit a village
<br/>there are <span class="del cancelled">soo</span><span class="add  above">so</span> many branches of the river intersecting the valley everywhere
<br/>I was always wet up to the middle. I fear to give you either a too encourag<br/>-ing or discouraging report. I am afraid to incur the responsibility of
<br/>inducing you to regard the case as hopeless. The American missionaries
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>report the <span class="">Gaboan</span> station as not warranting the long established belief
<br/>that <span class="">Europeans</span> could not live there. And my firm conviction is
<br/>that even the <span class="">Interior</span> of <span class="">Africa</span> merits a fair trial. Such with the
<br/>help of God and your sanction I am determined to give it.)</p>
<br/>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><hr class="milestone line"/>
<br/><p class="p ">The <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> was prohibited here, and a large <span class="">party of Mambari</span>
<br/>who were here endeavoring in vain to renew it, fled precipitately as
<br/>soon as they heard that I had crossed the <span class="">Chobe</span>. The Makololo remon-
<br/>strated with them but they asserted that I would take all their
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>goods from them because they dealt in <span class="">slaves</span>. A Portuguese
<br/>came from the <span class="">West</span> but he finding no market remained only
<br/>three days and returned. It was different in the <span class="">Barotse</span> or
<br/><span class="">Northern division</span> of the country. Another Portuguese merchant
<br/>came thither and by means of an underchief who had some
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>pretensions to the <span class="">chieftainship</span> obtained free access to all the 
<br/>Banyeti, Batoka and Bashukulorupo villages East of the
<br/><span class="river ">Leeambye</span>. <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">There</span> the stockade which gave great offence to the 
<br/>Makololo was erected without the knowledge or permission
<br/>of the chief. They would have commenced hostilities at
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>once in order to drive the whole <span class=""><span class="">slave</span>trading party</span> out of
<br/>the country but a variety of considerations induced me to
<br/>intercede for them and by that intercession they will be allowed
<br/>to depart in peace. Probably <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: deceived">decieved</span> by the assurances
<br/>of the disaffected underchief they seem to have had no idea
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of the risk they were running. But when the conspirator
<br/>came down with the intention of cutting off <span class="">Sekeletu</span>, He was
<br/>instantly seized and killed. His fathers and several others 
<br/>were cut off in the most cold blooded manner. And when I remon
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: strated">stated</span> against the shedding of human blood, the counsellors
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>quietly remarked, "You see we are still <span class="">Boers</span>, we are not
<br/>yet taught" But for this unfortunate affair no trading
<br/>in <span class="">slaves</span> would have been allowed. In this they have the precedent
<br/>of the former chief of the Barotse who refused to grant the
<br/>Mambari permission to visit his country as <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> traders</span>

<br/>A cannon of small calibre was found in the possession underchief
<br/>mentioned</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The country in the direction of <span class="">Mosioatunya</span> has high mountains
<br/>and the <span class="">Batoka country</span> is a high table land without trees except along
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the rivers. Healthy spots might be found in both of these but
<br/>in neither did I feel it duty to travel because the vicinity of
<br/><span class="">Mosilikatse</span> renders it impossible for Makololo or any other tribe 
<br/>to reside there. A change may yet be effected among the Matibele
<br/>which would change the present aspect of affairs</p>
