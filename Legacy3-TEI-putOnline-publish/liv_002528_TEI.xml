<lb/><p rend="center"><space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>Near <placeName>Lake Bangweolo</placeName> 8 July 1868</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Friends</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The enclosed copy of my letter 
<lb/>to <persName>Lord Clarendon</persName> will explain itself shewing 
<lb/>that unless I adopted the expedient of lending 
<lb/>you my copy I could not give you the 
<lb/>information I desired. I have no more 
<lb/>paper &amp; borrowed till I was ashamed. This 
<lb/>is a leaf out of a notebook. I have mentioned 
<lb/>your names I hope not unwisely. It was 
<lb/>impossible to bear longer with <persName>Arrowsmith</persName>
<lb/>after <persName>Galton</persName> &amp; he wrote "<hi rend="underline">Instructions</hi>" for me 
<lb/>and demanded all my private notes - 
<lb/>"copies if not the originals." - because they 
<lb/>"had voted the large sum of £500." I was to 
<lb/>"make a survey entering it in successive 
<lb/>pages of my journal" "take Latitudes 
<lb/>every night" and "ascertain the hydrography 
<lb/>of the Interior". This big word to others 
<lb/>means the survey of coasts &amp; inland waters 
<lb/>having a navigable communication with 
<lb/>the ocean. To the busy bodies of the council 
<lb/>it means <hi rend="underline">rainfall</hi>. I was 40 days at 
<lb/><placeName>Cazembe's</placeName> &amp; only got the Latitude by awaking 
<lb/>one morning between two &amp; three &amp; found a 
<lb/>star in the North - I had the evening before sat 
<lb/>in the shivering dew till I got Achernar - I 
<lb/>was set right on the spot poor <persName>Lacerda</persName> died 
<lb/>and never saw a star. For months together 
<lb/>we never saw a star - rarely did we see the 
<lb/>moon till past the first quarter. I thought 
<lb/>that I had mentioned the cloudiness of the 
<lb/>weather &amp; dense forest in my first volume 
<lb/>but the "Instructions" shew beastly ignorance<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I put them in my pocket and followed the 
<lb/>late <persName>Sir Francis Beaufort's</persName> advice to the 
<lb/>Arctic explorers "Gentlemen remember 
<lb/>that you are going for discovery and not 
<lb/>for survey" that is never measure 
<lb/>if you can explore. My private notes 
<lb/>are demanded in order that the busy 
<lb/>bodies who lounge about the Rooms 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002528_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>in White Hall Gardens may pry into them 
<lb/>and <persName>Arrowsmith</persName> get bearings or distances 
<lb/>or anything else to reduce Astronomical 
<lb/>positions to the level of his own fancyography<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I sent him the two volumes of observations 
<lb/>from the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. <choice><reg>H</reg><orig>h</orig></choice>e could make nothing 
<lb/>of them, so if can help it neither observation 
<lb/>nor sketch nor note shall go to the Geographical 
<lb/>till after publication. Fancy <persName>Baines</persName> is one 
<lb/>of the loungers a fellow who <unclear cert="low">three</unclear> several 
<lb/>times confessed to me that he had given 
<lb/>away the Government stores and he 
<lb/>would pay for them - only let him stop 
<lb/>with the Expedition without any salary! 
<lb/>He made the same confession to my brother 
<lb/>&amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rae</persName> &amp; <persName>Major Sicard</persName> acknowledged to 
<lb/>me that he had been a recipient. I kept 
<lb/>him still till he got a hold of the store book 
<lb/>and forged entries of issue of twelve months 
<lb/>provisions for six <del type="cancelled"><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="deletion"/></del> persons 
<lb/>in three months to three persons. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his 
<lb/>was such a barefaced impudent forgery 
<lb/>after his three confessions to myself 
<lb/>that I could bear no longer with him 
<lb/>I took him before all the members &amp; tried 
<lb/>his forgeries by the men themselves. Did 
<lb/>you consume one &amp; three quarter pounds 
<lb/>loaf sugar per day - they laughed &amp; the idea 
<lb/>&amp; <persName>Baines</persName> still held on to it that his issues 
<lb/>were correct. They were not in the book 
<lb/>when I examined it at <placeName>Tette</placeName>. O he had 
<lb/>them in a note book. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he story that I was 
<lb/>led my brother took among geographers 
<lb/>as it did at the <placeName>Cape</placeName>. I must really 
<lb/>appear to others to be a very soft easily 
<lb/>led no character fellow. It is a wonder 
<lb/>that I was fixed on to do this work on 
<lb/>being fixed on that I did anything. I 
<lb/>am sorry to offend <persName>Sir Roderick</persName> but 
<lb/>I bore with the <unclear cert="medium">desecration</unclear> of my 
<lb/>positions till it was intolerable. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>Cape Papers believing from <persName>Baines</persName>
<lb/>that I was soft tried their utmost 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002528_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>got vituperation and elicited nothing more 
<lb/>from me than if the worthy Editors had 
<lb/>gone about <placeName>Cape Town</placeName> blowing Penny 
<lb/>trumpets.</p>
<lb/><p>I have many observations copied out 
<lb/>for <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Mann</persName> but all at a distance: I will 
<lb/>send them from <placeName>Ujiji</placeName> with a sketch map.  
<lb/>I give no sketch map to the Geographical 
<lb/>because it was from these confessedly 
<lb/>imperfect positions that <persName>Arrowsmith<reg>'</reg>s</persName>
<lb/>chief batteries were supplied. I think that 
<lb/>he has no idea of the correction to be applied 
<lb/>to <persName>Commodore Owen<reg>'</reg>s</persName> survey because 
<lb/>I thought that my single &amp; the only 
<w>inde-<lb break="no"/>pendent</w> Longitude at <placeName>Pearl Island</placeName> added 
<lb/>the 5′ of <persName>Commodore Owen's</persName> error. 
<lb/><persName>Sir Bartle Frere</persName> told me that <persName>Arrowsmith</persName>
<lb/>wrote to him that "I made the continent 
<lb/>broader than it is". I think but have 
<lb/>no map to consult that <persName>Commodore 
<lb/>Owen</persName> made it 36º 7′ and I 36º 12′<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>A note on the back of all the charts says 
<lb/>add 5′ 9″ to correct the error of the survey 
<lb/>and thus if I am not mistaken my 
<lb/>Longitude calculated by you did.</p>
<lb/><p>In the letter sent to <persName>Lord Clarendon</persName> I 
<lb/>add that four rivers flow into <placeName>Liemba</placeName> - one 
<lb/>of these has eleven burns to form it, a fifth 
<lb/>must be added as one line of drainage 
<lb/><placeName>Chambeze</placeName><choice><sic>recieves</sic><corr>receives</corr></choice> 4 burns as large as the 
<lb/><placeName>Isis</placeName> at <placeName>Oxford</placeName> or <placeName>Avon</placeName> at <placeName>Hamilton</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It then enters <placeName>Bangweolo</placeName> to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> 2 
<lb/>good sized streams - then  as <placeName>Luapula</placeName>
<lb/>it goes into <placeName><unclear cert="low">Moero</unclear></placeName> and <choice><sic>recieves</sic><corr>receives</corr></choice> five 
<lb/>streams of which one is 80 yards broad 
<lb/>and always requires canoes. Then as 
<lb/><placeName>Lualalea</placeName> it <choice><sic>recieves</sic><corr>receives</corr></choice> two rivers and 
<lb/>is itself taken up by the <placeName>Lufira</placeName> a large 
<lb/>river which by five streams drains 
<lb/>the Western side of the valley - these three 
<lb/>lines of drainage <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> the sources 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>. Now suppose I am 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002528_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>mistaken in one or two which I did not 
<lb/>see or in two streams running into one we 
<lb/>have still some twenty sources from 30 to 
<lb/>50 yards wide - I do not count a multitude 
<lb/>of burns from five to fifteen yards wide 
<lb/>and perennial. I also add a few words 
<lb/>about a large tribe of troglodites in <placeName>Rua</placeName>
<lb/>where burrows in the rocks extend in 
<lb/>one place 30 miles with a stream of water 
<lb/>running along it. If you think proper 
<lb/>you may give a little of the information 
<lb/>to the Cape folks but I don<reg>'</reg>t like them now 
<lb/>no sooner is my back turned than I am 
<lb/>a sabbath breaker - a tyrant everything 
<lb/>that is bad. <choice><reg>C</reg><orig>c</orig></choice>ouldn<reg>'</reg>t they help poor <persName>Baines</persName>
<lb/>up to the <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName> without obliging him 
<lb/>to tell lies to excite their sympathy. If 
<lb/>anything is published <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat</persName> will see 
<lb/>it. I cannot write to him.</p>
<lb/><p>I wrote you from near <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Liemba</placeName> - the <term type="ailment">fever</term> without medicine 
<lb/>produced serious symptoms. I am 
<lb/>thankful to say that since then I have 
<lb/>had pretty good health on this highland<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>After looking a little while at this Lake 
<lb/>I go North for <placeName>Ujiji</placeName> - the islands here 
<lb/>are very large. I shall not attempt to 
<lb/>follow any river in canoes. We 
<lb/>did this on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. It was insanity 
<lb/>four times our lives were in  imminent 
<lb/>danger. I shall not be guilty of this 
<lb/>madness again especially as here 
<lb/>we have none of those good fellows 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>. I have only one chronometer 
<lb/>going  - one stopped at <placeName>Mandapala</placeName> - 3 
<lb/>changed their rates entirely by an earthquake 
<lb/>and one stopped altogether after it. I 
<lb/>could <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> no other cause. Love 
<lb/>to all at the observatory from Yours</p>
