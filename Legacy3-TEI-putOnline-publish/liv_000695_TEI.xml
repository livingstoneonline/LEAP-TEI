<lb/>imitating <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Pyne</expan></choice></persName> after she got my scolding. I was quite proud 
<lb/>when I found it had some effect and wish <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>P</abbr><expan>Pyne</expan></choice></persName> would touch 
<lb/>up my better half occasionally too. We could work to each

<lb/>and are busy <del type="strikethrough">now</del> preparing - If she will excuse me I shall 
<lb/>write during the journey and send it off as soon as we return 
<lb/>the box about which you advised us came to hand two

<lb/>for them with the kindness of a mother - It is impossible to 
<lb/>specify the different articles - they are so numerous. I was 
<lb/>nearly out of shirts and did not know what to do for the journey 
<lb/>for last time I went every washing wearing one or two of 
<lb/>my stock through the middle. <choice><sic>half</sic><corr>Half</corr></choice> a dozen from my mother in

<lb/>for putting up in tins. If you try again it may be well

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">We had a pleasant visit from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Freeman</persName> - he came a 
<lb/>few days before <choice><abbr>49</abbr><expan>1849</expan></choice> fled &amp; left a few days after <choice><abbr>50</abbr><expan>1850</expan></choice> began - We 
<lb/>outlandish people forgot to wish him a happy new year - We 
<lb/>have no holidays, but I thought we might have so planned 
<lb/>a trip of about a <choice><sic>days</sic><corr>day's</corr></choice> journey to a cave - <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> 
<lb/>would not go near it. <choice><sic>they</sic><corr>They</corr></choice> have a tradition that some people 
<lb/>went in &amp; never came out - One called <persName>Kobokoe</persName> went in 
<lb/>and was never seen again . <choice><sic>flocks</sic><corr>Flocks</corr></choice> of <term type="animal">sheep</term> were <w>some-
<lb break="no"/>times</w> <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>seen <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>near its mouth but when one went near they ran 
<lb/>in. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>The old people thought I should never return and <persName>Sechele</persName> said 
<lb/>he would go in if I did - <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>We took a lantern, a line, &amp; ladder
<lb/>It is on the face of a hill about 600 feet <w>high<del type="cancelled">t</del></w>. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>The</corr></choice> waggon with 
<lb/>wife &amp; children stood at the bottom and the firm believers in old tales 
<lb/>looked at us <add place="above">ascending</add> with awe. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I thought it might be a mile in length but 
<lb/>alas it was not 20 yards deep.- <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>We went in &amp; spoke to those 
<lb/>who had the <unclear cert="low">hardihood</unclear> to follow ( some boys were among the numbers<supplied>)</supplied>
<lb/>on the follies of the old system, and that all their other tales were 
<lb/>equally absurd. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>It seems to have been a fountain of water 
<lb/>in ancient times - <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>I crept to the extremity &amp; deposited a <unclear cert="low">Father 
<lb/>Mathew</unclear> &amp; token and a bullet, and when the old men denied 
<lb/>that we had entered we replied go to the end of it and you <w>wil<supplied cert="high">l</supplied></w> 
<lb/>find these. O, that they were wise. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>We went from thence 
<lb/>about two miles &amp; visited the spot where with <persName>Bube</persName> I led 
<lb/>out the stream. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/><choice><sic>there</sic><corr>There</corr></choice> lay the stones we had lifted up &amp; 
<lb/>the serpentine form of the watercourse was still easily <w>trace<supplied cert="high">d</supplied></w> 
<lb/>but no gurgling - stream ran by, <seg type="weather">the drought has dried up all 
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="stream"><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> streams</geogName></placeName></seg>. After spending a day among these 
<lb/>scenes we returned much pleased with our trip. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>The 
<lb/>children having had the <term type="ailment">hooping cough</term> was the thing that <w>prompt<supplied cert="high">ed</supplied></w> 
<lb/>me to this excursion. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I forgot to say that all have not been 
<lb/>so superstitious for some one had cut down a tree at the door

<lb/>which were now young trees <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> that he must have

<lb/>wish us a happy &amp;c - <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>He was much pleased with <persName>Sechele</persName> &amp; 
<lb/>wishes him to go to <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>I had no idea that he would care 
<lb/>about curiosities or I should have had some collected together 
<lb/>the great difficulty of transmitting anything to <placeName><region>the coast</region></placeName> deters me 
<lb/>from collecting . He got a few horns of animals &amp;c here - left 
<lb/>me a fine prospect glass &amp; some hooks. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>His visit was very 
<lb/>agreeable indeed. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>He had an apparatus for the Daguerrotype 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>and tried hard to take me but something in our water <w>prevente<supplied>d</supplied></w>
<lb/>Had you seen it you would perhaps have thought me rather 
<lb/>unclerical with <choice><sic>mostachios</sic><corr>mustachios</corr></choice> if that is the way to spell it
<lb/>I am becoming loyal now like <persName><term type="occupation">Prince</term> Albert</persName> but this is to prevent 
<lb/>my lips being burned by the sun. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>We were sorry the visit 
<lb/>was so short, and our accommodation is so poor.
<lb/>The object of the deputation was to reduce the expenditure from <add place="above">£</add> 9000
<lb/>to £4000. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/><choice><sic>some</sic><corr>Some</corr></choice> think this ought to be effected by allowing the 
<lb/>members of the old colonial stations to support the <bibl>gospel</bibl> among 
<lb/>themselves - others that if we let the <term type="tribe">Hottentots</term> alone they would 
<lb/>sink into their former state - We are the only society which does 
<lb/>attend to the wants of the coloured population the <orgName><orgName>Wesleyan</orgName> &amp; 
<lb/><term type="nationality">Dutch</term> reformed</orgName> attend exclusively to the <orgName>whites</orgName> <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>Now these worthy 
<lb/>men excuse themselves from attending to the <orgName>blacks</orgName> because we 
<lb/>do. "It would be unbrotherly to try &amp; take them out of our hands" 
<lb/>the thing goes round in a circle, <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>then the <term type="tribe">Hottentots</term> being <w>provid<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>ed</w> with the <bibl>gospel</bibl> free of expense, are not likely to act as free 
<lb/>independent <term type="faith">Christian</term> men. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/><choice><sic>they</sic><corr>They</corr></choice> are in tutelage perpetually 
<lb/>and the society is a sort of go cart to them - this would be 
<lb/>little if they were not unconsciously the barrier which 
<lb/>prevents the flow of the stream of benevolence to the 
<lb/>real <orgName>heathen</orgName> lands. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>F.</abbr><expan>Freeman</expan></choice></persName> has taken up <persName>D<hi rend="sup"/>r <choice><sic>Philips</sic><corr>Philips'</corr></choice></persName>
<lb/>idea that the colonial stations must be kept up for ever 
<lb/>and aye, and though we expected much from his visit 
<lb/>it is not likely to be of much service in as far as an 
<lb/>onward movement is concerned - He was much pleased 
<lb/>with the prospect beyond us and said it ought to be kept 
<lb/>open for our society. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>We are now going in a weary

<lb/>more will come away disappointed than joyous - <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>3 <term type="nationality">English</term>

<lb/>published a <bibl>book</bibl> on the latter. They were accompanied part 
<lb/>of the way by a gentleman called <persName>Nichols</persName> who came out from 
<lb/><placeName><country>England</country></placeName> to "discover the Lake" but before he had travelled many 
<lb/>days. He said why this is terrible. One <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> get anything to eat 
<lb/>I shall return to my wife. He brought the young traveller all

<lb/>they have gone off in high glee but they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know the weary
