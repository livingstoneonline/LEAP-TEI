<lb/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>On treating myself to a 
<lb/>reperusal of your kind notes I find that 
<lb/>I have to give you some information 
<lb/>about the country south of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Speaking in a general way all the region 
<lb/>south of <placeName>Tette</placeName><placeName>Senna</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> is under 
<lb/>true caffre or Zulu rule. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he paramount 
<lb/>chief <persName>Manikuse</persName>, lately deceased, lived 
<lb/>somewhere inland from <placeName>Sofala</placeName> and 
<lb/>he had war with the people of that fort 
<lb/>lately. These caffres named Landeens 
<lb/>by the Portuguese are quite friendly to 
<lb/>the English - we meet them occasionally 
<lb/>at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> where they come to 
<lb/>take tribute of the Portuguese whom 
<lb/>they conquered. We had thoughts of 
<lb/>going in that direction and to visit 
<lb/>an <add place="above">ancient</add> Jesuit establishment at <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName>
<lb/>about 60 miles west of <placeName>Senna</placeName>, but 
<lb/>we have the difficulty that the Portuguese 
<lb/>still claim the whole country, and 
<lb/>any thing we should do would be 
<lb/>opening the country which at present 
<lb/>they dare not enter, for their advantage: 
<lb/>Large sections of a very fine mountainous 
<lb/>country called <placeName>Shiringoma</placeName> were ceded 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001598_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>by the natives to Portuguese who had 
<lb/>intermarried with their chiefs - they were 
<lb/>expelled by the Zulus aforementioned, 
<lb/>and now that they dare not set a 
<lb/>foot in it their home Government 
<lb/>made a decree that the lands were to be 
<lb/><choice><sic>be</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> more equally divided, and the family 
<lb/>that got it by intermarriage should 
<lb/>only have seven leagues of it - they 
<lb/>fled lately from <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> even 
<lb/>because the rent was excessive, 
<lb/>400 dollars to their own Government, 
<lb/>&amp; 600 to the Zulus.</p>
<lb/><p>Then whenever we go the Portuguese 
<lb/>try to pick up information in a 
<lb/>sneaking way, and assert that they 
<lb/>knew all about it long ago. "It is 
<lb/>all in our archives in Lisbon"<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is not the low characters out here 
<lb/>that do so but Portuguese ministers 
<lb/>even, as in the case of two slaves 
<lb/>having come from <placeName>Cassange</placeName>
<lb/>in Angola to <placeName>Tette</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey said in 
<lb/>a dispatch to our Government that 
<lb/>these were Portuguese who "went to 
<lb/>Mosambique." <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is an old woman 
<lb/>still living at <placeName>Tette</placeName> who remembers 
<lb/>their coming, and she is positive that 
<lb/>they were quite black, and did not

<lb/>go further than <placeName>Tette</placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>They claim <placeName>Delgoa Bay</placeName> too and all 
<lb/>the sea board - so we should procure no 
<lb/>advantage for our own country by 
<lb/>opening up friendly relations with 
<lb/>the tribes inland of their claims. We 
<lb/>feel more interest in parts beyond 
<lb/>their claims - and the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> is 
<lb/>said to be navigated in large 
<lb/>canoes as far at least as the 
<lb/>Longitude of the <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="1" unit="words"/>Between <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> and 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Banyai</term> there is a large 
<lb/>friendly tribe called <term type="tribe">Bazizulus</term>
<lb/>(Portuguese Mosusurus) they have 
<lb/>cattle and are in an interesting gold 
<lb/>country - stone walls &amp; <unclear cert="low">caves</unclear>
<lb/>are said to be common. We 
<lb/>shall make a trip to them in our 
<lb/>way up after we have been to the

<lb/><p>Many thanks for the ale &amp; 
<lb/>books. We have a good chronometer 
<lb/>belonging to the Government and

<lb/>We have a third but it is small

<lb/><p>A Note on Fever for <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> MacWilliam</persName>
<lb/>transmitted by favour of <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>In the typical cases given 
<lb/>in <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> MacWilliam's</persName> Medical History of 
<lb/>the Great Niger Expedition the gall bladder 
<lb/>was found distended with black bile, 
<lb/>and if my memory does not <choice><sic>decieve</sic><corr>deceive</corr></choice>
<lb/>me most of the cases treated with quinine 
<lb/>at an early period of the disease either 
<lb/>recovered or were subjected to the 
<lb/>milder or intermittent form of Fever.</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">In 1850 I adopted the plan of giving 
<lb/>quinine mixed with a purgative as 
<lb/>the first step of the treatment - and was 
<lb/>successful in the cases of two of my 
<lb/>own children and an English party whom 
<lb/>we found at <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName>, and of whom 
<lb/>one had died before our arrival - I have 
<lb/>lost the notes of my reasons for 
<lb/>adopting the practice, but I have been 
<lb/>successful in every case I have met 
<lb/>with since. The prescription employed 
<lb/>is of Resin of Jalap and Calomel <add place="above">of each</add> eight 
<lb/>grains - Quinine and <del type="strikethrough">and</del> Rhubarb 
<lb/>of each four grains. Mix well together 
<lb/>and when required make into pills 
<lb/>with Spirit of Cardamoms. Dose from 
<lb/>Ten to Twenty grains. The violent 
<lb/>headache - pains in the back &amp;c &amp;c are all 
<lb/>relieved in from four to six hours </p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">the greatest difference to <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> MacWilliam</persName> observed was I believe 16º generally it was 6º or 7º </p><anchor xml:id="p.3v-01"/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">and with the operation of the medicine there is 
<lb/>an enormous discharge of black bile - the 
<lb/>patient frequently calls it blood. If the operation 
<lb/>is delayed a dessert spoonful of salts promotes 
<lb/>the action. Quinine is then given till the 
<lb/>ears ring &amp;c. We have tried to substitute 
<lb/>other purgatives instead of the Resin of Jalap 
<lb/>and Calomel but our experiments have 
<lb/>only produced the conviction that aught else 
<lb/>is mere trifling. No strength is lost. 
<lb/>In our march up the river of 600 miles 
<lb/>on foot - a European would be stricken 
<lb/>down one day and the next after the 
<lb/>operation of the remedy would resume 
<lb/>his march on foot. In some very 
<lb/>severe attacks a donkey was used but 
<lb/>never more than two days - he would 
<lb/>prefer to tramp it.</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="1" unit="words"/>We tried Warburg's Tincture 
<lb/>which has a great reputation in 
<lb/>India, but it causes profuse sweating 
<lb/>and does not cure the disease - 
<lb/>the strength is also impaired. We 
<lb/>had a good supply, by the kindness 
<lb/>of one of our Nobility, but I am 
<lb/>compelled to say that it did not 
<lb/>answer our expectations. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he daily 
<lb/>use of Quinine is no preventative 
<lb/>we have seen many cases occur 
<lb/>when the person was on the verge of 
<lb/>cinchonism.</p>

<lb/><p>I employed the foregoing remedy with success 
<lb/>on the west coast, but made no fuss about 
<lb/>it more than make a general statement 
<lb/>in the "Missionary Travels." I was not quite 
<lb/>sure that our fever was identical with 
<lb/>that <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> MacWilliam</persName> encountered in the 
<lb/><placeName>Niger</placeName> but the melancholy fate of a party 
<lb/>of missionaries at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> where six 
<lb/>out of nine Europeans, and four native 
<lb/>attendants perished in the short space of three 
<lb/>months makes me fear that it is the same 
<lb/>complaint as that which destroyed the officers 
<lb/>of <persName>Commodore Owen</persName> in <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> - those 
<lb/>of <persName>Captain Tuckey</persName> in the <placeName>Congo</placeName>, and the 
<lb/>crews of the Great Niger Expedition in 
<lb/>that River. My companions, <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> C. Livingstone</persName> entertain the same 
<lb/>opinion of the value of our Pills that I do. 
<lb/>We wrote a paper for one of the medical 
<lb/>journals. But the above sad case 
<lb/>makes us anxious that the remedy 
<lb/>should become more extensively known 
<lb/>than it has been - and I do not know 
<lb/>a better plan for effecting this than 
<lb/>by communicating it to <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> MacWilliam</persName>. 
<lb/>No secret has ever been made of it 
<lb/>but I felt as if saying more than 
<lb/>I did would be <hi rend="underline">Quackish</hi> - those 
<lb/>who may try it will do well to 
<lb/>remember that the above doses are 
<lb/>for great He creatures whom <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="deletion"/> <add place="above">they</add> turn 
<lb/>so effectually inside out that 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001598_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>we have termed them "Rousers". </p>
<lb/><p>I cured myself and native companions 
<lb/>in this way during my long journeys between 
<lb/>1852 and 1856 and that the remedy has 
<lb/>no bad effect on the system may be 
<lb/>inferred from the fact that I have had 
<lb/>no regular attack of fever since my 
<lb/>return. I have had little illnesses 
<lb/>probably from exposure to malaria 
<lb/>in its most intense forms, but nothing 
<lb/>like what I formerly experienced. And 
<lb/>I am of the opinion that, what we were 
<lb/>all taught, not to give quinine 
<lb/>till we had used the preliminary measure 
<lb/>of relieving the bowels, was a 
<lb/>mistake<reg>.</reg> Query. Might the <add place="above">remedy</add> not be applied 
<lb/>to some of the fevers at home that 
<lb/>arise in unhealthy localities. Around 
<lb/>every village in this country, there is 
<lb/>a very large collection of human ordure 
<lb/>during the dry season - this is swept 
<lb/>into the rivers by the heavy rains &amp; you 
<lb/>may guess the effect from hundreds of 
<lb/>Thousands of villages. The natives here 
<lb/>don<reg>'</reg>t drink it, as the natives do on the 
<lb/>banks of the Thames, but make holes in 
<lb/>the sand to draw from. Possibly this 
<lb/>has as much to do with the origin of fever as 
<lb/>it has at home. - <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>David Livingstone</p>
