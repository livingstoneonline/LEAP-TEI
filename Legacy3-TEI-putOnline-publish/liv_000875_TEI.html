<br/>ten slaughter cattle and three of the best riding 
<br/>oxen he could purchase among his people, 
<br/>together with supplies of meal and everything 
<br/>else he could think of for my comfort 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>during the journey. Hoes and beads were 
<br/>also supplied to purchase a canoe, when 
<br/>we should come to the <span class="">Zambesi</span> again, 
<br/>beyond the part where it is constricted by 
<br/>the rocks. these acts of kindness were 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>probably in part prompted by the principal 
<br/>men of the tribe, and are valuable as shewing 
<br/>the light in which our efforts are viewed. 
<br/>But as little acts often shew character more 
<br/>clearly than great ones, I may mention 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>that - having been obliged to separate from 
<br/>the people, who had our luggage, and to 
<br/>traverse about 20 miles infested by the 
<br/>Tsetsé during the night, - it became so 
<br/>pitchy dark, we could only see by the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>frequent gleams of lightning which at times 
<br/>revealed the attendants wandering hither 
<br/>and thither in the forest. The horses trembled 
<br/>and groaned, and after being thoroughly 
<br/>drenched by heavy rain we were obliged 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>to give up the attempt to go farther and crawled 
<br/>under a tree for shelter. After the excessive 
<br/>heat of the day, one is peculiarly sensitive 
<br/>to cold at night. the chief's blanket had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>fortunately not gone on. He covered me

<br/><span class="add  inline">that</span>I fear to <span class="del-by-over-text" title="Text deleted by over-writing">name a sum</span> <span class="add  above">to estimate its breadth</span>. I once shewed

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><span class="fw pageno " title=""><span class="underline ">2 Sheet</span></span>
<br/>cannot imagine the glorious loveliness of the scene 
<br/>from anything in England. The "Falls" if we may 
<br/>so term a river leaping into a sort of strait jacket 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>are bounded on three sides by forest-covered ridges 
<br/>about 400 feet in height. <span class="del-by-over-text" title="Text deleted by over-writing">(It is a pity there are no

<br/>dotted over the river above <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">the falls,</span> and both banks 
<br/>and islands are adorned with sylvan vegetation 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of great variety of colour and form. At the 
<br/>period of our visit many of the trees were spangled 
<br/>over with blossoms, and towering above them 
<br/>all stands the great burly baobab each of 
<br/>whose (syenite coloured) arms would form
