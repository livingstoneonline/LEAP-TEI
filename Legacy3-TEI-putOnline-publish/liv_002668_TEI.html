<br/>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear <span class="">Sir Bartle</span>
<br/><span class="space">                        </span>When I wrote to 
<br/>you to in February 1867, I had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the impression that I was 
<br/>then on the watershed 
<br/>between the <span class="">Zambesi</span> &amp; either 
<br/>the <span class="">Congo</span> or <span class="del cancelled">the</span><span class="">Nile</span>. Further 
<br/>observation now leads me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to believe that impression to 
<br/>have been correct, &amp; from 
<br/>what I have myself seen, 
<br/>together with what I have 
<br/>heard from intelligent 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>natives - I think that I can 
<br/>safely assert that the chief 
<br/>sources of the <span class="">Nile</span> rise between 
<br/>10° and 12° South Latitude: 
<br/>or nearly in the position 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>assigned to them by <span class="">Ptolomy</span>
<br/>whose river <span class="">Bhapta</span> is 
<br/>probably the <span class="">Rovuma</span>. I 
<br/>cannot yet speak positively 
<br/>of the parts West &amp; N.N. West 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of <span class="">Tanganyika</span> because 
<br/>these have not yet come 
<br/>under my observation 
<br/>but if you will read the 
<br/>following short sketch of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>what I have seen you 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>will</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>will see that the springs 
<br/>of the <span class="">Nile</span> have hitherto 
<br/>been sought for very much 
<br/>too far to the North. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">Leaving the valley of the 
<br/><span class="">Loangwa</span> at 12° South we climbed 
<br/>up what seemed to be a great 
<br/>map of mountains, but it 
<br/>turned out to be the southern 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>edge of an elevated region 
<br/>the height of which is from 
<br/>4000 to 6000 feet above the 
<br/>level of the sea - this upland 
<br/>may be roughly said to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>cover a space south of <span class="">Lake 
<br/>Tanganyika</span> of some 350 
<br/>miles square - It is generally 
<br/>covered with dense forest - 
<br/>has an undulating surface - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a rich soil - is well watered 
<br/>with numerous rivulets, &amp; 
<br/>for <span class="">Africa</span> is cold. It slopes 
<br/>towards the North &amp; West but 
<br/>I have not seen any part 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of it under 3000 feet of 
<br/>altitude - The country of 
<br/><span class="">Usango</span> situated East of 
<br/>the space indicated is 
<br/>also an upland and affords 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>pasturage for the immense 
<br/>herds of the cattle of the Basango
<br/>(Wasango of the Arabs) a 
<br/>very light coloured race very 
<br/>friendly with strangers. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="">Usango</span> forms one the eastern 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>side</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>side of the southern end of 
<br/>a great but still elevated 
<br/>valley. The other or Western 
<br/>side is formed by what are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>called the Kone mountains 
<br/>beyond the copper mines of 
<br/><span class="">Katanga</span>. - Still further West 
<br/>&amp; beyond the Kone Range or 
<br/>plateau rises our old acquaintance 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the <span class="">Zambesi</span> by the name 
<br/><span class="">Zambaji</span>. Referring back 
<br/>to 12° South - It was rarely 
<br/>possible to obtain even a 
<br/>latitude but accidentally 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>awaking one morning 
<br/>after we were fairly on 
<br/>the upland I found a 
<br/>star which shewed lat. 11° 
<br/>56′ south - and next day 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>we crossed two rivulets 
<br/>running North - As we 
<br/>advanced brooks became 
<br/>numerous - some went 
<br/>backwards or sideways into 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the <span class="">Loangwa</span> &amp; with it to join 
<br/>the <span class="">Zambesi</span> at <span class="">Zumbo</span> - 
<br/>but the greatest number went 
<br/>North or Nor-West into 
<br/>the river <span class="">Chambeze</span>. This, misled 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>by a map calling it an 
<br/>offhand manner "<span class="underline "><span class="">Zambesi, 
<br/>Eastern branch</span></span>" - I took to 
<br/>be the river so indicated 
<br/>but the <span class="">Chambeze</span> with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>all its branches flows from 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>the</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>the side into the centre of 
<br/>the great <span class="">Nile</span> valley - It is 
<br/>remarkable as helping to form 
<br/>three lakes and changing 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>its name three times in 
<br/>the 500 or 600 miles of its 
<br/>course - First of all it is 
<br/>the <span class="">Chambeze</span> which I 
<br/>crossed in 10° 34′ south - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I crossed several of its 
<br/>confluents both on its South 
<br/>&amp; North quite as large as 
<br/>the <span class="">Isis</span> at <span class="">Oxford</span> but running 
<br/>faster &amp; having hippopotami 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>in them. I mention these 
<br/>animals because when 
<br/>navigating the <span class="">Zambesi</span>
<br/>I steered always boldly on 
<br/>to where these beasts lay 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>sure of never finding less 
<br/>than eight feet of water - 
<br/>The <span class="">Chambeze</span> flows into 
<br/><span class="">Lake Bangweolo</span>, &amp; on 
<br/>coming out of it assumes 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the name <span class="">Luapula</span>. <span class="">Luapula</span> - 
<br/>flows down north past the 
<br/>town of <span class="">Cazembe</span> and then 
<br/>enters <span class="">Lake Moero</span>. On emerging 
<br/>from it the name <span class="">Lualaba</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>is taken. In passing on N. 
<br/>N. West it becomes very 
<br/>large and forms <span class="">Wenge</span> in 
<br/>the country West of 
<br/><span class="">Tanganyika</span>. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>I have seen it only where it 
<br/>leaves <span class="">Moero</span> by a crack in 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>the</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>the mountains of <span class="">Rua</span> &amp; where 
<br/>it comes out again and am 
<br/>sure it is sufficient to form 
<br/><span class="">Wenge</span> whether it is a Lake 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>with many islands in it 
<br/>or a Punjaub if I may use 
<br/>the word before the waters 
<br/>are all gathered up by the 
<br/><span class="">Lupira</span> a large river which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>drains the Western side 
<br/>of the great valley and having 
<br/>its sources between 11° and 12° S. 
<br/>Beyond <span class="">Wenge</span> &amp; <span class="">Wenge </span>itself 
<br/>is purely native information, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and some believe that 
<br/>when <span class="">Lupira</span> takes it up 
<br/>it flows N.N.W. into a 
<br/>large lake named <span class="">Chowambe</span>
<br/>which I conjecture to be that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>discovered by <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Baker</span>, 
<br/>others think that it goes 
<br/>into <span class="">Tanganyika</span> &amp; flows 
<br/>thence into <span class="">Chowambe</span>
<br/>by river named <span class="">Loanda</span>. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>I suspend my judgment 
<br/>but think if the immense 
<br/>amount of water I have 
<br/>seen going North does 
<br/>not flow past <span class="">Lake 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>Tanganyika</span> on the West 
<br/>it must have an exit &amp; 
<br/>in all probability it is 
<br/>by the <span class="">Loanda</span>- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Referring again to the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Upland I found it divided 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>into</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>into districts - <span class="">Lobisa</span> - <span class="">Lobemba</span>
<br/><span class="">Wungu</span>- <span class="">Itawa</span>- <span class="">Lopere</span> - 
<br/><span class="">Kabuire</span> - <span class="">Lunda</span>- &amp;<span class="">Rua</span>
<br/>the people are known by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>putting Ba- instead of 
<br/>the intitial <span class="del cancelled">letter</span> syllable 
<br/>for country Lo or U - the 
<br/>Arabs use Wa instead of 
<br/>Ba as that is Luaheli - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>On the slope North &amp; in the 
<br/><span class="">Banglungu</span> country I discovered 
<br/><span class="">Lake Liemba</span> on 2<span class="sup underline ">nd</span> April 
<br/>1867. It lies in a hollow with 
<br/>precipitous sides 2000 feet 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>down. It is extremely 
<br/>beautiful, sides, top &amp; bottom 
<br/>being <span class="add  above">richly</span> clothed with trees 
<br/>&amp; other vegetation. Elephants 
<br/>buffaloes and antelopes feed 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>on the steep slopes, fish &amp; 
<br/>hippopotami swarm in 
<br/>the waters - two rocky islands 
<br/>are inhabited by fishermen 
<br/>who besides fishing cultivate 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the ground &amp; rear goats 
<br/>the Lake is not large, 
<br/>from 18 to 20 miles broad, 
<br/>and from 30 to 40 long - 
<br/>Four good-sized rivers flow 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>into it and many "burns", 
<br/><span class="underline ">Scotia</span> for brooks, which 
<br/>form pretty cascades as 
<br/>they leap down the 
<br/>bright red clay schist rocks - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>It goes away in a riverlike 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>prolongation</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>prolongation two miles wide 
<br/>N.N.W. it is said to <span class="">Tanganyika</span>
<br/>Were it not 2800 feet above 
<br/>the sea I would consider it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>an arm of the Lake but 
<br/><span class="">Speke</span> makes it 1844 feet 
<br/>only. I tried to follow - 
<br/>this arm but was prevented 
<br/>by war. A large party of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Arab traders from <span class="">Zanzibar</span>
<br/>had been attacked by the 
<br/><span class="">Chief of Itawa</span>. I set off 
<br/>to go round about the 
<br/>disturbed district met 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the Arabs and having 
<br/>shewed them <span class="">Seyed Majid's</span>
<br/>letter was at once supplied 
<br/>with cloth beads &amp; provisions 
<br/>thanks to your good offices 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>with the Sultan I have 
<br/>been treated by all the 
<br/>Arabs with the greatest 
<br/>kindness and consideration. 
<br/>The heads of the party 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>readily perceived that a 
<br/>continuance of hostilities 
<br/>meant shutting up the ivory 
<br/>market - so peace was made 
<br/>but the process required 3 1/2 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>months. They would not allow 
<br/>me to go into any danger 
<br/>so I had to remain at a 
<br/>village 4700 feet above the 
<br/>sea &amp; employ my time in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the pig's employment of

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>taking on fat. When we did move 
<br/>we went some way West 
<br/>with my Arab friends &amp; I 
<br/>am glad that I saw their 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>mode of ivory &amp; slavetrading
<br/>It was such a contrast to 
<br/>that of the ruffians from 
<br/><span class="">Kilwa</span> &amp; the Portuguese from 
<br/><span class="">Tette</span>. On leaving them 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>we came to <span class="">Moeru</span> on the 
<br/>8<span class="sup underline ">th</span> Nov<span class="sup underline ">r</span> 1867. This in the 
<br/>Northern part is from 20 
<br/>to 33 miles broad - Further 
<br/>south it is at least 60 miles 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>in width &amp; it is 50 miles 
<br/>long, ranges of tree-covered 
<br/>mountains flank it on both 
<br/>sides - We passed up its 
<br/>Eastern shore &amp; visited 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Cazembe</span> who has several 
<br/>times been visited by 
<br/>Portuguese. I remained 
<br/>40 days with <span class="">Cazembe</span> &amp; 
<br/>might have come on to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Bangweolo</span> but the rains 
<br/>had set in &amp; this Lake 
<br/>was reported to be very 
<br/>unhealthy - not having a 
<br/>grain of any kind of medicine 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and as fever without 
<br/>treatment produced fits of 
<br/>total insensibility &amp; loss of 
<br/>power over the muscles of 
<br/>the back I thought it would 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>be unwise to venture. 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>Went</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0009</span>
<br/>Went North intending to go 
<br/>to <span class="">Ujiji</span> for goods &amp; letters 
<br/>not having heard a word 
<br/>of any kind from anywhere 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for two years, but I was 
<br/>brought to a stand at a 
<br/>distance of thirteen <span class="add  above">days</span> from 
<br/><span class="">Tanganyika</span> by the 
<br/>superabundance of water 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>in the country in front. 
<br/>A native party came through 
<br/>&amp; described the waters as 
<br/>often thigh &amp; waste deep 
<br/>and sleeping places difficult 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to find. This inundation 
<br/>lasts till May or June. When 
<br/>I became utterly tired of 
<br/>inactivity I doubled back 
<br/>on my course to <span class="">Cazembe</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>in April and that you 
<br/>may understand the 
<br/>nature of the flood that 
<br/>here annually enacts the 
<br/>part of the <span class="">Nile</span> further 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>down I may say that 
<br/>two rivulets each from 
<br/>30 to 40 yards broad flow 
<br/>into the North end of <span class="">Moero</span>
<br/>One had a quarter and the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>other half a mile of flood 
<br/>on each bank - from thigh 
<br/>to waist deep. They were 
<br/>crossed by bridges - Then 
<br/>one of them had flooded 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>a plain abreast of <span class="">Moero</span>
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>and</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0010</span>
<br/>and we had four hours of 
<br/>plunging in waters &amp; black 
<br/>mud. The last mile was 
<br/>the worst though the rest 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>had many deep ruts into 
<br/>which from not seeing 
<br/>them we plunged and 
<br/>sent up a rush of hundreds 
<br/>of bubbles to the surface 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>all charged with a frightful 
<br/>odour. Before getting out 
<br/>to the clean sandy beach 
<br/>of <span class="">Moero</span> the flood water 
<br/>was up high on the chest. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Then we had to wade 4 
<br/>brooks thigh deep - cross a 
<br/>river 80 yards broad with 
<br/>300 yards of flood on 
<br/>its Western bank so deep 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>we had to keep to the 
<br/>canoes till within 50 
<br/>yards of the higher 
<br/>grounds - Four other brooks 
<br/>had to be forded ere we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>reached <span class="">Cazembe</span>.  One 
<br/>the <span class="">Chungu</span> was the scene 
<br/>of <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Lourda's</span> death. He 
<br/>was the only Portuguese of 
<br/>any scientific acquirements 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and was fifty miles wrong 
<br/>in Latitude alone. Probably 
<br/>fever clouded his mind 
<br/>when he observed and 
<br/>anyone who knows what 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>that implies will readily 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>excuse</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<br/>excuse any mistake he may 
<br/>have made. The <span class="">Chunga</span> 
<br/>went high up on the chest 
<br/>and one had to walk on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>tiptoe to avoid swimming. 
<br/>Only four of my attendants 
<br/>would come. The others 
<br/>absconded on various pretexts 
<br/>the fact is they are all tired 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of this everlasting tramping 
<br/>and so am I. Nothing could 
<br/>be bought but the veriest 
<br/>necessities - no paper only 
<br/>a couple of note-books &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the Bible. I have borrowed 
<br/>this and another sheet from 
<br/>an Arab trader. The other 
<br/>is for <span class="">Lord Clarendon</span> &amp; they 
<br/>will go by a party proceeding 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to the coast through <span class="">Usango</span>. 
<br/>I would go myself if it were 
<br/>not for an inveterate dislike 
<br/>to give up what I have 
<br/>undertaken without 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>finishing it. I am often 
<br/>distressed in thinking of a 
<br/>son whom I left at the 
<br/>University of <span class="">Glasgow</span>. He was 
<br/>to be 2 years there then spend 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>a year or more in <span class="">Germany</span>
<br/>for French &amp; German before 
<br/>trying the civil service 
exam-<br/>ination for <span class="">India</span>. He will 
<br/>now be in especial need of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>my counsel &amp; assistance and 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>here</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0012</span>
<br/>here I am at <span class="">Bangweolo</span>. 
<br/>His elder brother after being 
<br/>well educated wandered 
<br/>into the American war &amp; we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>know no more of him after 
<br/>an engagement before <span class="">Richmond</span>. 
<br/>Possibly <span class="">Sir Charles Wood</span> in 
<br/>consideration of my services 
<br/>might do something to fix 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>this one. I never asked 
<br/>anything for myself <span class="">Lord 
<br/>Palmerston</span> sent <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Hayward</span>
<br/>a Queen's Cousel to me before 
<br/>I left home this time to ask 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>"what he could do for me as 
<br/>"he was most anxious to serve 
<br/>me" I don't know how it 
<br/>was, but it never once occurred 
<br/>to me till I was in here 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>that he meant anything 
<br/>for myself. I replied that 
<br/>if he could open the 
<br/>Portuguese ports in <span class="">East Africa</span>
<br/>to free trade this was the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>greatest boon he could 
<br/>confer. I thought only of 
<br/>my work &amp; not of myself 
<br/>or children. I feel more at 
<br/>liberty in telling you of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>my domestic anxiety and 
<br/>my fears lest <span class="">Tom</span> should 
<br/>go to the examination 
<br/>unprepared because you 
<br/>have a family yourself 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>and will sympathize with me. 
<br/><span class="fw catch center" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>I shall</span>
