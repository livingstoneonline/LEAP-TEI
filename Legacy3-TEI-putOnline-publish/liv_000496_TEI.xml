<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="16" unit="chars"/>Having lately travelled in company with <persName><choice><abbr>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi></abbr><expan>Reverend</expan></choice> R. Edwards</persName> a distance 
<lb/><space extent="3" unit="chars"/>between <measure>6 &amp; 700 miles</measure> in the <placeName><region>interior</region></placeName> of this country and visited many tribes 
<lb/><space extent="3" unit="chars"/><term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> some never before seen by missionaries, I lose no time in 
<lb/>transmitting you some information respecting the state &amp; prospects of the 
<lb/>cause of Christ among them -</p>
<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> you are already aware are divided into a great many 
<lb/>distinct tribes or clans and they extend a great way into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName></p>
<lb/><p>Many of them have not yet been visited by any <orgName>European</orgName>, the language 
<lb/>of the whole is however essentially the same varying less in proportion 
<lb/>to the extent of country they occupy than do the different dialects in 
<lb/>the provinces of our own empire - The feudal system of <w>govern-
<lb break="no"/>ment</w> <unclear cert="high">obtains </unclear> amongst them in all its glory and in many respects 
<lb/>they resemble the <orgName>Ancient Highlanders</orgName> - Each clan is governed by its 
<lb/>own <term type="occupation">chieftain</term> who comes into office by right of birth and although 
<lb/>hereditary succession produces just the same effects here as in more 
<lb/>civilized countries, each <term type="occupation">chief</term> looks upon himself as a wiser &amp; 
<lb/>better man than <del>all</del><add place="over-text">any</add> <add place="above">of</add> his tribe and superior to all his contemporaries</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">He has the power of life &amp; death - the administration of the laws and 
<lb/>many prerequisites of office - Although he has <term type="occupation">councellors</term> who in 
<lb/>public assemblies are allowed by law to use the greatest freedom 
<lb/>of speech towards him, yet all the people are in a state of abject 
<lb/>subjection to his authority - <space extent="4" unit="chars"/> The different tribes possess with 
<lb/>respect to each other feelings similar to those of the <term type="occupation">chiefs</term> to their 
<lb/>fellows - One tribe calls itself a race of kings &amp; superior to all 
<lb/>others while a neighbouring tribe indulges the same lofty pretensions 
<lb/>to superior dignity in the scale of humanity - This clannish pride 
<lb/>has fortunately vanished considerably during the last 10 years or so 
<lb/>but previous to that period it stood at such a height. It was 
<lb/>hardly possible for <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> to endure it - No foreigners were 
<lb/>could be equal in  point of wisdom &amp;c. to the royal <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> - <w>conseq<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>uently</w> to deal with them a large stack of patience &amp; self denial 
<lb/>were <del type="strikethrough">requisite</del> <add place="above">needed</add> and these seem to have been possessed in the requisite 
<lb/>degree by <persName>Read</persName>, <persName>Hamilton</persName> &amp;c. Those devoted pione<add place="above">e</add>rs of this Mission 
<lb/>who have now grown <del type="cancelled">old</del><add place="above">grey</add> in their work of faith &amp; labour of love 
<lb/><unclear cert="high">At present</unclear> only the remnants of this haughty spirit prevail
<lb/>Very few consider themselves equal to foreigners and we can 
<lb/>now travel through the whole country without fear of molestation</p>
<lb/><p>The question now becomes one of interest, to what is this <w>favor<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-able</w> change to be attributed? And to us whose prejudices are on the 
<lb/>side of the gospel it would be pleasant could we place it to the 
<lb/>account of the operation of that mighty agent But when we 
<lb/>take a retrospective glance at the events which have transpired 
<lb/>in this country within the last 20 years and examine the state 
<lb/>&amp; feelings of those who have been most in contact with <w>Missi<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-on's</w> and those also who on account of their distance know nothing 
<lb/>at all about these things We shall be compelled to give the credit 
<lb/>of the change to an instrumentality far less to be admired
<lb/>But while we cannot feel any complacency in the instrument -</p>

<lb/>that I have succeeded in making them feel that our best mode is just to follow in the same tract as that in which the 
<lb/>others have been so eminently blessed - they are now both wishing they had it in their power to plant</p>

<lb/>Him who has in all ages &amp; countries carried on his purpose right through 
<lb/>heart of human wickedness &amp; canstantly brought good out of evil</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">And since in this country a great good has followed the horrid scourge 
<lb/>of war <del type="strikethrough">they</del><add place="above">are</add> we <del type="strikethrough">not be</del> justified in turning our eyes with intense interest 
<lb/>to another large portion of the world, long shut against the gospel, where 
<lb/>war is now actually in progress, and confidently expect that however 
<lb/>unjustifiable the pretext for that may be, it will eventually turn out 
<lb/>for the advancement of that <del type="cancelled">place</del><add place="above">kingdom</add>  which consists of righteousness &amp; 
<lb/>peace. <add place="inline" rend="small"><space extent="7" unit="chars"/>The finder of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> rendered them one once nearly as insensible to the 
<lb/><space extent="15" unit="chars"/>gospel as the laws in China now do hurt successive scourges have humbled them <add place="below">greatly</add></add></p>
<lb/><p>At a time when pride &amp; arrogance were rampant amongst the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>a large swarm of marauders more savage than they came pouring 
<lb/>down <add place="below">Ë„</add><add place="above">from the interior</add> upon those nearer to the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> - Their cruelties &amp; successes 
<lb/>spread terror though the whole country, one tribe fell before them 
<lb/>after another <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> they were thought invicible by the thousands 
<lb/>of fugitives who flocked towards the South; But a few mounted 
<lb/><orgName>Griquas</orgName> with guns succeeded in <unclear cert="high">routing</unclear> the whole with immense 
<lb/>slaughter of the invaders &amp; scarcely any loss to themselves</p>
<lb/><p>By &amp; Bye came another swarm  more dreadful than the former 
<lb/>under <persName>Moselekatsi</persName>, they spared none except the young men who 
<lb/>were capable of being soldiers - the old men with the women &amp; children 
<lb/>were all cruelly butchered. As in the former case those who <add place="below">Ë„</add><add place="above">could</add> escape 
<lb/>fled in terror in this direction and <persName>Moselekatsi</persName> following came 
<lb/>with <del type="cancelled">2</del><add place="above">2</add> weeks of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>, there, having ventured to capture the 
<lb/>waggons of some <orgName>Boers</orgName> &amp; put some of them to death he aroused 
<lb/>the vengeance of their relatives who although a mere handful in 
<lb/>number <unclear cert="high">routed</unclear> &amp; compelled him to retire far into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. These 
<lb/>successive defeats of powerful marauders have contibuted more towards 
<lb/>producing an impression of the superiority of <orgName>Europeans</orgName> than anything 
<lb/>else - This applies more especially to the tribes who have not been 
<lb/>subjected to the scourge of <orgName>European</orgName> warfare - What the effect is on
<lb/>the minds of the people of <persName>Moselekatsi</persName> I have not had an opportunity 
<lb/>of ascertaining - Most probably they are "chafed in their minds" 
<lb/>and the possibilty of our intercourse with them may for a long 
<lb/>time be retarded</p>
<lb/><p>Those tribes which in the time of danger flocked around the 
<lb/>mission stations have <del type="strikethrough">mostly</del><add place="above">all</add> retired, not so far inland as they 
<lb/>formerly were. The terror of <persName>Moselekatsi</persName>'s name is still <w>every-
<lb break="no"/>where</w> fresh in their minds preventing <unclear cert="medium">the</unclear><del type="strikethrough">return northwards</del>. But 
<lb/>there is one unfortunate feature in the character of all the tribes 
<lb/>who have been within the sphere of missionary operations 
<lb/>they know somewhat of the requirements of the gospel but 
<lb/>they are all decidedly averse to it, those tribes who have 
<lb/>never been near <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> always behaved with more respect 
<lb/>&amp; kindness than those who had. At a point <measure>250 miles</measure> nearly 
<lb/>directly north, the people had never before seen a white face - 
<lb/>There they were all we could expect a savage nation to be, &amp;  
<lb/>forcibly reminded us of those in a similar state in the <placeName><region>South Seas</region></placeName>

<lb/>them - for in general they are regular fools) Another tribe which 
<lb/>received us courteously we found busily employed in the manufacture 
<lb/>of large wooden bowls, each bowl being hollowed out from the 
<lb/>section of a large tree, costs an immense deal of labour - In addition 
<lb/>to this they were smelting iron for knives spears axes &amp;c</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">The manufacture seemed in its crudest state - Indeed it seems

<lb/>of these antediluvian <del type="cancelled">workers</del><add place="above">artificers</add> in iron, the ore in abundance 
<lb/>they find in the neighbouring mountains - To make up 
<lb/>for their want of knowledge in the manufacture &amp; frequent 
<lb/>accidents in burning the iron to a cinder, they have  
<lb/>many superstitions such as abstinence from connubial 
<lb/>intercourse for several months during which they work
<lb/>the iron &amp;c. &amp;c. There are also manufactures of <del type="cancelled">brass</del> copper &amp;
<lb/>tin amongst them but these have more superstitions still
<lb/>Indeed the further we went towards the north we found 
<lb/>superstition increasing &amp; probably it does increase <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice>
<lb/>we reach the region where idols are worshipped</p>
<lb/><p>All whom we visited far in the <placeName><region>interior</region></placeName> treated us with great 
<lb/>respect &amp; listened attentively to the preaching of the gospel, this <choice><abbr>att<hi rend="sup">n</hi></abbr><expan>attention</expan></choice>
<lb/>of course can be attributed to nothing but the effect of novelty
<lb/>But I am persuaded they are much more likely to receive the 
<lb/>gospel than those who live within <measure>100 or 150 miles</measure> of this 
<lb/>&amp; Who generally now merit the appellation of scorners &amp; refectors of the truth</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">You may be surprised to hear that this state of matters exists amongst those 
<lb/>who lately lived near mission stations - But what else can be expected 
<lb/>from heathens in their sins only occasionally hearing a detached sermon

<lb/>the truth must be brought to bear repeatedly on the mind of the same 
<lb/>individual - the heathen are in a totally different position from

<lb/>it is hardly possible for the truth to find its way through the thick 
<lb/>darkness which shrouds the mind of the <orgName>natives</orgName> by any means but 
<lb/>a continually pouring it upon them - And after all our chief 
<lb/>hope is in the young, but little comparatively can or has been 
<lb/>done with the old - You must not imagine from the style of 
<lb/>the foregoing remarks that I in the least disparage the labours 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000496_0004"/><!--pb/@n='77v'-->
<lb/>of the devoted bretheren who have long laboured amongst these people <unclear cert="medium">the</unclear> it 
<lb/>has not been from any defect in their preaching that the unfortunate state 
<lb/>of the tribes immediately beyond us has resulted - It has been from the 
<lb/>want of means to carry on more extensive operations - their efforts 
<lb/>for want of more agents have been too much confined to one spot 
<lb/>Occasionally visits have been made to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> But for want of 
<lb/>others to supply their places at the station these attempts have been too 
<lb/>desultory in their nature to result in <del type="cancelled">m</del> much good - It would 
<lb/>require many <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> at different points in the country 
<lb/>before the great body of the people can be influenced,  this <unclear cert="medium">defining</unclear>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">To ascertain if you can do anything at all for us in this respect 
<lb/>is my object in writing to you - I don't expect you to publish 
<lb/>this though you were kind enough to request me to write some

<lb/><orgName>native</orgName> agency he appears to have changed his views a little for he  
<lb/>wrote back again instructing the bretheren here to make a trial 
<lb/>of two. These are stationed one at a village <measure>16 miles</measure> off 
<lb/>Northwards the other much farther to the North East &amp; now 
<lb/>although it is only a few years since they were appointed 
<lb/>each has many more members under him than on 
<lb/>the station here. And they are more consistent in their 
<lb/>walk and so kind to each other it is quite a treat to visit 
<lb/>them after living sometime with those here - The chief accessions 
<lb/>to the church have also been from their ministry, and 
<lb/>indeed this was to be expected for the truth seems to find its 
<lb/>way to the heart much sooner from their lips than 
<lb/>from a foreigner - In their hands it is divested of that

<lb/>the power of contributing effectually to the relief of the sufferer

<lb/>idea previously that disease existed to such an extent in
<lb/>uncivilized life - At one small town I had about 40 really

<lb/>know anyone willing to contribute so much more than 
<lb/>they are already doing to the cause of Christ, I can assure 
<lb/>them they employ a most efficient mode of spreading 
<lb/>the gospel for during the first few years of a 
<lb/>mission at least by teaching the children to read &amp;

<lb/>in hunting &amp;c. but at these times they employ another &amp; pay

<lb/>they are not unmindful of their obligations even when far

<lb/>They sometimes collect the <orgName>natives</orgName> of villages together &amp; tell them

<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> yet imagine we are partial &amp; have favourites - It is of great 
<lb/>importance for the <term type="occupation">missionary</term> to appear as a Universal friend - If I had 
<lb/>clothes publicly committed to my trust, to be distributed publicly I should 
<lb/>consider it a calamity - The only way to avoid the evil is to do all 
<lb/>privately &amp; never give without making them work some to make 
<lb/>them feel they have earned what they have got. When things are 
<lb/>given gratuitously it takes away all the feeling of independency 
<lb/>and teaches them to become beggars without shame - Lately some

<lb/>appear in <orgName>European</orgName> gowns which look much neater than the

<lb/>of the Deity were addressed to us in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> and even here
<lb/>it is not uncommon in requesting a favour to do so with some

<lb/>the significant titles <term type="animal">dog</term>, <term type="animal">wolf</term>, <term type="animal">tiger</term>, <term type="animal">lion</term>, are given with just as

<lb/>The feeling in his mind is not to be wondered at, the Church has

<lb/>taken by the hand &amp; raised from indigence to <del type="strikethrough">I</del> affluence those 
<lb/>very men who insult him at every church meeting) they 
<lb/>ought to be reprobated by all the world - No doubt he has 
<lb/>had faults &amp; who has not? but these must have been
