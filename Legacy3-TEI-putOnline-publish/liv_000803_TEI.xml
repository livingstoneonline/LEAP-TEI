<lb/>manuscripts with which I take the liberty to trouble you - The faggot contains 
<lb/>observations made at different parts of the country and I venture to
<lb/>send them such as they are because you mentioned that you preferred 
<lb/>such to those which have passed through the adulterating process of an 
<lb/><orgName>African</orgName> calculation. If you read them backwards like Hebrew viz. 
<lb/>beginning with the fifth or sixth <del type="strikethrough">page</del><add place="above">sheet</add> I shall feel obliged for 
<lb/>then you will be able to see the reason why I sent such 
<lb/>poor things as those made from the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> Northwards</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">I found or thought I found that our Longitudes of last 
<lb/>journey were all wrong, our waggon stand instead of being in 
<lb/><measure>26º</measure> is not more than <measure>23º 48′ or 50′</measure> - But I have not so much 
<lb/>confidence in my calculations as to assert this without serious 
<lb/><add place="marginleft" hand="#hand01" rend="gray">X</add> misgivings - When I found that the <orgName>Boers</orgName> had destroyed my 
<lb/>celestial map - I set off to work on the Lunars and persevered 
<lb/><choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> I think I have mastered the methods given in <persName>Thomson</persName>'s
<lb/>Tables perfectly, I made many observations between <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and this but working with the inverting telescope chiefly I placed 
<lb/>no value on them - My chief aim was to acquire as much 
<lb/>facility with it as with the small telescope, I have succeeded 
<lb/>in this too, but when I found out longitudes were wrong 
<lb/>I felt sorry I had not written down all my observations - 
<lb/>Those I have put down are from the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> Northwards 
<lb/>and were made in trying to work with the sextant fixed on 
<lb/>a stand with a movable joint - they are very precise but 
<lb/>the time required to get the mercury into the right position in 
<lb/>turning from one object to another, and above all this difficulty 
<lb/>of getting the instrument adjusted to the different angles in which 
<lb/>Lunars are observed rendered this effort after many trials 
<lb/>abortive - I thought however that you may be able to 
<lb/>make something of them, perhaps determine whether the <choice><abbr>Long-</abbr><expan>Longitude</expan></choice> 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> is right - I worked out many here before 
<lb/>coming to the conclusion that <measure>26º</measure> was wrong, and a new 
<lb/>idea has lately entered my head which makes me fear 
<lb/>that <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Morton</persName> may be right after all - I have been

<lb/>taken in the morning or evening but the sun's declination has
<lb/>always <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> lately been North and I suspect the true time cannot
<lb/>be obtained when the station (Latitude of) and Declination are of
<lb/>contrary names <space unit="chars" extent="2"/> I have not time at present to work out another 
<lb/>being busy writing for the present which is the only opportunity
<lb/>I have had of transmitting letters to the <placeName><region>South</region></placeName> - you will please
<lb/>take notice of this source of error - Nobody requires to have
<lb/>all his wits about him so much as <del type="strikethrough">those</del><add place="above">he</add> who ha<del>ve</del><add place="over-text">s</add> anything
<lb/>to do with the stars - My chief hope lies in the occultations few
<lb/>and inexplicit though these are -</p>
<lb/><p>I am now waiting for the commencement of the
<lb/><seg type="weather">rains</seg> in order to proceed Westward on <term type="animal">horse</term>back - <orgName><term type="occupation"><orgName>Slave</orgName> merchants</term></orgName>
<lb/>report it impossible to go in waggons There are so many rivers
<lb/>and thick forests - They are carried in hammocks slung to poles
	<lb/>It does not look well - The <orgName>slaves</orgName> admired my walking and
	<lb/>especially marching through small rivers which abound in the
	<lb/><placeName><region><term type="tribe">Barotse</term> country</region></placeName> without thinking I was doing anything extraordinary
	<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Barotse</term> who were with me called out "Hello <persName>Mambari</persName> your
	<lb/>father is a child - you <foreign xml:lang="und">pépa</foreign> him", a child's word for nurse - the poor
	<lb/>fellows were quite of the same opinion - The heat is lessened 
	<lb/>when the <seg type="weather">rains</seg> commence So should my <term type="animal">horse</term> die the walk
	<lb/>will not be so trying - I think of <placeName><settlement type="city">Londa</settlement></placeName> though it is
	<lb/>farther than <unclear cert="medium"><placeName><settlement type="village">Banguela</settlement></placeName></unclear> because there are <term type="nationality">English</term> living
	<lb/>there - <space extent="2" unit="chars"/> The <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> maps are all constructed from <orgName>Native</orgName>
	<lb/>information - A <term type="nationality">French</term> man <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> various honours
	<lb/>for determining some points - and the <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> <term type="occupation">merchants</term>
	<lb/>assert that he was never known to have travelled in <placeName><region>Western
	<lb/>Africa</region></placeName> at all - If I am permitted to follow out my
	<lb/>plan I shall return - through <placeName><settlement type="city">Londa</settlement></placeName>, the capital of a powerful
	<lb/>state, down the <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeba</geogName></placeName> - Should my return be prevented
	<lb/>I shall not have any occultations for you, because I 
	<lb/>do not know the stars which are to be occulted in
	<lb/>the next three months - But in <date when="1854-01">January 1854</date> I see 
	<lb/>several which I believe I know γ Leonis for instance
	<lb/>on the <date when="1854-01-16">16<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date> if the moon is not too far down and

	<lb/>perhaps be seen on the <date when="1854-04-08">8<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date> &amp; <date when="1854-04-15">15 April</date> but where I shall
	<lb/>be it is hard to tell - I suppose it will be best for me to
	<lb/>multiple observations of Lunar distances</p>

<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000803_0003"/><!--pb/@n='11r'-->
<lb/><p>I have enclosed a letter to <persName><choice><abbr>Lieut<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi></abbr><expan>Lieutenant</expan></choice> Colonel Steele</persName>. It is not <add place="marginright" rend="gray" hand="#hand01">11</add>
	<lb/>a private letter but intended for the <orgName>Royal Geographical Society</orgName>, so
<lb/>you need feel no hesitation in reading it - I feel rather anxious
<lb/>that you should peruse it in order to see whether I have said too
<lb/>much on the subject of the Longitude - If you will add a note
<lb/>to correct my mistake it will make the communication so much
	<lb/>more valuable - Your family <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mann</persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morton</persName> are welcome
<lb/>to a perusal if they wish it - Please just do with the observations
<lb/>whatever you think best - Send them to any of your friends who
<lb/>may take an interest in such things and draw your pen
<lb/>through my remarks about the calculation if it does not
<lb/>please you - The sketch is intended to give a correct idea of 
<lb/>what I saw and no more - I took the bearings of every reach
<lb/>of the river both in ascending and descending - It became very
<lb/>long - In reducing it I may be wrong, so send a copy of the original
	<lb/>for cleverer persons to do better - If <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morton</persName> wishes to have
<lb/>a sketch of this too it is at his service; those who are at
<lb/>the head quarters of observations on <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> have the best
<lb/>right to early notices of any discoveries  - You will observe
<lb/>how very like the drawings of the <orgName>natives</orgName> from which we
<lb/>constructed our map are to that made from actual survey -
<lb/>I have not worked out a Lunar of our farthest point North
	<lb/>viz. the confluence the <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeba</geogName></placeName> and <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeambye</geogName></placeName> -
<lb/></p>
			<lb/><p>One of the <orgName><term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName> merchants</term></orgName> wished me to go Westward in 
<lb/>his company - He was as kind to me when I was up at the <term type="tribe">Barotse</term>
<lb/>as he could be, influenced probably by a letter from the <persName>chevalier 
<lb/>Du Pratt</persName>. but the sight of gangs of poor wretches in chains 
<lb/>was so much against the grain I resolved to proceed alone</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">He could speak no language, but Portuguese - We managed 
<lb/>to make a jargon - I caught all the words resembling latin 
<lb/>added other Latin terms to these and when very much at a 
<lb/>loss stuck in some big rough Dutch word to eke out the 
<lb/>sentence. It is so wonderful how soon one believes he understands 
<lb/>what is said, <persName>Cumming</persName> thought he could speak Sechuana 
<lb/>when he knew about four words - I have heard him call out 
	<lb/>"<term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term>" when he wanted his servant to beat the <term type="animal">oxen</term> and 
<lb/>he thought he must be understood because the whip was made
