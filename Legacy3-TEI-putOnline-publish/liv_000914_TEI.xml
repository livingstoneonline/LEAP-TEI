<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>As the supercargo of a ship
<lb/>wrecked of <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> came with us
<lb/>thus far and now leaves for the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>
<lb/>I give you a note in addition to a scrap
<lb/>written while still on the <placeName><bloc>African</bloc></placeName> soil.
<lb/>and which goes by the same hand.
<lb/>I took the chief man of the party of
<lb/><orgName><persName>Sekeletu</persName>'s people</orgName> who accompanied
<lb/>me to the coast with the intention of
<lb/>showing him the benefits which
<lb/><term type="faith">Christianity</term> has conferred on us as a
<lb/>nation. In going over the bar at
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> three breakers rolled over us
<lb/>and frightened him terribly. His large
<lb/>brig of 16 guns rolled at anchor with
<lb/>her bows under the boat seemed to
<lb/>rise up as high as the top of your church
<lb/>windows then down to the ground. We had

	<pb facs="liv_000914_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>to be taken on board in a chair. I thought 
<lb/>my friend looked bewildered ever after that
<lb/>but all the seamen <hi rend="sub">^</hi> <hi rend="sup">(130)</hi> liked him so much &amp; he
<lb/>them I thought he would do well. He became
<lb/>leaner however, saw a steamer towing us
<lb/>into this harbour, became mad during the
<lb/>night. Turned completely against all but
<lb/>myself, yet when I went near him he
<lb/>threatened to leap overboard. As he became
<lb/>better during the day I objected to using
<lb/>constraint lest it should make him
<lb/>worse and in the event of non-cure he
<lb/>might retain the remembrance of it and
<lb/>prejudice his countrymen against me -
<lb/>spoke quite rationally at midday but in
<lb/>the evening became worse and tried to
<lb/>stab an officer <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">(<term type="occupation">chief Carpenter</term>)</add> one of his great cronies
<lb/>then ran down and pulled himself below
<lb/>the water by the chain <unclear>cable</unclear> &amp; disappeared
<lb/>this is a great affliction for he was my
<lb/>right hand man and contributed greatly
<lb/>to my success. I felt deeply grateful to
<lb/>him and wished to <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> it. <persName>Sekeletu</persName> told
<lb/>them that all must go with me to MaRobert <!-- I have no clue on this word #BL--><!-- Nor sure here either, but to me does not look like Mozambique. SF --><!-- Fixed -->

	<pb facs="liv_000914_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>and when I spoke of the possibility of death
<lb/>ensuing all said <unclear>well</unclear> it will be in the
<lb/>service of <persName><foreign xml:lang="und">Morena</foreign></persName>. I found great difficulty
<lb/>in preventing others from coming though I
<lb/>explained the danger. Those who are wise
<lb/>after the fact will say O what will they
<lb/>not? I am as wise as any of them vow
<lb/>and bear the sorrow of the loss of a very
<lb/>good friend besides. <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>If you have an opportunity
<lb/>send word of the death to <persName>Sekeletu</persName>. To break
<lb/>the shock his name was <persName>Sekuebu</persName>.</p>
<lb/><p>Another called <persName>Monaheng</persName> a good man
<lb/>too went mad and fled from the camp
<lb/>we never saw him again &amp; the country
<lb/>being full of <term type="animal">lions</term> we never will.
<lb/>He walked with me &amp; spoke quite well
<lb/>the day before. But the tribe to which we
<lb/>came refused a bit of cloth we offered
<lb/>made a dance with all their arms in
<lb/>their hands - firing guns, shrieking &amp;c &amp;c.
<lb/>He thought we were about to be attacked
<lb/>and when we lay down he was observed
<lb/>to rise up and point to the town - "there" "there
<lb/>they are" fled I believe insane - Excitement <!-- last five lines  or so don't seem to make much sense to me, please review #BL-->

<lb/>from dangers upset that of poor <persName>Monaheng</persName>
<lb/><persName>(Monage√±)</persName> I have been seven times in peril of
<lb/>life, not from choice certainly. What do you
<lb/>say <persName>Ma Mary</persName>. Anything you like but you
<lb/>have two daughters and may yet get other
<lb/>two but though you had four parishes
<lb/>to pick out of you would not get a
<lb/>pluckie son in law though your 
<lb/>spectacles were on in the search. There's
<lb/>no going about the bush in that. Is there?</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">Will you add also in case of an
<lb/>opportunity that 20 tusks are left at
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> and all the goods <persName>Sekeletu</persName>
