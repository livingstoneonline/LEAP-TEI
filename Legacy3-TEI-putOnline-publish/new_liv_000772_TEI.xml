<lb/>time however you may publish <bibl><persName>Viljoen</persName>'s letter</bibl> in the
<lb/><bibl>Mail</bibl> or <bibl>Advertizer</bibl>. It is pretty fair from one who
<lb/>has been an extensive <term type="occupation">dealer</term> in gunpowder among the
<lb/><orgName>natives</orgName> and who I have no doubt had a load of the
<lb/>same article, then, in his <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> for sale. This is the
<lb/>same individual too who bought several boys at the

<lb/>you before I close this and if you thought proper you
<lb/>might send it on to the <orgName>Directors</orgName>. I have sent a

<lb/><term type="nationality">British</term> Resident <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Green</persName>. And <bibl>a letter</bibl> explanatory
<lb/>of the <bibl>documents</bibl> as violations of the provisions
<lb/>of the <bibl>treaty</bibl> of the <orgName>Commissioners</orgName>. It is somewhat
<lb/>in the same strain as that sent through you to

	

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000772_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>the <persName>Lieutenant Governor</persName> which I hope you <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>,
<lb/>but I conclude in the following manner "In the hope 
<lb/>that the communication of these facts may lead to the
<lb/>cessation of the violation <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">of the provisions &amp;c</add> of the <bibl>treaty</bibl>. <hi rend="underline">And compensation
<lb/>for losses sustained by such violation</hi>" I am &amp;c &amp;c <persName><choice><abbr>DL.</abbr><expan>David Livingstone</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>Now I have not the smallest expectation of any <w>com<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>pensation</w> but I thought I ought to make the losses
<lb/>known to the proper <orgName>authorities</orgName> so that they may have
<lb/>no excuse if they pay no attention to them. And as the
<lb/><persName><term type="nationality">British</term> Resident</persName> has two brothers now on a <term type="occupation">trading</term>
<lb/>expedition to <placeName><region><persName>Sebitoane</persName>'s country</region></placeName> and they having
<lb/>lost considerable property in the plundering of my
<lb/>house and burning of <placeName><settlement type="town"><persName>Sechele</persName>'s town</settlement></placeName> - Their relays
<lb/>of <term type="animal">cattle</term> too were taken away - All which property is
<lb/>believed to belong to the <persName><term type="nationality">British</term> Resident</persName> himself. It is
<lb/>not unlikely but that he may claim compensation
<lb/>and should he get it I may come in for a share. 
<lb/>At any rate it will look better for him to make a
<lb/>noise about my property than about his brothers'
<lb/>alias his own. The <orgName>Boers</orgName> are on the watch for his
<lb/>brothers and <persName>Webb</persName> who are in the country beyond
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>. Indeed we heard by some <term type="occupation">hunters</term>
<lb/>who came two days ago that the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> are waiting
<lb/>for the <term type="nationality">English</term> gentlemen somewhere between the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> and the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zouga</geogName></placeName> with laudable intention

	

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000772_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>of plundering them. I don't want the <term type="nationality">English</term> gentlemen
<lb/>to be killed but I am inclined to pray that they may
<lb/>be stripped to the buffs and come out like those bashful
<lb/>blades who were told to tarry at <placeName><settlement type="city">Jericho</settlement></placeName>. I am quite glad
<lb/>they have lost a good deal at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName>, I am only afraid
<lb/>they don't get insulted enough to make them speak out
<lb/>when they come to the <placeName><region>colony</region></placeName>. I being one of the "<orgName>Rebel
<lb/>maakers</orgName>" and a fanatic withal. The only comfort that
<lb/>will be bestowed on me will be "served him right"
<lb/>But if some of the Devil's children be hustled then we
<lb/>shall have <add place="above">a</add> decentish boohoo. I added a private
<lb/>note to the <persName><term type="nationality">British</term> Resident</persName> giving the news so far
<lb/>as we have heard then of his brothers, their losses.
<lb/>The success of their <term type="occupation">trading</term> at <placeName><region><persName>Sebitoane</persName>'s</region></placeName> and the
<lb/>probable plunder of all they have got &amp;c making the
<lb/>picture quite plain. He wont need spectacles to see
<lb/>the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> hauling out the big tusks out of his brothers'
<lb/><choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>, will he? And if he says nothing sharp to the
<lb/><orgName><orgName>Boer</orgName> Republic</orgName>, it will be because <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Commissioner
<lb/>Owen</persName> lays an embargo on everthing likely to disturb
<lb/>his <unclear cert="low">country</unclear>. So - the mighty fuss about punishing
<lb/><persName>Kreli</persName> has turned out a windbag. Well done <persName>Kreli</persName>! and
<lb/>you ye <term type="tribe">Fingoes</term> remember <persName>Botha</persName> - <foreign xml:lang="und">vebum sat. sap.</foreign>
<lb/>The world is becoming worse I fear. The <persName>Pope</persName> at
<lb/>home and <persName>Sandillah</persName> and <persName>General Uithaalder</persName> abroad what next?

	

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000772_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>Will you come to the dinner to <persName>Uithaalder</persName>? Of course he
<lb/>will get a dinner as well as <persName>Pretorius</persName>.The <persName><unclear cert="medium">Peit</unclear>
<lb/>Scholtz</persName> who was feasted at <placeName><region>Natal</region></placeName> with <persName>Pretorius</persName>
<lb/>was <term type="occupation">Commandant</term> at the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName>! He did not
<lb/>bury all the dead of his own <orgName>party</orgName>. And they are all
<lb/>now dreadfully exasperated at me. They say I taught
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> to shoot <orgName>Boers</orgName> and they will have my head
<lb/>yet. As I have still a little use for my head I am
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">still</del> on the look out here watching to see the path
<lb/>clear a head. And what think you is the drama in
<lb/>front. A <orgName>party of <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName></orgName> waiting beyond the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>
<lb/>to plunder &amp; perhaps kill a few <term type="people">Englishmen</term> and at the
<lb/>same time two <orgName>parties of <orgName>natives</orgName></orgName> on the look out to
<lb/>kill them. It will be a wonder if a <orgName><choice><sic>boer</sic><corr>Boer</corr></choice></orgName> escapes. 
<lb/>When the path is clear then I shall have run for
<lb/>it. <hi rend="underline">All is peace beyond</hi>. Some <orgName>Griqua</orgName> <term type="occupation">hunters</term>
<lb/>have approached the outposts of <persName>Mosilikatse</persName> and He
<lb/>sends a message to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat</persName> "Why <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> you come
<lb/>and see me, Be sure and come and bring a chair
<lb/>for me. All you told me (about the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName>) <add place="above">&amp; fighting &amp; killing</add> is true
<lb/>He wants to make peace with the <orgName>Griquas</orgName> &amp;c. O how
<lb/>I wish I were away in my own country. Swampy
<lb/>boggy though to be.. The reasons which make
<lb/>me doubt whether I ought to draw anything for
<lb/><persName>Mebaloe</persName> are the following and as you are fond

	

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000772_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> sheet 
<lb/>you may take it as part of the <orgName><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term>
<lb/>mission</orgName>. I mentioned to you that after three years
<lb/>consistent conduct and profession of faith in <persName>Christ</persName>
<lb/>I baptized <persName>Sechele</persName> on the first Sabbath of <date when="1848-10">October 1848</date>
<lb/>In <date when="1849-03">March</date> or <date when="1849-04">April 1849</date> it was discovered that
<lb/>he had had connection with one of his former
<lb/>wives whom in consequence of having a young
<lb/>child and no parents he had found impossible
<lb/>to send away with the others. He at once confessed
<lb/>his sin and added as an excuse that having been
<lb/>accustomed to her he had not at the time felt
<lb/>as if he were sinning by going to another man's
<lb/>wife. He professed much penitence entreating me
<lb/>not to cast him off "as he hoped to stand along
<lb/>with me before the throne of <persName>Jesus</persName>". I cut him
<lb/>off from fellowship and as he entreated to be
<lb/>allowed to remain as a <hi rend="underline">spectator</hi> only at the
<lb/>ordinance and I felt that I must not count him
<lb/>as an enemy, I acceded to his request. He 
<lb/>sat back from the spot where the few <orgName>believers</orgName> 
<lb/>communicated on two or three occasions which
<lb/>occurred subsequently to his fall and his manner
<lb/>being no ways changed from what it had been

	

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000772_0006"><!--pb/@n='3v'--></pb>
<lb/>previously I indulged the hope that if he continued
<lb/>to walk uprightly for two or three years we might
<lb/>again <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> him. Immediately after his fall
<lb/>I wrote to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> about it knowing that
<lb/>they would sympathize with me in my sorrow, and
<lb/>I mentioned to them subsequently the fact of his
<lb/>walking consistently. I thought this was sufficient
<lb/>unless I had restored him again. But as soon as I
<lb/>heard of his conduct in the case of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moyle</persName>
<lb/>as it seemed widely different from consistency, I
<lb/>wrote to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> a detailed account of the circumstances 
<lb/>and stated that I now considered him an entire
<lb/>backslider though not an apostate. I was the
<lb/>more careful to give the facts of his case because
<lb/>they had in some speeches made reference to his
<lb/>conversion, and some who did not of course know
<lb/>what I had written thought that I must still be
<lb/>holding up <persName>Sechele</persName> to the <orgName>Board</orgName> as a convert
<lb/>Well eight or ten months after <persName>Sechele</persName> was
<lb/>cut off a worse affair came to light amongst
<lb/>the young people belonging to the families of the
<lb/>two <orgName><orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term></orgName> <persName>Mebaloe</persName> and <persName>Paul</persName> <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> excessive
<lb/>impunity and when I began to make enquiry I
<lb/>found out that the <term type="occupation">teachers</term> must have known 

	

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000772_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/>of it and kept me in ignorance. This is a peculiarity
<lb/>among <orgName><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> believers</orgName>. They never will make known
<lb/>the sins of their fellow <orgName>believers</orgName> and when anything
<lb/>comes to light, then they quietly remark "O we knew
<lb/>all about it long ago" The wives of the <term type="occupation">teachers</term> too
<lb/>had been using enchantments. I felt very much vexed
<lb/>to think I had been administering the ordinance to them
<lb/>as consistent <orgName>believers</orgName>, and the whole town knowing
<lb/>all the while what their conduct had been. Their number
<lb/>being only seven I cut the whole off having <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">had</add> no ordinance
<lb/>at all since. None of them even asked why they were
<lb/>kept so, they seemed determined to act as if they
<lb/>had never been guilty or as if they believed that I
<lb/>knew nothing about it. <persName>Paul</persName>'s family being notoriously
<lb/>bad I requested him to leave but he did not go
<lb/><persName>Mebaloe</persName> however confessed to me before I went to
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> that they had done great harm to the cause
<lb/>in fact, said he, we have spoiled the teaching at
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName>. The <orgName>Boers</orgName> now have cleared out the
<lb/>whole of them. I did not pay them anything
<lb/>from the time I discovered their inconsistency but
<lb/><persName>Mebaloe</persName> having confessed his sin and also carried
<lb/>on the school up to the time of the <orgName>Boer</orgName>s' attack I may
<lb/>perhaps without impropriety draw a years salary 
<lb/>for him. I have not yet however made up my mind

	

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000772_0008"><!--pb/@n='4v'--></pb>
<lb/>There are always two sides to a story. Well the other side
<lb/>is this. <persName>Ashton</persName> <foreign xml:lang="la">loquitur</foreign> - "<persName><choice><orig>Livingston</orig><reg>Livingstone</reg></choice></persName> cut off the whole
<lb/>of the <orgName>believers</orgName> at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> because he had not moral
<lb/>courage to cut off <persName>Sechele</persName>." And he <choice><sic>recieves</sic><corr>receives</corr></choice> the delinquints
<lb/>into <orgName><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> church</orgName> without asking a note of demission
<lb/>according to the universal custom of the churches here
<lb/>Then again he proposed to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat</persName> to write a
<lb/><bibl>joint letter to the <orgName>Directors</orgName></bibl> denouncing my falsehood
<lb/>in holding up <persName>Sechele</persName> to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> as a convert
<lb/>all the while knowing that he is an apostate". <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/><choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> of course declined this. Now I am in a fix
<lb/>if I haul him up for his remarks it will be
<lb/>another quarrel such as took place nine years ago
<lb/>when <persName>Edwards</persName> and <persName>Inglis</persName> took it into their heads to
<lb/>say I quarrelled with them and which <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">quarrel</add> the <orgName>Directors</orgName>
<lb/>tell me now, still exists. If I let him alone and say
<lb/>nothing then he will be sure that his remark about
<lb/>my want of moral courage is correct. Shall I
<lb/>brave the row, or the imputation. I feel inclined
<lb/>to do the latter as requiring more courage than the
<lb/>former. This will be "Jouk &amp; let the jaw gang by"
<lb/>But I am giving you letters equal in length to the
<lb/><bibl>Times Newspaper</bibl> and you give me <choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> sheets. Take care

<lb/>but done nothing else except collecting words and

<lb/>I think of it, it grows on me and seems a work
<lb/>of a life time. And I suspect mine will not be
<lb/>a long one. I cannot get over the idea that
<lb/>complaining of one's ailments is old wifish yet
<lb/>a pain in my chest I never felt before when
<lb/>I exert myself to speak as loudly as I used to

<lb/>In <term type="occupation">preaching</term> in Sichuana which I do occasionally
<lb/>I feel at home and speak much more loudly and
