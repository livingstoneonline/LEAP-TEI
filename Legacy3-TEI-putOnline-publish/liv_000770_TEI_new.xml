<lb/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><persName>Rev<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> W. Thompson</persName></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>Enclosed you will <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> <bibl>a letter</bibl> which
<lb/>I have ventured to address to the <persName>Lieutenant Governor</persName>
<lb/>I have endeavoured to give a plain outline of the
<lb/>facts and merely hinted at the possible consequences
<lb/>and now if the <orgName>Government</orgName> goes on heedlessly
<lb/>the blame will rest on its own shoulders. I enclose
<lb/>it to you because I understand you are expected
<lb/>to be our go between in all matters pertaining to the 
<lb/><orgName>Government</orgName>. The reason which I feel the chief one
<lb/>in my mind for troubling you is that you may
<lb/>reverse your judgement on it whether it ought to be
<lb/>delivered at all － From it and <bibl><persName>Mr Moffat</persName>'s letter</bibl>
<lb/>you will have a pretty clear idea of the doings of
<lb/><orgName><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Robertson</persName>'s converts</orgName> - and may fancy that reverend
<lb/>sinner turning up the white of his eyes and saying to 
<lb/>them at the communion table "Eat O friends! drink, yea
<lb/>drink abundantly O beloved" － they went the whole hog
<lb/>attended church on Sunday hearing <persName>Mebaloe</persName> preach and  
<lb/>then made the <term type="occupation">parson</term> flee for his life on Monday
<lb/>he ran the gauntlet some of them calling out when
<lb/>they saw him with clothes on there is the <term type="occupation">chief</term> &amp;
<lb/>then the bullets whistled over behind &amp; before him
<lb/>he seems to have become terrified － ran through 
<lb/>the midst of the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> &amp; so fast his feet were
<lb/>dreadfully bruised － He has lost all he had － <choice><abbr>viz</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice>
<lb/>27 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term> &amp; his furniture &amp;c his house was
<lb/>burned by the <orgName><hi rend="underline">Christians</hi></orgName>. He it was who stood by
<lb/>me when bitten by the <term type="animal">lion</term> &amp; got bit himself － He
<lb/>has been with me ever since I came into the country</p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000770_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">but I fear this will be a settler for him － he is now on
<lb/>his way out here. Some fine young men whom I
<lb/>knew and loved have fallen － My heart is sore when
<lb/>I think of them － <persName>Sechele</persName> had two bullets through his hat
<lb/>and a third through his coat sleeve － the <orgName>Boers</orgName> have
<lb/>lost one of their principal men － I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know his
<lb/>name － The <term type="occupation">chief</term> with whom <persName>Inglis</persName> lives is heart &amp;
<lb/>soul with the <orgName>Boers</orgName>. He ought to leave. He has informed
<lb/><persName>Solomon</persName> that he is going to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> in order to send
<lb/>his wife and children to <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> <add place="above">not of course in imitation of me</add> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Edwards</persName> sends
<lb/>her children to <placeName><settlement type="town">Walthamstow</settlement></placeName> school. If you ask
<lb/>the opinion of the <orgName>Directors</orgName> you will find that they
<lb/>would like <persName>Inglis</persName> to come home too and there would 
<lb/>be little doubt but that he would remain there
<lb/><!-- beginning of vertical pencil line in left margin stretching over next 8 lines AM -->You may wonder what will be the end of all this
<lb/>and you may perhaps wonder still more if I venture to
<lb/>say that I see nothing in it all unfavourable to the
<lb/>progress of the kingdom of <persName>Christ</persName> － There is evidently
<lb/>a process in operation in the whole of <placeName><country>South Africa</country></placeName> －
<lb/>and there soon will appear another wonderful <w>develop
<lb break="no"/>-ment</w> of this Providence who is wonderful in counsel
<lb/>&amp; excellent in working. In every district of the country <!-- end of pencil line in left margin -->
<lb/>the process tends the same way － We "poor renegades from
<lb/>the anvil and loom" long insisted that the <orgName>Hottentots</orgName> had
<lb/>souls and our statements were looked upon as the blarney
<lb/>of silly enthusiasm, A few hundred of them however
<lb/>take it into their <term type="animal">monkey</term> heads to rebel and they actually
<lb/>kick the <foreign xml:lang="und">ossa coccyges</foreign> of our <term type="occupation">dragoons</term> and <term type="occupation"><unclear cert="low">minié</unclear>
<lb/>rifle men</term> － No wonder that great was the wrath
<lb/>of the <orgName><orgName><choice><abbr>Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi></abbr><expan>Government</expan></choice></orgName> <term type="occupation">Officials</term></orgName> － <orgName>Hottentot</orgName> rebellion! what next. We may
<lb/>expect our <term type="animal">cats</term> to have a strike "<choice><abbr>cause</abbr><expan>because</expan></choice> missus <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> give
<lb/>us the silver forks to eat with" － If we had hinted at a
<lb/><orgName>Hottentot</orgName> rebellion I believe they would have believed
<lb/>that a <term type="animal">cow</term> could handle a musket as well as they － The
<lb/>Rebellion is however a great fact and the <w>con-

<lb break="no"/>demnation</w> of <persName>Botha</persName> has sown seed which will yet vegetate
<lb/>But I am away from my <unclear cert="medium">text</unclear> － Everywhere there is a strong
<lb/>feeling of <choice><sic>independance</sic><corr>independence</corr></choice> springing up － The <term type="people">English</term> as a nation
<lb/>have lost character &amp; honour － the destruction of my property
<lb/>is a fortunate thing for me. there is not a <orgName>native</orgName> in the country 
<lb/>but knows now for certain on whose side I am. The <orgName>Boers</orgName>
<lb/>in plundering my house often expressed great regret that they
<lb/>had not got a hold of me. But we shall yet catch him said
<lb/>they. How good God's Providence is to me. I was detained in 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> till I quite fretted and then again in the way up －
<lb/>But now I can plainly see that had I got my own
<lb/>way I should have been in the very thick of the fight for
<lb/>I always intended to spend a fortnight or so with the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/>I grieve over the losses they have sustained but there is another
<lb/>point of view in which the matter may considered. the majority
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> have heard the <bibl>gospel</bibl> repeatedly but have not
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> it. They treated me uniformly with respect but when
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> professed faith in <persName>Christ</persName> they persecuted him bitterly － the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> have not only long refused to listen even but treated <persName> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName>
<lb/>with great disrespect － Nearly £1000 has been spent on them in vain
<lb/>indeed their p<add place="above">r</add>ofessed principles were to get all out of the <term type="occupation">missionary</term>
<lb/>they could but never <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> his message － the same may be
<lb/>said of the <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> and although the two stations are broken up
<lb/>it is no cause for sorrow. The <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> I am informed
<lb/>attended both school &amp; church better after I left for the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> than
<lb/>for a long time previously － average of the school 80. <persName>Sechele</persName>'s
<lb/>children are out here living with <persName>Mr<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Moffat</persName> they are well behaved
<lb/>the son resembles his father in manners. They give much less
<lb/>trouble than was expected － I think the seed sown will yet spring 
<lb/>up among the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> though I may not live to see it － I am 
<lb/>at present prevented from leaving for my own country by
<lb/>two <orgName>parties of <orgName>Boers</orgName></orgName> who are now in the <placeName><region>North</region></placeName> and are
<lb/>to be cut off. If I attempted to serve them they would very
<lb/>probably rob me in return, so must stand their chance
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> sends a message to me to wait a little yet so though
<lb/>it is trying to wait when free &amp; all ready for work, I must
<lb/>submit － I have just been driven away from <bibl>my writing</bibl>

<lb/>by the <term type="occupation">chief</term> <persName>Mahura</persName> － he is here on a visit － a great rogue
<lb/>he made a remark worth noting- "<persName>Sebube</persName> and <persName>Paul</persName> and you were
<lb/>taken out of the way of being killed - If either of you had been there
<lb/>you would certainly have been in the midst of the affair &amp; been killed
<lb/>God helped you by sending you out of the way" <persName>Sebube</persName> and <persName>Paul</persName>
<lb/>are gone north. <persName>Sebube</persName> is a very brave fellow － <orgName>Native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teacher</term>
<lb/>to the <term type="tribe">Wanketse</term> － He has lost all, though <persName>Mahura</persName> is a <orgName>heathen</orgName>
<lb/>he has imbibed some <term type="faith">Christian</term> knowledge － I have been thinking
<lb/>that I might draw £12 for <persName>Mebaloe</persName> － I have drawn nothing
<lb/>for some time for either him or <persName>Paul</persName>, our operations have 
<lb/>been interrupted － but as it is a matter of business I shall
<lb/>write you if I do. No word from my better half yet</p>
