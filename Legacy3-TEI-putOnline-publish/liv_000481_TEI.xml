<lb/>&amp; no <unclear cert="low">dominating</unclear> spirit was ever manifested during the period 
<lb/>of my residence under their roof - Everything in their power 
<lb/>was done to oblige us &amp; this is their character from all 
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> whose word is worth anything - Although 
<lb/>I did not receive a letter direct from <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> by port. I was 
<lb/>most agreeably surprised after landing here when I for 
<lb/>the first time opened the box you kindly presented me on 
<lb/>leaving, &amp; found a letter with a such a lot of valuable articles 
<lb/>it brought me right home again - All the articles are very 
<lb/>excellent &amp; some very opportunely. I had no workbox 
<lb/>nor slate nor table cloth but what did you mean by 
<lb/>the paper pens wax &amp;c? Was this a sly hint not to 
<lb/>forget writing? - You need not have done that for I shall 
<lb/>always consider it a privilege when my other duties will 
<lb/>allow - I have <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> you proof of this by writing you 
<lb/>even in this short space of time more frequently than 
<lb/>any other except my parents - However you perhaps

<lb/>her husband &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> E. Williams</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="town">Hankey</settlement></placeName> I made my first essay

<lb/>many associations to my mind, talking of things &amp; persons we 
<lb/>both knew and in the Scotch language - Amongst the wild 
<lb/>mountain scenery she sung some songs - in the genuine accent 
<lb/>while at some parts unearthly ones were uttered by ugly labour
<lb/>in the rocks above, in derision, I suppose, of <del type="cancelled">the</del> cries of our 
<lb/>people to the <term type="animal">oxen</term> &amp; many other things too trivial to mention 
<lb/>gave our trip a sufficient degree of novelty to render it very <gap agent="illegible" unit="chars" extent="8"/>
<lb/>interesting to ourselves - I enjoyed my first attempt very much 
<lb/>felt very little of that strangeness which I expected to feel in it 
<lb/>We were all willing to please &amp; <add place="inline">˄</add><add place="above">be</add> pleased. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Williams</persName> is a most

<lb/>has been obliged  <del type="cancelled">from</del> by an affection of his throat to leave his 
<lb/>charge for the season &amp; retire to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> - A sea voyage being 
<lb/>recommended he came round to <placeName><region>Algoa Bay</region></placeName> &amp; feeling much 
<lb/>better resolved to visit his people - <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he affection <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> him 
<lb/>by the latter was most interesting, I had no idea that the 
<lb/><orgName>Hottentots</orgName> were so far advanced as I find them - As we approached 
<lb/>the romantic but unhealthily situated spot where the village stands 
<lb/>a discharge of musketry from the first houses made the inhabitants 
<lb/>aware of our approach - <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his was answered by some discharge 
<lb/>from the opposite side &amp; immediately men women &amp; children 
<lb/>young &amp; old were seen running from all quarters to the path 
<lb/>winds down into the valley where the village is situated 
<lb/>Joy beamed in every face as each pressed forward to grasp the 
<lb/>hand of him whom it was easy to perceive they esteemed a beloved 
<lb/>friend - It was not however a boisterous joy - It was chastened 
<lb/>&amp; sober - a hymn was started by the women &amp; their beautiful 
<lb/>clear voices resounded through the whole valley as the waggon 
<lb/>approached nearer the houses - <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he expression of gladness 
<lb/>might have been more disorderly - more like what we should 
<lb/>expect from a people lately rescued from comparative <unclear cert="low">barbarity</unclear><!-- unable to proofread this line due to strong shadow on the image, ks -->

<lb/>but <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>Williams</expan></choice></persName> since he parted with them had lost a fine little boy by

<lb/>the men had each a little bit of crepe around their hats &amp; the women 
<lb/>black handkerchief round the head - It was affecting to see one 
<lb/>poor woman who had nursed his boy come forward to shake 
<lb/>hands, her breast heaving with emotion - burst into tears &amp; turn 
<lb/>away from the crowd to weep - As soon as <add place="inline">˄</add><add place="above">the women had to bake</add> possible after our 
<lb/>arrival, the people invited us to an entertainment. <term type="plant_foodstuff">Coffee</term> in the 
<lb/>morning &amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff">tea</term> in the afternoon - Several speeches were made 
<lb/>which seemed eloquent. The purport of them was telling us how

<lb/><p>You kindly offered to do any little thing for me I might forget, I shall

<lb/>I am sorry I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice>, but they will I daresay wait with patience till

<lb/>them through the winter &amp; make them feel that though far <w>sepera<supplied>-</supplied>	
<lb break="no"/>ted</w> I am not unmindful of their comfort - I have written 
<lb/>them about it. Will <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pyne</persName> kindly draw it at the Mission House 
<lb/>&amp; transmit it to them - <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Phillip</persName> will draw out a bill in

<lb/>why I send home money so early. It will be endorsed with

<lb/>another request viz. Tell my Dear Brother <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moore</persName> if he has plenty
