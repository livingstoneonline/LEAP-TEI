<lb/>Also a short note for yourself. There

<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="village">Pungo Andongo</settlement></placeName> but it being very
<lb/>difficult if not impossible to get
<lb/>a piece in which all the rocks are

<lb/>as would convey to you an idea
<lb/>of the great masses of conglomerate
<lb/>which form the famous <placeName>Pedras</placeName> <!-- Is this a mountain of some sort, or other geogName? HB -->
<lb/>There are different kinds of porphyries<!-- Fixed. EM -->
<lb/>also gneiss, granite syemite or <!-- Changed unclear greiss to gneiss, as that is a form of rock we've encountered in other transcriptions. HB -->

<lb/>in the specimens. Indeed to look at the rocks
<lb/>they resemble gigantic bauks of shingle <!-- Not sure what bauks is here, as I found definitions of both Serbian and Scottish origin, neither seeming to really fit this case? HB -->
<lb/>stuck in a matrix hard bluish pale
<lb/>red sandstone - such bauks are seen <!-- Again, bauks, and is this six not suck? HB -->
<lb/>near <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> but only 2 <choice><abbr>yds</abbr><expan>yards</expan></choice> thick
<lb/>Here they are about 300 or 400 feet in

<lb/>has only a few pebbles in it these
<lb/>gradually become smaller as we go

<lb/>You must come and geologize yourself
<lb/>I intended to examine the iron said

<lb/>now that this is near the end of it
<lb/>It is doubtful whether we shall meet
<lb/>again in this world - But I pray to <!-- Aw, sentimental DL!! HB -->
<lb/>our Heavenly Father that we may
<lb/>meet in joy before him in a better
<lb/>land. I remember promising to tell
<lb/>how I might do in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> if by
<lb/><choice><sic>Gods</sic><corr>God's</corr></choice> good providence I should reach it
<lb/>The country explored is unfit for a
<lb/><orgName>European</orgName> family - I might live and
<lb/>do good in it but it would be
<lb/>subjecting those whom God has
<lb/>committed to my care to an extended

<lb/>be obtained <del type="strikethrough">might</del> accept of it. But
<lb/>it would be with a pang and on <w>thei<supplied>r</supplied></w>
<lb/>account alone. (He that careth not for

<lb/>I always since I knew the value of

<lb/>I have the same desire now undiminished
<lb/>but to leave my family to the tender
<lb/>mercies of a charitable institution. Some
<lb/>of the members of which have a sort of spite
<lb/>at my success in exploration, seems hard
<lb/>I can only hope that He who has helped
