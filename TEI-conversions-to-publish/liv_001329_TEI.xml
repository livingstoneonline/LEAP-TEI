<lb/><p rend="right">Ma Robert, <placeName>Zambesi</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">21<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> June 1858 </p>
<lb/><p><persName>John Laird Esq<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">re</hi></hi></persName></p>
<lb/><p>My dear Sir,</p>
<lb/><p>As you will no doubt feel 
<lb/>anxious to hear how we get on with the 
<lb/>Launch I am happy to be able to inform 
<lb/>you that we entered what has been called 
<lb/>the <placeName>West Luabo</placeName> (properly <placeName>Luave</placeName>) on the 13<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi>
<lb/>of May and finding a fine, safe harbour 
<lb/>we proceeded at once to take out the three 
<lb/>compartments of the Ma Robert from the Pearl. 
<lb/>The first day was sufficient for getting her 
<lb/>into the water and putting her together 
<lb/>by the admirable and simple contrivance your 
<lb/>son invented.  We had only to stand on a 
<lb/>compartment in sufficient numbers to sink it 
<lb/>down and drawing it to the middle section, 
<lb/>the bolts slipped in with the greatest ease - on 
<lb/>the evening of the third day, she was ready 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">to</fw>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001329_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>to act as Pilot to the larger vessel and has 
<lb/>been doing admirable service ever since - She 
<lb/>goes puffing away on this great <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>now, to the infinite disgust of the Hippopotami 
<lb/>whole herds of which rush off pell mell as 
<lb/>soon as we approach them, and the crustiest 
<lb/>old Bachelor among them, dares not to do her 
<lb/>battle. </p>
<lb/><p>It would be an immense boon if 
<lb/>the Government would send out such Vessels 
<lb/>to run up Creeks and rivers and chase Slavers 
<lb/>instead of taking it out on the poor Sailors 
<lb/>muscles at the oars - but you would require 
<lb/>to make them broader than this, and not 
<lb/>quite as long - the length might be borne 
<lb/>with if they were four or feet broader 
<lb/>and no objection could be taken to this as the 
<lb/>Men of War could carry them with ease between 
<lb/>masts. Allow me also to suggest as an 
<lb/>improvement two plates near the bottom 
<lb/>of each compartment with plugs which when 
<lb/>the compartments were once put together 
<lb/>might be taken out and both inserted, I 
<lb/><figure><graphic style="display:inline float:left" url="LETT875-1.png"/></figure> mention this because our after 
<lb/>compartment shews some symptoms 
<lb/>of the bottom bolts or dowels becoming 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">loose</fw>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001329_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>loose I venture also to suggest the greater 
<lb/>width as we can<reg>'</reg>t carry luggage at present,
<lb/>and four feet additional with perhaps a little 
<lb/>more power would make her perfect. She 
<lb/>has done exceedingly well and tows a large 
<lb/>launch far better than we expected. Now 
<lb/>as I am done with criticism which you 
<lb/>may think sufficiently presumptuous I 
<lb/>beg to be most kindly remembered to <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> L</persName> and all your family. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> L</persName> was obliged to leave me at 
<lb/>the Cape and go with her Parents to <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/>
<lb/>We hope to meet again after 
<lb/>her confinement. We are all in good health<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Pearl leaves us with this<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p rend="center"><persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Our bolts shew signs of decay - altho' 
<lb/>ashamed to say more I must add make 
<lb/>the plates 1/8 they bend so underfoot. </p>
<lb/><p>A sketch of our getting the Launch out 
<lb/>is sent at this time to the Foreign Office. </p>
