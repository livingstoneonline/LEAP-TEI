<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Sesheke</placeName> 12 September 1860 </p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>In three months we 
<lb/>marched on foot from <placeName>Tette</placeName> to this, 
<lb/>a distance by the route we travelled along 
<lb/>the North bank of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> of 600 
<lb/>miles at least. We crossed the mountains 
<lb/>in which <placeName>Morumbua</placeName> lies, then the 
<lb/><placeName>Loangua</placeName> and <placeName>Kafue</placeName> at their confluences 
<lb/>and proceeded along the fine fertile 
<lb/>densely peopled valley in which the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> gently flows till we came 
<lb/>to º17 18′ South. People very friendly 
<lb/>and hospitable though the men 
<lb/>go stark naked. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he numbers of 
<lb/>elephants<reg>,</reg> buffaloes &amp; Hippopotami 
<lb/>prodigious and the whole country a 
<lb/>coal field broken through at parts 
<lb/>by igneous rocks. Here we turned 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001582_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>westward and soon gained an altitude of 
<lb/>3000 feet above the sea or 2000 feet 
<lb/>above the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> - Near <placeName>Tabachen</placeName>
<lb/>we had hoar frost and a little ice 
<lb/>and after breathing for a short time 
<lb/>to clear cold air of the high plateau we 
<lb/>descended to the West intending to make 
<lb/>a pretty straight course to <placeName>Sesheke</placeName>
<lb/>but at 20′ of latitude we saw the columns 
<lb/>of smoke and I could not resist the 
<lb/>temptation to shew the wonderful scene 
<lb/>to my companions <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName> and <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C 
<lb/>Livingstone</persName> though it added some 40 
<lb/>miles to our tramp - the water was 
<lb/>very much lower than when I was 
<lb/>there in 1855. Indeed people employed 
<lb/>to build a stockade to protect my 
<lb/>seeds on <placeName>garden island</placeName> waded across 
<lb/>from the North bank. Between 
<lb/>ourselves my brother who is familiar 
<lb/>with <placeName>Niagara</placeName> declares that <placeName>Victoria 
<lb/>Falls</placeName> throw the American into the 
<lb/>
shade. <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName> declares none but 
<lb/>a painter in oil could give an idea 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001582_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>of the scene - And this is when one half 
<lb/>is nearly dry and but two good 
<lb/>columns shew. I think that I have 
<lb/>overstated nothing but the columns as 
<lb/>to height and I cannot measure them<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We shall measure accurately all we 
<lb/>can as we return, in the mean 
<lb/>time a stone requires 5 seconds to 
<lb/>reach the bottom. A gentleman from <placeName>Natal</placeName> called this 200! yards! I 
<lb/>cannot refer to Cooley's fancy 
<lb/>that the <placeName>Liambai</placeName> runs under 
<lb/>the <placeName>Kalahari desert</placeName> and is lost in a 
<lb/>serious manner. Pity we cannot 
<lb/>get rid of London sewage as easily 
<lb/>as he can get rid of a river 300 
<lb/>or 400 yards wide above the <placeName>Kafue</placeName> and the most navigable part of 
<lb/>the whole <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. </p>
<lb/><p>We went on to <add place="above"><placeName>Sekeltu</placeName>at</add> Sesheke and 
<lb/>found him labouring under a skin 
<lb/>disease believed by his people to be 
<lb/>leprosy - several suffered death 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001582_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>for the crime of having inflicted the disease 
<lb/>by witchcraft. He was gratified by 
<lb/>our treatment though not knowing 
<lb/>the disease exactly we could not 
<lb/>speak positively about it. We used 
<lb/>the medicines we had and I went 
<lb/>over to <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> on horse back 
<lb/>to search for others in my waggon<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He regained spirits and was recovering 
<lb/>when we left. We have kept faith 
<lb/>with him and his people. The Arab party 
<lb/>that went to <del type="strikethrough"><placeName>Linyanti</placeName></del><placeName>Loanda</placeName> consisting 
<lb/>of 95 persons never returned. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>may have been wheedled over to the 
<lb/>East coast on a promise of getting 
<lb/>horses - overpowered &amp; sold as 
<lb/>French emigrants. </p>
<lb/><p>While at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> I saw the 
<lb/>graves of a party of English missionaries 
<lb/>who had perished after some three 
<lb/>months in the country. I was very 
<lb/>much saddened by this - six out 
<lb/>of nine Europeans had been cut off<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001582_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'--> 
<lb/>At that very time we at a lower 
<lb/>and more unhealthy part of the 
<lb/>river cured the fever so quickly 
<lb/>that we were rarely detained more 
<lb/>than a day or two - A European 
<lb/>would be stricken down and 
<lb/>resume his march on foot a 
<lb/>day after the operation of a remedy 
<lb/>which I first employed in curing 
<lb/>my own children and a party 
<lb/>of English (one of whom had died 
<lb/>before my arrival) at <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Ngami</placeName> in 1850. Four of the 
<lb/>native attendants on the mission 
<lb/>also perished - this sad case 
<lb/>makes me very anxious that 
<lb/>the remedy become widely known 
<lb/>and I have ventured to lay it formally 
<lb/>before <persName>Lord John Russell</persName> in the 
<lb/>belief that a saving of human life 
<lb/>may be effected - and if so it ought 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001582_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'--> 
<lb/>to be recorded that the discovery was 
<lb/>by a Government servant<reg>.</reg><persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>has the same opinion of its value 
<lb/>that I have and indeed it is the 
<lb/>experience of this Expedition that 
<lb/>gives me full confidence in it<reg>s</reg>
<lb/>usefulness for Europeans generally<reg>.</reg> It consists of common medicines 
<lb/>but used in a way some would 
<lb/>find fault with  without preliminary 
<lb/>measures - It is Resin of Jalap 
<lb/>eight grains calomel eight grains 
<lb/>Quinine and Rhubarb of each 4 grains. <add place="above">mix well &amp; keep in powder dose to 20 grs</add>. Then Quinine in four 
<lb/>grain doses completes the cure - the 
<lb/>most urgent symptoms are relieved 
<lb/>in from four to six hours. I have 
<lb/>never met a case in either white 
<lb/>or black that I did not cure if taken 
<lb/>in time but I have avoided saying 
<lb/>much about it as it would look like quackery. It has no bad effect on 
<lb/>the system for I have escaped any 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001582_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'--> 
<lb/>severe attack. I have had little illness 
<lb/>only probably from malaria but not 
<lb/>one regular fever since my return<reg>.</reg> We have tried combinations of other 
<lb/>purgatives but they have left the 
<lb/>conviction that anything else is 
<lb/>mere trifling. Warburg's Tincture 
<lb/>causes profuse sweating &amp; weakens<reg>.</reg> Ours cures without loss of strength 
<lb/>to the patient. You will understand 
<lb/>my earnestness now when I 
<lb/>mention that I found in my 
<lb/>waggon the proper medicines for 
<lb/>the composition of the remedy about 
<lb/>500 yds from the spot where these 
<lb/>missionaries died, and I have stated 
<lb/>its value in general terms towards 
<lb/>the end of "Missionary Travels"<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The Makololo are perishing 
<lb/>by fever and are very anxious to 
<lb/>remove to the <placeName>Highlands</placeName> but 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001582_0008"/><!--pb/@n='8'--> 
<lb/>dread removal to a defenceless site 
<lb/>without some member of <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Moffat<reg>'</reg>s</persName>
<lb/>family. A town is to be <choice><sic>sent</sic><corr>set</corr></choice> up this
<lb/>year by way of experiment on 
<lb/><persName>Mosilikatze<reg>'</reg>s</persName> cupidity. A son of <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>Moffat</persName> is <del type="strikethrough">there</del><add place="above">with Mosilikatze</add> and as influence 
<lb/>increases our post will work. 
<lb/>Several trading parties have been to the 
<lb/>West coast<reg>.</reg><persName>Sekeletu</persName> regaled us with 
<lb/>tea - American biscuits &amp; preserved 
<lb/>fruits every day when we call. He 
<lb/>is buying horses at 10 tusks per 
<lb/>beast, and sent to <placeName>Pungo Andongo</placeName>
<lb/>in <placeName>Angola</placeName> to buy a horse I had 
<lb/>ridden there. They are quite ready 
<lb/>to be vaccinated. A supply sent 
<lb/>lay long at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> together with my 
<lb/>despatches &amp; has lost its power. I beg you to secure us a fresh supply 
<lb/>by your mail so as to come as fresh 
<lb/>as possible - the Establishment is <placeName>8 
<lb/>Russell Place, Fitzroy Square</placeName>. Ever yours </p>
