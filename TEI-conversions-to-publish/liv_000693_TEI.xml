<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> February 1850</p>
<lb/><p>My Very Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p>We were favoured with N<hi rend="sup">os</hi> 21 &amp; 22 about a 
<lb/>week ago, the parcels in which they came we expect in about 
<lb/>a fortnight. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Publications had reached <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> in safety 
<lb/>and the messenger being on foot could bring no more than the 
<lb/>letters. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 22. shews that the Med. Rev. &amp; Eclectic &amp;c. are safe 
<lb/>up to May last. It is really marvellous that you do not <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice>
<lb/>my acknowledgements for I believe I write you oftener than 
<lb/>I do the <persName>Pynes</persName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he longest interval occurred when I was absent 
<lb/>at the Lake but I wrote a note before starting (about May) and 
<lb/>another as soon as I returned (about October) and I had it in 
<lb/>contemplation to write you now though no letter or parcel had 
<lb/>come. Be assured I have always written you without waiting 
<lb/>for an answer. But the idea that my pains are all in vain 
<lb/>is rather discouraging. I must inclose them to some of my 
<lb/>friends perhaps. Your good nature in continuing your kind 
<lb/>services in the teeth of my apparent ingratitude is certainly 
<lb/>wonderful.</p>
<lb/><p>We had a visit from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Freeman</persName>. He came a few days before 
<lb/>1849 fled and left a few days after /50 began. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he visit was most 
<lb/>agreeable. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he only causes for sorrow in connection with it were 
<lb/>its being so short, and our accommodation so poor. Ever 
<lb/>since I have had the idea strongly impressed on my mind that 
<lb/>a triennial deputation would lend much to the efficiency 
<lb/>of the mission and if <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tidman</persName> would come out the 
<lb/>journey I am sure would add ten years to his life. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his 
<lb/>is really a fine climate and a trip up here to breathe the 
<lb/>pure air of the Desert and infuse spirit into the forlorn 
<lb/>hope would certainly do your London ministers no 
<lb/>harm. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he perpetual hurry scurry in which they move 
<lb/>might make them glad of a little desert calm<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he object <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F.</persName> had in view was to reduce the expenditure of the 
<lb/>Society in Africa from £9000 to £4000. But he has I am sorry 
<lb/>to say fallen in completely with the views of the <persName>Rev D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Philip</persName> in 
<lb/>reference to the necessity of keeping up the colonial stations<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hose who hold the opposite views maintain that the colonial 
<lb/>missions having fulfilled their object in affording protection 
<lb/>to the coloured population till their liberty and instruction have 
<lb/>been <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/><add place="above"><unclear cert="high">guaranteed</unclear></add> by the Gov<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">t</hi></hi> ought now to be abandoned &amp; 
<lb/>more of the funds appropriated to the real missionary field in 
<lb/>the regions beyond. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he reduction in expenditure ought to be 
<lb/>effected thus. But the worthy D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> maintains that if the stations 
<lb/>were abandoned the Hottentots would sink again into their 
<lb/>former state. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is giving small credit to the conservative 
<lb/>influence of the truth which has been furnished them without 
<lb/>money and price for more than 30 years. Another argument 
<lb/>runs thus. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he London M.S. is the only society that does 
<lb/>look to the Blacks. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Dutch Reformed (parish ministers) 
<lb/>and Wesleyan missionaries attend exclusively to the whites<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>If we abandon them no one will care for their souls. But 
<lb/>then the Dutch Ref. &amp; Wesleyans make the fact of our 
<w>attend-<lb break="no"/>ing</w> to the coloured population their excuse for following the 
<lb/>do nothing line. We are a salve to their consciences - the 
<lb/>Hottentots promise great things to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Freeman</persName> but then 
<lb/>hear what "great things" are in their estimation. It only 
<w>am-<lb break="no"/>ounts</w> to raising by great effort £100 for their missionaries 
<lb/>during the current year. Bare justice would in the opinion 
<lb/>of many be £100 for the missionary they detain from 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>ceeding</w> to the Heathen - and the outfit &amp; salary of another in 
<lb/>his stead. If the Hottentots after being christianized for 20 
<lb/>years are to have a regular supply of pastors from Europe 
<lb/>for ever &amp; aye<reg>.</reg> Bless the fellows, they are better off than we 
<lb/>are in England. I say christianized for when a decided 
<lb/>majority in a village are professing christians they deserve 
<lb/>the appellation, and such has been the case in several 
<lb/>cases for more than 20 years. If they do not now 
<lb/>support the gospel among themselves I don<reg>'</reg>t see at what 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000693_0003"/><!--pb/@n='11r'-->
<lb/>period the society should slip out from being a sort of go-cart 
<lb/>to them. Perpetual tutelage &amp; everlasting leading strings would enfeeble 
<lb/>angels. You folks in England talk very knowingly about 
<lb/>"concentration" that maybe is philosophy but it is gammon 
<lb/>in relation to Africa. Concentrate in India or China 
<lb/>where you have an immense population but not in Africa<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he little experience I have had leads me to believe that concentration 
<lb/>is not the thing for Africa. We cannot force the thing 
<lb/>as gardeners do plants. By the above you will have 
<lb/>a birds eye view of the question which agitates our mission
<lb/>ary <unclear cert="medium">horizon</unclear> at present. Many thanks for the parcels 
<lb/>and all the news your letters contain. A fine set of 
<lb/>people you Europeans are become, shooting each 
<lb/>other as the people here do Rhinoceros and you don<reg>'</reg>t eat 
<lb/>each other either. You will get to that too bye &amp; bye. Soup 
<lb/>Kitchens will start up behind the Barricades<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brown</persName> is a long way from us. It is not likely I shall 
<lb/>ever see him. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is I am sorry to say but little doing <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/><supplied reason="damage">in</supplied>
<lb/>the missionary field here. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>uccessive years of scarcity 
<lb/>have proved a great hindrance to us in this tribe. We have 
<lb/>however by the Divine goodness the prospect of a harvest 
<lb/>in <choice><reg>M</reg><orig>m</orig></choice>ay next and then we hope that the attendance of the 
<lb/>people will be more regular. I am much delighted with 
<lb/>the new field beyond. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Boers will not allow us 
<lb/>to labour among the tribes East of this<reg>.</reg> I greatly desire 
<lb/>to be allowed to reduce the new language to writing 
<lb/>and translate God's word into it though after that I shall 
<lb/>be like a sucked orange &amp; not worth burial. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here 
<lb/>are however 600 miles additional land carriage. 270 
<lb/>already beyond <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> makes an impression on the 
<lb/>salary sufficient to induce us to look unutterable things 
<lb/>at the other 600. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>n epidemic frequently fatal. Great
