<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kongone</placeName> 17<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> March</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1862</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Captain Wilson</persName> returned to 
<lb/><placeName>Shupanga</placeName> on the Evening 
<lb/>of the 14<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> bringing the 
<lb/>sad news that the bishop 
<lb/>and <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Burrup</persName> are 
<lb/>dead. A new route from 
<lb/><placeName>Ruo</placeName> to the Mission station 
<lb/>was found necessary as 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> could not 
<lb/>well go up to <persName>Chibisa's</persName>
<lb/>the bishop wished to come 
<lb/>down in Nov<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> &amp; explore 
<lb/>from <placeName>Ruo</placeName> upwards 
<lb/>but continual rains induced 
<lb/>me to object very strongly 
<lb/>to his going as he would 
<lb/>certainly have been knocked 
<lb/>up &amp; he had only one man

<lb/>with him - <del type="strikethrough">subsequently he</del>
<lb/>It was well he yielded for 
<lb/>we were detained 6 weeks 
<lb/>with a marsh on each side 
<lb/>of us long before we came 
<lb/>to the <placeName>Ruo</placeName>. Subsequently he 
<lb/>sent <persName>Scudamore</persName> &amp; <persName>Procter</persName>
<lb/>to explore and they went away 
<lb/>Eastwards to the <placeName>Melanje 
<lb/>mountains</placeName> instead of 
<w>South-<lb break="no"/>wards</w> as I directed. I told 
<lb/>the bishop that <placeName>Mount 
<lb/>Clarendon</placeName> must be kept 
<lb/>well on his left but 
<lb/>they must have had it on 
<lb/>their right. A chief attacked 
<lb/>and plundered them and 
<lb/>the bishop called some 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makalolo</term> who remained 
<lb/>at <persName>Chibisa's</persName> instead of going 
<lb/>home as I directed them 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001753_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>went &amp; attacked the plundering 
<lb/>chief &amp; burned his village 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> took away 
<lb/>his goats. Afraid to go further 
<lb/>among that tribe (he was at 
<lb/>the source of the <placeName>Ruo</placeName>) he 
<lb/>returned &amp; with <persName>Burrup</persName>
<lb/>came down <placeName>Shire</placeName> to 
<lb/>meet his sister &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> Burrup</persName>
<lb/>who were coming up in 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> - canoe was 
<lb/>overturned we suppose 
<lb/>in an eddy - bedding &amp; 
<lb/>medicine <add place="above">tea coffee &amp;c &amp;c</add> lost - came on 
<lb/><add place="inline">in wet clothes &amp; devoured by myriad of mosquitoes</add> to <placeName>Ruo</placeName> a fortnight after 
<lb/>the time appointed. We 
<lb/>looked out 
<lb/>for them two 
<lb/>days a mile above <placeName>Ruo</placeName>
<lb/>and enquired among the 
<lb/>natives but no word of 
<lb/>them so we passed <placeName>Ruo</placeName>
<lb/>on the day they ought to have 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001753_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>been there - but to resume 
<lb/>the narrative - after the 
<lb/>canoe accident they came 
<lb/>to the <placeName>Ruo</placeName> - were kindly treated 
<lb/>but fever attacked the bishop 
<lb/>and without treatment or 
<lb/>medicine died. He left his 
<lb/>station with diarrhoea - &amp; it 
<lb/>never left him. <persName>Burrup</persName> too 
<lb/>labouring under diarrhoea 
<lb/>returned to the mission &amp; 
<lb/>died - they have had much 
<lb/>diarrhoea &amp; dysentery among 
<lb/>their people 20 or 30 of the 
<lb/>children have died. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>bishop is a great loss - &amp; 
<lb/>I fear the effect in England 
<lb/>will be sorely against us 
<lb/>all. <persName>Burrup</persName> &amp; he were the 
<lb/>strongest of the party and 
<lb/>neither could believe that 
<lb/>aught would hurt them 
<lb/>the bishop wrote in a letter 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001753_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'-->
<lb/>to the Cape that the "Pills were 
<lb/>worse that the disease". In this joke we see that he 
<lb/>thought little of it, and we now 
<lb/>mourne his loss in 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>sequence.</w> All loved him 
<lb/>he was very amiable, 
<lb/>too much so I fear to be 
<lb/>a leader of men as we 
<lb/>find them. A new head must be sent out at once 
<lb/>or the mission will break 
<lb/>up. There are differences 
<lb/>among the missionaries 
<lb/>which I will not conceal 
<lb/>from you, which can 
<lb/>be dealt with only by 
<lb/>an authoritative head. 
<lb/>There is no one to fill a

<lb/>romance of the thing has 
<lb/>passed away and hard 
<lb/>prosaic work does not go 
<lb/>down nearly so well. Indeed 
<lb/>some seem to have come 
<lb/>out merely to make a good 
<lb/>thing of it by book writing<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/>now that it is known 
<lb/>we are in want we must 
<lb/>pay enormously for every 
<lb/>thing. £1. per sheep for 
<lb/>instance the regular price

<lb/><p>We take 2 mules from

<lb/>have no tsetse except at

<lb/>said "No <placeName>Cape Delgado</placeName> is our

<lb/>frustrated he made a commercial 
<lb/>treaty &amp; returned to <placeName> Mosambique</placeName>. 
<lb/><placeName>Rovuma</placeName> is therefore ours. 
<lb/>I have asked the Foreign Office 
<lb/>if possession ought to be 
<lb/>taken in name of Her Majesty 
<lb/>of our discoveries. Can you 
<lb/>do anything by way of 
<lb/>clenching the boundary to
