XML (Cummings)

I have a quick XSLT question. If I have something like the following:

<metamark function="flag" spanTo="#meta-2"/>some longest piece of text, say spanning several lines or a page or two even<anchor xml:id="meta-2"/>

would this be able to be rendered so that the enclosed text was put in square brackets or something like that. In other words, would enclosing the text in something be feasible from an XSLT perspective given that this is a metamark that points to an anchor with a specific xml:id?
