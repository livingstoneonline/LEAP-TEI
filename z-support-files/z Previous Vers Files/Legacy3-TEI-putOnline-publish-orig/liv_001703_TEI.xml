<lb/><p><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand01">My Dear Friend</del></p>
<lb/><p><del>I believe I wrote to you 
<lb/>on the arrival of the Pioneer about the 
<lb/>beginning of this year thanking you 
<lb/>for your very kind remembrance 
<lb/>of me in sending all the Society's 
<w>publica-<lb break="no"/>tions</w> - Some of the French journals 
<lb/>and a kind note besides. I had begun 
<lb/>to despair, and thought you had forgotten 
<lb/>me but the appearance of these things 
<lb/>made me both ashamed &amp; thankful. 
<lb/>That old heathen <persName>Arrowsmith</persName> never 
<lb/>once wrote to me - though I twice wrote 
<lb/>to him. May he live till long after 
<lb/>I come home that I may punish 
<lb/>him for his negligence<reg>.</reg></del></p>
<lb/><p>We have been up to <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName>
<lb/>and carried a boat passed the cataracts 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001703_0002"/><!--pb/@n='53v'--> 
<lb/>to explore by. Went along the Western 
<lb/>shore but a paper I have written for 
<lb/>the Society and send through <persName>Lord John 
<lb/>Russell</persName> will give you all particulars<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is very deep - from 20 to 50 or 60 
<lb/>miles broad and over 200 miles long 
<lb/>(225) - It was excessively stormy and 
<lb/>you must not despise us for failing 
<lb/>to find out all about the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>. 
<lb/>We were on the West side and could not 
<lb/>cross in a little open boat at the period 
<lb/>of the Equinoctial gales - then we could 
<lb/>get no food in a depopulated part of 
<lb/>the country near the North end. Pirates 
<lb/>live on detached rocks - and human 
<lb/>skeletons &amp; putrid bodies <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand01">(exactly like 
<lb/>the old dissecting room odour)</del> were 
<lb/>lying everywhere. It was like a fair dead 
<lb/>lock for us and we came back 
<lb/><del>intending to bend all our energies 
<w>to-<lb break="no"/>wards</w> placing a steamer on the 
<lb/>Lake - this will take a year at least<reg>.</reg></del>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001703_0003"/><!--pb/@n='54r'--> 
<lb/>Another Lake called <placeName>Moelo</placeName> was reported 
<lb/>by two Arabs we met on the Lake 
<lb/>they came from a place called 
<lb/><placeName>Katanga</placeName> which seems to be S.S.W of 
<lb/><placeName>Cazembe</placeName> - they had come down to 
<lb/>buy cloth at <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand01">When we 
<lb/>have the steamer up we shall be 
<lb/>able to examine to country adjacent 
<lb/>with Ease. </del></p>
<lb/><p><del>I shall enclose a sketch of the Lake 
<lb/>that if you think proper <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> George</persName>
<lb/>may make an enlarged one for 
<lb/>exhibition supposing you again 
<lb/>favour my paper with a reading. 
<lb/>The Latitudes are all correct and 
<lb/>the longitudes pretty nearly so 
<lb/>if we take as a basis <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Maclear's</persName>
<lb/>determination of my former 
<lb/>observations at the Lake - the first 
<lb/>observation is 2′ up the Lake and 
<lb/>about 1′ west of our former 
<w>observ-<lb break="no"/>ations</w>

<lb/><p><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand01">What do you think of your Yankee 
<lb/>friends now? I am very sorry 
<lb/>to hear of the break up. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey were 
<lb/>such a glorious standing protest 
<lb/>against old world tyranny, 
<lb/>but by their horrid slave system 
<lb/>sent all to the dogs - One hopes, 
<lb/>though we can't see how it may 
<lb/>yet all be settled amicably. </del></p>
<lb/><p><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand01">I should have been glad to be 
<lb/>with you when <persName>Du Chaillu</persName> has his 
<lb/>night, but I must get a pathway 
<lb/>out of this region away from the 
<lb/>Portuguese before I can leave. 
<lb/>In the meantime I wish you
