<lb/>and though conscious of many imperfections
<lb/>not a single pang of regret arises in the

<lb/>was as his name implies a weakling - I was <w>accom<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-panied</w> by a much older man than myself and he
<lb/>advised caution &amp; reserve as to our objects - I listened
<lb/>to the voice of age &amp; we made no efforts to teach in a
<lb/>formal way - Messages had however been sent from
<lb/><term type="occupation">chieftains</term> further south explaining our objects
<lb/>and that our mode of procedure would be <unclear cert="high">pretending</unclear>
<lb/>liberality of sentiments which meant hiding our

<lb/>to your power &amp; <term type="occupation">chieftainship</term> - We were to be closely
<lb/>watched and any one <choice><orig>shewing</orig><reg>showing</reg></choice> an inclination to
<lb/><choice><sic>to</sic><corr/></choice> harm was to be prevented - My associate soon
<lb/>put his foot into his own system for having obtained

<lb/>the <term type="occupation">spy</term> proceeded at once to utter all that had

<lb/>a full meeting of the principal men - so long as I
<lb/>was busy building a comfortable house and

<lb/>feeling that every day I was doing real <w>mission<supplied>-</supplied>

<lb/>lost all control of his tongue &amp; pronounced
<lb/>him to be a fool in words which he had a

<lb/>forbade man woman or child to <choice><sic>to</sic><corr/></choice> go near
<lb/>the school or have anything to do with the <term type="occupation">teacher</term>
<lb/>and this prohibition lasted with rigour for eight
<lb/>years - The mission spent all the little zeal it
<lb/>had on a few <orgName>emigrants from <placeName><settlement type="village" ref="settlement.xml#sett0007">Kuruman</settlement></placeName></orgName>
<lb/>who already <term type="faith"><choice><sic>christianized</sic><corr>Christianized</corr></choice></term> came to enjoy better
