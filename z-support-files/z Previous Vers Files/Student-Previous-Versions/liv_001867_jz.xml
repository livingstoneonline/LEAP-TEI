<lb/><p><!-- variant reading "we"-->Ive enclosed letter
<lb/>for <persName>Ms Mackenzie</persName> I should like you
<lb/>to read it as it will give you my views
<lb/>and mind about renewing the mission
<lb/>to the <placeName>Makololo</placeName> - I mention that I have
<lb/>requested you to do so to save writing
<lb/>the same thing over again - We are 
<lb/>ready to go up Shire and the mail is
<lb/>to start for Luillianance <!-- unclear word --> -</p>
<p>
I enclose a photograph by D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Yurk of the resting place of my dear
<lb/><persName>Mary</persName> - we have not the proper
<lb/>burials to make it back - I placed
<lb/>a <unclear cert="low">cron</unclear> over her tomb a sacred
<lb/>symbol in these regions and
<lb/>have sent for a grave stone with
<lb/>the inscription on one side English
<lb/>and on the other Portuguese "Here
<lb/>repose the mortal remains of
<lb/>Mary Moffat Livingston in hope
<lb/>of a joyful resurrection by our
<lb/>Saviour Jesus Christ - died
<lb/>27<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> April 1862 aged 61 years -" 
<lb/>this has been a spot of much
<lb/>sorrow to me Well do I remember
<lb/>No feelings with which iI looked at

<lb/>the red <unclear cert="low">ruled</unclear> writing in which she died when
<lb/>I sailed down the <unclear cert="low">bread</unclear> river in 1856
<lb/>Possibly at some other spt which I have
<lb/>already passed I must lie down &amp; die -
<lb/>she would welcome Robert and I hope
<lb/>will come forward &amp; greet more of us 
<lb/>into the house of many mansions
<lb/>However now we must be up and
<lb/>doing our duty - we have been detained 
<lb/>here a full <unclear cert="low">footnight</unclear> shifting to top
<lb/>to the bottom <unclear cert="low">braves</unclear> of the paddle shafts
<lb/>We met M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Prorter the head of
<lb/>the church mission - He has implored
<lb/>wonderfully - was thankful for the
<lb/>Alphabet you send - He means to 
<lb/>cut out x and put in z which they
<lb/>have in their tongue - they teach it
<lb/>Fee Gee Hee ee jee Lee - mee te and
<lb/>think it easier - they are working
<lb/>at a primer and will send it to the
<lb/>Cape I suppose - the black men
<lb/>brought from the Cape have turned
<lb/>out badly - great professors there
<lb/>worthless &amp; <unclear cert="low">blackgaurds</unclear> - A white
<lb/>man imposed on them as an engineer
<lb/>guilty of stealing ststematically wished
<lb/>me <hi rend="underline">to take</hi> him - or give him my
<lb/>protection in the country as he reported
<lb/>of his sin - I advised him to take himself
<lb/>away where his crime was unknown 
<lb/>and there begin by turning over an

<lb/><!-- faded -->an curticle new leaf - the Makolola have
<lb/>seen those blackguards and have learned
<lb/>no good I fear - Earl Russell approved
<lb/>all my doings so you may trust me
<lb/>to go in at these vile slave hunters
<lb/>again if we can - I have just been 
<lb/>giving him an account of the way
<lb/>in which one side of the Shire
<lb/>100 a week are taken away and <!-- faded -->on
<lb/>the other  the whole country is devestated
<lb/>by the fire and sword - famine has 
<lb/>followed the <unclear cert="medium">blight</unclear> of the manganja
<lb/>from their well untreated fields &amp;
<lb/>more die of hunger than of the sword
<lb/>many sell themselves and xhildren
<lb/>keep themselves from starving
<lb/>A silly fellow Roneley has <unclear cert="medium">send</unclear> in a 
<lb/>cape <unclear cert="low">parker</unclear> that I hunted the Ajama
<lb/>everywhere and at the missionaries
<lb/>on against them - that I had a 
<lb/>pitched battle with them all makalola
<lb/>We ran away and left the bishop
<lb/>in the battle and our two quarter
<lb/>masters and engineer who were there
<lb/>reported it and we laughed &amp; raised 
<lb/>Roweley's bile - M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Glover who
<lb/>published it wrote me an apology
<lb/>and I take no notice of it but
<lb/>Roweley will not hear the last of it
<lb/>soon - I hunted the Portuguese and
<lb/>hoped to bring matters to a head by
<lb/>rhwie corn planning to our govern 
<lb/>went against me but they know

<lb/>better, and this silly letter puts the case as
<lb/>between one tribe and another and not
<lb/>between us and the Portuguese - But we 
<lb/>shall come out clean at last - I hope the 
<lb/>new bishop will be a man among
<lb/>men and not a <unclear cert="low">damned thing</unclear> - If we get
<lb/> free navigation of the Zambese at which 
<lb/>I have been striving for <hi rend="underline"> years</hi> everthing
<lb/>else will follow - M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stewart has been 
<lb/>up at <unclear cert="low">Felte</unclear> - no mission - the top of the

<lb/>they worked <!-- unclear word(s) --> trader at Ahwal North

<p>thanks for the seeds all came safely
<lb/>I tried furn trees at the grave but they 
<lb/>sprang up and died - I now try cypresses 
<lb/>the sour <hi rend="above"> or sweet</hi> sop is an aroma - see London
<lb/>or Encyclopedia Brit. - We have lots 
<lb/>of wild ones here - Kuruman is too
<lb/>cold for them - I have 6 oxen - taught
