<lb/>long ago to let you know that the hard

<lb/>by our contracting engineer has not

<lb/>which a decent engine would have done -
<lb/>and it was only a dogged determination

<lb/>to hold on so long. Leaving the labour
<lb/>of navigating the <placeName><settlement type="river">Zambesi</settlement></placeName> for a
<lb/>season <add place="below">^</add> we ascended a branch of it
<lb/>named <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire (Sheerey)</geogName></placeName> about a
<lb/><measure>hundred miles</measure>. This had never
<lb/>been examined by any <orgName>European</orgName>
<lb/>before. We then left the people
<lb/>there for awhile, and returning
<lb/>went <measure>about 20 days</measure> on foot
<lb/>beyond <measure>one hundred miles</measure>, and
<lb/>discovered a magnificent
<lb/>inland Lake called <placeName><geogName type="lake">Shirwa</geogName></placeName>

<lb/>the rich fertile valleys &amp; uplands

<lb/>felt that it was hardly fair for

<lb/>that one is quite buried in the tall

<lb/>or <unclear cert="low"> burn</unclear>, and large fields of cotton,

<lb/>tapioca is made) are met with. Sugar
<lb/>cane grows every where, and but

<lb/>the new materials of our commerce
<lb/>and if it should please Providence
<lb/>to permit us to introduce the

<lb/>of the <unclear cert="low">harp</unclear> makers, and I earnestly
<lb/>hope that I may see a beginning of a
