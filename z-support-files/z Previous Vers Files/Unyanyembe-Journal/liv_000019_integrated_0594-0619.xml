<lb/>some difficulties had occurred to prevent £500

<lb/>on till near the <date when="1871-02">end of February 1871</date> - No one
<lb/>looked near them during that time but a rumour
<lb/>reached them that the <term type="occupation">consul</term> was coming and

<lb/>not on their business but on some private

<lb/><placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName> of $2.75 per <foreign xml:lang="und">gorah</foreign> amounts
<lb/>to $220 which being charged by <persName>Ludha</persName>
<lb/>$477.50 makes an overcharge $275.50</p>

<lb/><foreign xml:lang="und"><unclear cert="medium">Kanike</unclear></foreign> at $13 per score of pieces

<lb/>is an overcharge of $5.</p>
<lb/><p>Another item to which I strongly

<lb/>the goods having never left <placeName><settlement type="town"><w>Un-

<lb/>a total overcharge of $364. 62 <choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice>
<lb/>which is a nice little sum for a

<lb/><p><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>The</corr></choice> proof of this overcharge is found
<lb/>by dividing the 3370 <choice><orig>¾</orig><reg>3/4</reg></choice> yards of the

<lb/>yards to each piece or <foreign xml:lang="und">gorah</foreign>
