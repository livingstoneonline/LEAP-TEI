<lb/><p><add place="margintop" rend="left" hand="#hand01"><hi rend="underline">On the <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/></hi>
<lb/>A grant has been made by the 
<lb/>Cape Parliament for the path through <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>
<lb/>you suggested. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> has undertaken it.</add></p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Tette</placeName> 13<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> Sept<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> 1858</p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I thank you a thousand 
<lb/>times for the wise precaution you took of 
<lb/>placing <persName>Captain Duncan</persName> on a proper understanding 
<lb/>with <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> before we left <placeName>Liverpool</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But for that we could not have lived with 
<lb/><persName>Bedingfeld</persName> in whom I am sorry to say I have 
<lb/>been completely mistaken. I confess 
<lb/>that you saw much farther than I did when you 
<lb/>disapproved of my haste in naming him 
<lb/>for whenever he was free from 
<w>sea-<lb break="no"/>sickness</w> he quarrelled with some one. First 
<lb/>the engineer and but for <persName>Captain Duncan's</persName>
<lb/>kind interposition we should have been 
<lb/>deprived of the best man that <persName>Tod</persName> &amp; <persName>Macgregor</persName>
<lb/>of Glasgow could give us. He offered to go 
<lb/>as a stoker in the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> rather than be abused 
<lb/>by <persName>Bedingfeld's</persName> tongue. That over B. shirked 
<lb/>the Bar of the <placeName>Luabo</placeName> unless I ordered him 
<lb/>again he having written orders to the effect 
<lb/>in his possession - He quarrelled with 
<lb/><persName>Duncan</persName> and every time the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> got into 
<lb/>difficulty there <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> came on board 
<lb/>&amp; had a public altercation with <persName>Duncan</persName>
<lb/>before the crew of the latter - At Row 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001357_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>N<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">o</hi></hi> 4. I put a stop to it by saying - "<persName>Captain 
<lb/>Bedingfeld</persName> I must have no more of these 
<lb/>public altercations." He retired to write his 
<lb/>resignation and delivered it to me that evening 
<lb/>I would have sent him home by the <term type="boat">Hermes</term>
<lb/>but <persName>Captain Gordon</persName> being still with us told 
<lb/>me it was done in a temporary fit of anger 
<lb/>and he would be happy to be the medium of 
<lb/>withdrawing it. I allowed him to withdraw 
<lb/>it but he at once asserted that he had 
<lb/>done quite right in writing it - that he had 
<lb/>been slighted - not consulted as man of 
<lb/>his high position ought to have been &amp;. &amp;c. 
<lb/>He had a fifth altercation with <persName>Duncan</persName>
<lb/>and though he had my written orders to pilot 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> out of the river and I had promised 
<lb/>to see that done he told <persName>Duncan</persName> with 
<lb/>some bitter taunts that "the Launch should 
<lb/>not go down if he could help it notwithstanding 
<lb/>my promise. To effect this he reported 
<lb/>to me that the rivet heads were rusting off 
<lb/>(after five weeks service only) and that 
<lb/>she could not go down to the mouth of the 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone</placeName> without making it probable that she 
<lb/>would never get up here. He wrote a protest 
<lb/>to that effect, and when I examined the 
<lb/>rivet heads and asked him to shew which 
<lb/>were rusting off - He got on his high horse 
<lb/>saying that he had always been associated with 
<lb/>gentlemen<reg>.</reg> Did I doubt his word - you are 
<lb/>not a gentleman. (referring to my early life) 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001357_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>He wanted to convert the Launch into a separate 
<lb/>command asserting to me her total incapacity 
<lb/>to carry anything. "I can tow but I can<reg>'</reg>t carry 
<lb/>anything." (I brought up four tons in her 
<lb/>this trip) and turned out the luggage to other 
<lb/>members from what he called "my cabin" the only accommodation the party had. He then 
<lb/>gave in another resignation and boasted to <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>Kirk</persName> and others that he had done so - then 
<lb/>twice expressed sorrow to myself that I had 
<lb/>not accepted it. He evidently thought himself 
<lb/>indispensible and the airs he put on no 
<lb/>tongue can tell. Would you believe that 
<lb/>the fact of his having a higher salary than I 
<lb/>have was constantly quoted as evidence of his 
<lb/>high position and attainments while he 
<lb/>absolutely could do nothing except take a latitude 
<lb/>constantly boasting of being a man of business 
<lb/>and that you had said to him that I was not 
<lb/>a man of business he shewed his talent by 
<lb/>ordering everything he could think of. Imagine 
<lb/>my consternation on seeing ninety casks 
<lb/>of Kroomen's possessions turned out of the 
<lb/><term type="boat">Pearl</term>. Well not being easily abashed I proposed 
<lb/>carrying a little in the Launch as the 
<lb/>Portuguese were engaged in a war &amp; could not 
<lb/>help us. No, no, he could tow only. It required 
<lb/>nine trips to carry our 25 tons of luggage 
<lb/>thus but by loading the Launch with two 
<lb/>tons we could <choice><sic>removed</sic><corr>remove</corr></choice> all in five - he 
<lb/>seemed then to think it necessary to prove 
<lb/>that his work was excessively difficult - 
<lb/>ran the launch aground every dozen miles - 
<lb/>kept her excessively dirty - pointedly refused 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001357_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>in presence of <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Thornton</persName> to have anything 
<lb/>to do with making a systematic arrangement 
<lb/>for the expenditure of the Kroomen's provisions 
<lb/>and at last when <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Baines</persName> ran her aground 
<lb/>as he was taking his dinner <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> said 
<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Rae</persName> - "I saw that, and let them, do you 
<lb/>think they could do without me." As he was 
<lb/>thwarting the progress of the Expedition while 
<lb/>ostentatiously promoting it, and I had borne 
<lb/>with his insubordination - carping, complaining 
<lb/>and raising objections at every step - besides 
<lb/>taunting me with not having accepted his 
<lb/>resignation I made arrangements with 
<lb/><persName>Colonel Nunes</persName> to have him safely conveyed 
<lb/>to <placeName>Kilimane</placeName> - lodged there comfortably in 
<lb/>my former quarters till a man of war 
<lb/>should call and then gave him my acceptance 
<lb/>of his resignation which he <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> by 
<lb/>dancing and singing and calling the Kroomen 
<lb/>together said - "Ah I shall soon be out at 
<lb/>Sierra Leone in charge of a man of war 
<lb/>and will know to whom to give jobs"<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He had often boasted that if that should 
<lb/>happen which had now come to pass all 
<lb/>the Kroomen would go with him. They now 
<lb/>came and told me that when <persName>Governor 
<lb/>Hill</persName> told the head man to select 11 men of 
<lb/>war's Kroomen he readily found them 
<lb/>but on finding at our arrival that <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>
<lb/>was to command all that party deserted 
<lb/>except three and now that he was dismissed 
<lb/>they would do anything for me. As he 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001357_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'--> 
<lb/>had previously tried to raise a clamour 
<lb/>by standing up for the Kroomen to get 
<lb/>their Sundays and stop the steamer for 
<lb/>their proper time for meals, while I was 
<lb/>straining every nerve and never resting 
<lb/>on that day unless we were all together 
<lb/>the country being in a state of war and 
<lb/>the healthy season passing quickly away 
<lb/>I felt very glad to find that this dodge 
<lb/>of his had failed too. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd mounting the 
<lb/>paddle box myself made a quicker passage 
<lb/>up to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> than he ever did and 
<lb/>never once touched the ground. I then tried 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName> and he being equally successful 
<lb/>you may expect <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> home 
<lb/>to nurse his dignity where it will do 
<lb/>no harm. I came up here in seventeen 
<lb/>days from <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> though the water 
<lb/>is nearly at its lowest and we spent 
<lb/>five days in one part where the river 
<lb/>is nearly four miles broad seeking a 
<lb/>passage and one half of our time was 
<lb/>spent in cutting wood. Above <placeName>Lupata</placeName>
<lb/>all is fine though many sand banks are 
<lb/>there but the river is in one channel &amp; 
<lb/>we ran up with both steam &amp; sails - 
<lb/>Here we are visited with as much 
<lb/>interest as you do the Leviathan and 
<lb/>I have got about two tons of coal in 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001357_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/>her the first ever dug in <placeName>Zambesia</placeName>. 
<lb/>I go down to bring up all my companions 
<lb/>tomorrow. <placeName>Kebra basa</placeName> is maintained to be 
<lb/>not a waterfall but a number of rocks 
<lb/>jutting out of the stream. There is a narrow 
<lb/>deep channel which at some parts is 
<lb/>rendered tortuous. If I can blast away 
<lb/>some of those that stand in the wrong 
<lb/>places I shall not grudge a few hundred 
<lb/>pounds of powder and a few months 
<lb/>toil though I don<reg>'</reg>t promise to turn 
<lb/>quarryman. My men, poor fellows 
<lb/>clustered around me and caught hold of 
<lb/>me in a sort of convulsive way while 
<lb/>some screamed with joy. I never shed 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">a</del> tears but they now ran down my 
<lb/>cheeks involuntarily. Thirty of them died 
<lb/>of small pox, and six were lately killed 
<lb/>by a rebel in his stockade at the mouth 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Luenya</placeName> - for these all our hearts 
<lb/>are very sore. They have a great stock 
<lb/>of pigs and tell me that they were often 
<lb/>taunted by the <placeName>Tett</placeName> people saying that I 
<lb/>would never return. Many have taken 
<lb/>unto themselves wives and all have lots 
<lb/>of beads which they have gained by wood 
<lb/>cutting and intend to take home. I have 
<lb/>entered poor <persName>Sekwebu's</persName> confidential servant 
<lb/>as a Krooman and I gave all the rest two 
<lb/>fathoms of cloth each. I shall give other 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001357_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'--> 
<lb/>other things when the luggage is up according 
<lb/>to your instructions.</p>
<lb/><p>Your remember the <term type="boat">Ban</term> was rejected 
<lb/>by <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>. I feel positive that she 
<lb/>is exactly what we need here - the 
<lb/>Launch whose engine ought to be called 
<lb/>the Asthmatic draws 2 ft 6 or 7 when 
<lb/>loaded and instead of "very little wood 
<lb/>being required" we give her 1 1/2 cwt 
<lb/>of dry lignum vitae each hour. B's 
<lb/>report from <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> was erroneous 
<lb/>and I found it out only after our coals 
<lb/>were done. With wood alone we never 
<lb/>get five knots out of her. The canoes 
<lb/>slowly punting along pass us and 
<lb/>look back at us to our infinite 
<w>dis-<lb break="no"/>gust.</w> The engine is badly constructed 
<lb/>the boiler tubes being placed below 
<lb/>the fire &amp; on one side - so one side of 
<lb/>the boiler is cool while the other is hot 
<lb/>and five hours are necessary to get 
<lb/>up steam. There is no steam chest 
<lb/>and though I protested than ten horse 
<lb/>was too little no more was given 
<lb/>because forsooth an old cylinder 
<lb/>cast for a low pressure was for 
<lb/>the sake of saving expense employed<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001357_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>The feed pipe is longer than the other instead of 
<lb/>being smaller and while I say that the 
<lb/>vessel herself is not a bad one <persName>Laird</persName> has 
<lb/>treated us shamefully with the engine. I was 
<lb/>passive about the <term type="boat">Ban</term> as indeed I was 
<lb/>about many other things when I had a 
<lb/>naval officer to attend to these things<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I now remember that <persName>B.</persName> was very 
<lb/>anxious that I should apply for a second 
<lb/>master and when I refused he 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>demned</w> the Ban on the report of some 
<lb/>unknown carpenter. It is impossible 
<lb/>not to suspect something was wrong 
<lb/>when we found <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> suffered 
<lb/>so much from seasickness which he 
<lb/>says grows upon him that he could 
<lb/>not have navigated her out. He has 
<lb/>frequently boasted of having been twice 
<lb/>tried by court-martial &amp; once <add place="above"><choice><sic>&amp;</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> punished</add><del type="strikethrough">dismissed 
<lb/>the navy</del>. A clever thing he did was to 
<lb/>write a "log" <hi rend="underline">after</hi> his resignation was 
<lb/>accepted from the private journal of 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Baines</persName>, and apply to me for a sextant 
<lb/>chronometer &amp;c. by way of making 
<lb/>himself appear only suspended, so as to 
<lb/>claim his pay but I told him it 
<lb/>was stopped on the 31<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">st</hi></hi> July - this was 
<lb/>the only thing that brought him to his 
<lb/>senses.</p>
