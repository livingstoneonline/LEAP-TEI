<lb/>all right</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>A barque rigged vessel 
<lb/>appeared on the South East of Flag 
<lb/>Staff island <add place="above">last night</add> and answered our 
<lb/>signals at 8 P.M. so we conclude 
<lb/>that our new vessel must be 
<lb/>near and make up our mails. See 
<lb/>a schooner opposite <placeName>Luabo</placeName> at midday.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Rowe</persName> had worked at the 
<lb/>bottom of the launch so assiduously 
<lb/>during our absence, that we thought 
<lb/>we could bring her down to 
<lb/><placeName>Senna</placeName>, and there take out the engine. 
<lb/>We took the Pinnace too - an old 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">teredo</hi> eaten one when we got her - 
<lb/>intending to stick to that which 
<lb/>swam longest. The Pinnace went 
<lb/>first, and we could put the finger 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001620_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>through any part of her bottom with ease 
<lb/>when we decided to use her as fuel<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>New holes burst out every day in 
<lb/>the Launch, sometimes seven in 
<lb/>one afternoon. We puddled &amp; patched 
<lb/>most strenuously, but at last 
<lb/>could not keep two compartments 
<lb/>from being constantly full - went 
<lb/>some days so - but happening 
<lb/>to drift on to a sand bank 
<lb/>scarcely knee deep the weight of 
<lb/>the two full compartments 
<lb/>prevented our getting her off. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>water took away the sand from the 
<lb/>upper side, and she filled all over. 
<lb/>We took our things out and the 
<lb/>river rising next day she was 
<lb/>covered. She lies one day above 
<lb/><placeName>Senna</placeName>. We have taken all the 
<lb/>good out of her that ever was in her

<lb/>I only regret that I did not get a bottom 
<lb/>plate to send to you and you would 
<lb/>see that patent steel is not the thing 
<lb/>for Tropical waters.</p>
<lb/><p>I am in want of writing paper 
<lb/>official &amp; other kinds. <persName>Baines</persName> made 
<lb/>away with our supply. We require 
<lb/>also a fresh supply of Resin of 
<lb/>Jalap and Rhubarb. Also some 
<lb/>phials for insects<reg>.</reg><persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Young</persName> will 
<lb/>select the proper kind when he 
<lb/>gets my letter - I have to beg 
<lb/>your favour in sending our 
<lb/>periodicals by your mail 
<lb/>they come so irregularly &amp; are used 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">I conjecture</hi> at the Cape that I wish 
<lb/>them sent by a man of war 
<lb/>without going to the Post Office<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is a mere conjecture on my 
<lb/>part from my periodicals having 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001620_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>been treated in the same way when I was 
<lb/>at <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName> was going home but when 
<lb/>we heard that the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> was to be 
<lb/>explored I saw <add place="above">that</add> the botany there ought to be 
<lb/>examined as well as that of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>and that he would like to go. So we 
<lb/>take him. He has done well for this 
<lb/>region. His report is a good one. 
<lb/>It will be sent next mail. <persName>Thornton</persName> has gone to <placeName>Mosambique</placeName>. His salary 
<lb/>will on my recommendation 
<lb/>be restored to him.</p>
<lb/><p>I am very much delighted with the 
<lb/>prospect of a mission from the 
<lb/>Universities - and think that great 
<lb/>good will be done. The London 
<w>Mission-<lb break="no"/>aries</w> did not let me know of their 
<lb/>movements though the Cape papers 
<lb/>spoke of them as "in connection with 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> Expedition" - and it was only 
<lb/>at <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName> that we became aware 
<lb/>of their arrival &amp; sad fate. We shall take 
<lb/>care to make the medical man of the Universities

<lb/>I have ventured to say that you can supply the name
