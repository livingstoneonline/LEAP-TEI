<lb/><p>My Dear Man</p><!-- "Copied" is written in the space after the salutation in an unknown hand HB 7-2-13 -->
<lb/><p rend="center">Your letters are "necessarily brief" So you say. and 
<lb/>I am bound to believe the <persName>Right Reverend Father William Capeton</persName>
<lb/>seeing her hath <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> two students from <placeName><settlement type="town">Hankey</settlement></placeName> into his 
<lb/>ghostly care. Ah, mine are necessarily long. long winded or 
<lb/>flatulent, as a follower of <persName>Esculapius</persName> expreeseth it, the reason
<lb/>whereof lieth in an immense sheet of paper which must be 
<lb/>filled for Nature abhorreth a vacuum, and want of time to shorten them</p>
<lb/><p>The Directors and you are wonderful men. The former 
<lb/>decline to write concerning certain minutes of committee though 
<lb/>informed that no meeting will take place till such writing 
<lb/>has been <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>. And they at same time cooly tell me that 
<lb/>they hope I shall derive counsel assistance &amp;c &amp;c. from the <w>com-
<lb break="no"/>-mittee</w> of which no meeting can take place. Then you if I recollect 
<lb/>aright twitted me about our Committee being defunct and 
<lb/>yet presume the matter of a companion will come before it. 
<lb/>But who will go? I am gone. No matter my compassion 
<lb/>can follow. The Directors requested <persName>Ashton</persName> to leave the 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> and settle with a tribe as I had done. He refused. 
<lb/>Subsequently <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Freeman</persName> proposed in Committee held at 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> that <persName>Ashton</persName> should go to <placeName><settlement type="village">Borigelong</settlement></placeName>. 
<lb/>He refused by saying "It would be like taking <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ashton</persName>
<lb/>to her grave" "Then you must take the entire charge 
<lb/>of the printing press (<persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> had till then done the

<lb/><p>I was delayed long at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> by the Boers and want 
<lb/>of people for all feared to go North. but having got over these 
<lb/>difficulties we made very good progress till we came into <choice><abbr>Lat.</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice>
<lb/>19Â° 16' South. There all my people were knocked down by <term type="ailment">fever</term>
<lb/>except one <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> lad. I managed the hospital and he the oxen 
<lb/>and by God<supplied>'</supplied>s mercy none were cut off. When we were able to 
<lb/>move Northwards. the poor <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> lad took it too. I had to 
<lb/>drive and cut a path too for keeping more to the Eastward in order 
<lb/>to avoid the Tsetse we traveled through a densely wooded country 
<lb/>in which the axe was in constant operation. But for 
<lb/>two bushmen who managed the loose oxen and otherwise assisted 
<lb/>we could not have moved. Some were still so weak we had to 
<lb/>lift them out and <unclear cert="low">mind</unclear> the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>. When we came near the <placeName><geogName type="river">Chobe</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>the <choice><sic>ajacent</sic><corr>adjacent</corr></choice> country was flooded for 15 miles out. <choice><sic>Vallies</sic><corr>Valleys</corr></choice> appeared 
<lb/>like large deep rivers with hippopotami in them. We tried 
<lb/>long <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">in vain</add> to get a ford through one large river called <placeName><geogName type="river">Sanshureh</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>our bushmen decamped too. So I took a small pontoon kindly 
<lb/>presented by <choice><abbr>Mssrs</abbr><expan>Misters</expan></choice><persName>Welch</persName> and <persName>Codrington</persName> and the strongest of my 
<lb/>weak crew. crossed the <placeName><geogName type="river">Sanshureh</geogName></placeName>. <choice><orig>Â½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> a mile wide and went 
<lb/>North to find the <placeName><geogName type="river">Chobe</geogName></placeName> &amp; people. We waded among reed and high 
<lb/>grass for three days trying to obtain a passage in to the <placeName><geogName type="river">Chobe</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>through the dense masses of reed &amp;c which line its banks

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000794_0003"><!--pb/@n='0003'--></pb>
<lb/>On the fourth day we obtained our object, launched the pontoon and 
<lb/>after passing along about 20 miles we reached a <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> village 
<lb/>In their figurative language they said I "had come upon them as if 
<lb/>I had dropped out of a cloud yet I came riding on the back of a 
<lb/>hippopotamus" A rumour had reached the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> previously 
<lb/>and two parties had been sent out in search of us. All our difficulties 
<lb/>were now at an end. Canoes were soon sent down by the chief 
<lb/>our <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>s &amp;c. were transported <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice> the country &amp; river &amp; 
<lb/>after proceeding North in order to avoid the flooded lands on the 
<lb/>other side, we turned <choice><abbr>S.W.</abbr><expan>South West</expan></choice> &amp; reached the town. Our reception was 
<lb/>far more flattering than I could have anticipated. The chief just over 
<lb/>18 years of age said he rejoiced to obtain another father instead of <persName><unclear cert="medium">Sebitoane</unclear></persName>
<lb/>and repeated<supplied cert="high">ly</supplied> requested me to name whatever I wished and he would shew 
<lb/>his affection by giving it. cattle, ivory, &amp;c &amp;c and he seemed distressed 
<lb/>when I refused to name anything. He is not equal in appearance 
<lb/>or abilities to his father but there is nothing weak or childish in his 
<lb/>conduct or conversation, and several executions which have taken 
<lb/>place on account of conspiracy, shew that he is not destitute of 
<lb/><persName>Sebitoane</persName>'s energy. He is afraid to learn to read at present "lest it 
<lb/>should change his heart and make him content with one wife" 
<lb/>as in the case of <persName>Sechele</persName>. I like a frank objection - one cannot 
<lb/>get a hold on a "<foreign xml:lang="und">Ya Mynheer</foreign>" They are too oily. I have just 
<lb/>returned from a nine weeks tour through the country in search of 
<lb/>a suitable location for a mission. Went up the Barotse River or 
<lb/>as it is universally called by the <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term> - the aboriginal inhabitants 
<lb/>- the black race of whom I spoke - the <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeamb</geogName></placeName> or "the River." <!-- Cannot find special character in map for long emphasis on y in Leeamby HB 9-1-13 -->
<lb/>reached the confluence of the Loeti with its light coloured water
<lb/>also that of the Leeba or Lonta. Lonta is the proper nam<supplied cert="high">e</supplied>
<lb/>because it comes from <placeName><settlement type="town">Londa</settlement></placeName> the capital of a large state. The 
<lb/>confluence of the Londa and <choice><sic>Leeamby</sic><corr>Leeambye</corr></choice> is in 14Â° 11' South
<lb/>this is a point of great importance for the <choice><sic>Leeamby</sic><corr>Leeambye</corr></choice>. twins 
<lb/>thence away to the East <choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> East. The Londa about 150 yards 
<lb/>wide. (the <choice><sic>Leeamby</sic><corr>Leeambye</corr></choice> about 250 <supplied cert="high">yards</supplied> beyond it) The Londa coming from 
<lb/>the <choice><abbr>N.</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> &amp; by <choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>West</expan></choice> or <choice><abbr>N.N.W.</abbr><expan>North North West</expan></choice> is. I dream yet to form part 
<lb/>of our way West. Conveyance by water is of great importance 
<lb/>with 6 paddlers we went 44 miles of Latitude in one day of 10<choice><orig>Â½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice>
<lb/>hours and taking into account the windings of the river and 
<lb/>our course being what sailors term a 2<choice><orig>Â½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> point one the actual 
<lb/>distance must have been upwards of 50 Geographical miles 
<lb/>The river is one of very great beauty &amp; breadth. It is often more 
<lb/>than a mile broad with islands 3 or four miles long in it. 
<lb/>These are covered with sylvan vegetation. The rounded masses 
<lb/>of which seem to recline on the bosom of the water. The 
<lb/>Tsetse spoils the most beautiful and healthful spots. I must 
<lb/>reserve details. but after a laborious search have not 
<lb/>found a spot I could pronounce salubrious. We must 
<lb/>brave the <term type="ailment">fever</term>. It is God not the Devil that rules our <!-- Not sure if this "fever" is meant metaphorically, but coded as ailment just in case HB 9-1-13 -->

<lb/>write readily. And <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> from the Farthest trading station 
<lb/>inland on the West. The latter probably through the influence of 
<lb/>the <persName>Chevalier Du Pratt</persName>'s letter and passport shewed me every civility 
<lb/>An intrigue with an underchief who had pretentions to the 
<lb/>chieftainship enabled the latter to drive a brisk trade in slaves 
<lb/>in the Northern half of the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> country. Nothing was done 
<lb/>here. to encourage them to call again. A stockade was erected 
<lb/>in the <term type="tribe">Barotse</term> country, a flagstaff for the <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> banners 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">erected</del><add place="above">set up</add>. A small cannon given to the pretender who it is supposed 
<lb/>gave authority for the prosecution of the slave trade contrary 
<lb/>to the orders of the chief. The conduct on the part of the merchant 
<lb/>was very silly for no sooner was the intrigue known, than the 
<lb/>chief conspirators were cut off and their bodies tumbled into the River <!-- Does River need to be coded somehow? HB 9-1-13 -->
<lb/>On my remonstrating against bloodshed the answer given was "We are 
<lb/>still Boers. We are not yet taught." They would have expelled the 
<lb/>slave merchant too. but refrained on my representing that their 
<lb/>doing so might injure me in the West and their departure is 
<lb/>to take place soon. I go Westward as soon as the rains commence 
<lb/>I have preached in many spot<supplied cert="high">s</supplied> where the name of <persName>Christ</persName> was never 
<lb/>heard before. This is matter for gratitude. Hope the gospel will yet 
<lb/>be established in these savage lands. I travelled in a company of 160 
<lb/>in 33 canoes. From the chief downwards all strove to shew kindness 
<lb/>Nine weeks intimate intercourse - hearing their conversation, anecdotes 
<lb/>quarrelling, roaring dancing, singing and murdering, have imparted 
<lb/>a greater disgust at heathenism than I ever had before. And on coin
