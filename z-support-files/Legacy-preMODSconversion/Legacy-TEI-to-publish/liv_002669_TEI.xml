<lb/><p rend="left"><handShift new="#hand01"/>Copy. 
<lb/><handShift new="#hand02"/>30.5.69 </p>
<lb/><p><handShift new="#hand03"/>From <persName>Jno Kirk, Esq</persName> Polit Agent &amp; Her Majesty's 
<lb/>Consul, <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> to <persName>C. Gonne, Esq</persName> Sec<hi rend="sup">y</hi>
<lb/>to Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of <placeName>Bombay</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>I have the <choice><sic>honor</sic><corr>honour</corr></choice> to enclose herewith for 
<lb/>the information of the Right Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> the Governor 
<lb/>in Council, the copy of a letter from <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>Livingstone</persName> dated 30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> May 1869 and 
<lb/>received at <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> this evening. </p>
<lb/><p>The requests made by <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Livingstone</persName>
<lb/>in a previous communication that reached 
<lb/>on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ult having been already complied 
<lb/>with I shall lose no time in supplying 
<lb/>the things herein demanded. There will 
<lb/>however be some difficulty in getting 
<lb/>faithful men as the Arabs of <placeName>Unyanyembe</placeName>
<lb/>being of the <term type="tribe">El Haothi</term> tribe are by no 
<lb/>means loyal subjects of <persName>Syud Majid</persName>, and, 
<lb/>as <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi>Livingstone</persName> tells us still engaged 
<lb/>in the slave trade. </p>
<lb/><p rend="center">Dated 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>May 1869 
<lb/>from <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> David Livingstone</persName>
<lb/>to <persName>Jno Kirk, Esq</persName> Polit Agent, <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>This notes goes by <persName>Inusa Kamaals</persName>, 
<lb/>who was employed by <persName>Koorji</persName> to drive the 
<lb/>buffaloes hither, but by overdriving them 
<lb/>unmercifully in the sun, and tying them 
<lb/>up to save trouble in herding, they all 
<lb/>died before he got to <placeName>Unyanyembe</placeName>. He 
<lb/>witnessed the plundering of my goods 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002669_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>and got a share of them, and I have 
<lb/>given him beads and cloth sufficient to buy 
<lb/>provisions for himself on the way back 
<lb/>to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>. He has done nothing here. 
<lb/>He neither went near the goods here, nor 
<lb/>tried to prevent their being stolen in the 
<lb/>way. I supposed that pay for four 
<lb/>months in coming other four of rest 
<lb/>and four in going back would be 
<lb/>ample, but I leave this to your decision. 
<lb/>I could not employ him to carry my 
<lb/>mail back nor can I say anything 
<lb/>to him, for he at once goes to the 
<lb/>Ujijians and gives his own version 
<lb/>of all he hears. He is untruthful and 
<lb/>ill conditioned, and would hand off 
<lb/>the mail to anyone who wished to 
<lb/>destroy it. The people here are like 
<lb/>the Kilwa traders, haters of the English. 
<lb/>Those <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> men whom I met 
<lb/>between this and <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> were gentlemen 
<lb/>and traded with <choice><sic>honor</sic><corr>honour</corr></choice>. <choice><reg>H</reg><orig>h</orig></choice>ere, as in the 
<lb/>haunts of the Kilwa horders, slaving is 
<lb/>a series of forays, and they dread 
<w>ex-<lb break="no"/>posure</w> by my letters. No-one will take 
<lb/>charge of them. I have got <persName>Thani bin 
<lb/>Suellim</persName> to take a mail privately for 
<lb/>transmission to <placeName>Unyanyembe</placeName>. It contains 
<lb/>a cheque on Ritchie, Stewart &amp; Co. of <placeName>Bombay</placeName>, for Rupees 2000 and some forty letters 
<lb/>written during my slow recovery. I 
<lb/>fear it may never reach you. A party 
<lb/>was sent to the coast two months ago. 
<lb/>One man volunteered to take a letter secretly 
<lb/>but his master warned them all not to 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002669_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>do so because I might write something 
<lb/>he did not like. He went out with the 
<lb/>party and gave orders to the head man 
<lb/>to destroy any letter he might detect on 
<lb/>the way. Thus, though I am good friends 
<lb/>outwardly with them all, I can get no 
<lb/>help in procuring carriers, and as you will 
<lb/>see if the mail comes to hand I send 
<lb/>to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> for fifteen good boat men 
<lb/>to act as carriers if required, 30 pieces 
<lb/>of Meritrane, 40 pieces of Kimitra, 12 
<lb/>Farasalas of the beds called Jannsam, shoes 
<lb/>&amp;c. and I have written to <persName>Syud Majid</persName>
<lb/>begging two of his guard to see to the safety 
<lb/>of the goods here into <persName>Thani bin Suellim's</persName>
<lb/>hands or into those of <persName>Mahomed bin Saleh</persName>. </p>
<lb/><p>As to the work to be done by me it 
<lb/>is only to connect the sources which I 
<lb/>have discovered from 500 to 700 miles 
<lb/>south of Speke and Baker's with their 
<lb/><placeName>Nile</placeName>. The volume of water which 
<lb/>flows north from Lat. 12° south is so 
<lb/>large I suspect, that I have been 
<lb/>working at the sources of the <placeName>Congo</placeName>
<lb/>as well as those of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>. I have 
<lb/>to go down the eastern line of drainage 
<lb/>to Baker's turning point. <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName>, 
<lb/><placeName>Nyige</placeName>, <placeName>Chowambe</placeName> (Baker's?) are one water, 
<lb/>and the head of it is 300 miles south 
<lb/>of this. The western and central lines 
<lb/>of drainage converge into an unvisited 
<lb/>lake west or south-west of this. The 
<lb/>outflow of this, whether to <placeName>Congo</placeName> or <placeName>Nile</placeName>
<lb/>I have to ascertain. The people west of 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002669_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>this, called <term type="tribe">Manyema</term>, are cannibals if 
<lb/>Arabs speak truly. I may have to go 
<lb/>there first, and down <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName>, if 
<lb/>I come out uneaten, and find my 
<lb/>new squad from <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>. I earnestly 
<lb/>hope that you will do what you can 
<lb/>to help me with the goods and men. 
<lb/>£400 to be sent by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Young</persName> must 
<lb/>surely have come to you through 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">Heming</unclear> and Co. </p>
<lb/><p>P.S. A long box paid for to <placeName>Ujiji</placeName> was left at <placeName>Unyanyembe</placeName> and so with other 
<lb/>boxes. </p>
