<lb/><p rend="right">On board S.S. England </p>
<lb/><p rend="right">31<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Oct<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> 1856 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Thompson </p>
<lb/><p>Having left the 
<lb/><placeName>Mauritius</placeName> on the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> we now find 
<lb/>ourselves within two days of <placeName>Galle</placeName>
<lb/>and as we may find the steamer 
<lb/>for Aden about to leave as we 
<lb/>enter that port I prepare a note 
<lb/>to let you know of my progress 
<lb/>thus far. I believe I let you 
<lb/>know by a letter per <persName>George Fleming</persName>
<lb/>that I had by my sojourn at 
<lb/><placeName>Mauritius</placeName> got completely over 
<lb/>an affection of the spleen entailed 
<lb/>on me by frequent attacks of 
<lb/>fever, this happy result was 
<lb/>owing by God's blessing 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000924_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>to the salubrity of Clevemont the residence 
<lb/>of <persName>Major General Hay</persName> whose hospitality 
<lb/>I shall ever remember with gratitude. 
<lb/>I saw but little of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Le Brun</persName> but hear 
<lb/>he has been very useful in <placeName>Mauritius</placeName>, 
<lb/>and as deservedly respected. I saw less 
<lb/>of his sons. One lately went to <placeName>Seychelles</placeName>
<lb/>with his wife who is consumptive 
<lb/>the bishop has gone thither also, 
<lb/>in the Frolic, but for religious 
<lb/>purposes. As I was five miles from 
<lb/>town I did not form many 
<w>acquaint-<lb break="no"/>ances.</w> And have for a long time been 
<lb/>longing most ardently for reunion 
<lb/>with my family. As for the future 
<lb/>I can say nothing I shall let you 
<lb/>know how I shall act when 
<lb/>I have seen my way clear myself<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000924_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>If you are writing to <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> I 
<lb/>shall feel obliged by your mentioning 
<lb/>that I am so far well and on my way 
<lb/>home. Also, if <persName>George Fleming</persName> is near 
<lb/>you say, as he can not write or read 
<lb/>what is written that he must look 
<lb/>after ten shillings which he directed 
<lb/>a man of the Frolic called <persName>Muno</persName>
<lb/>or some such name to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice>
<lb/>and pay to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wright</persName> for my 
<lb/>washing. <persName>Muno</persName><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the 
<lb/>money as directed but told <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>W.</persName>
<lb/>that <persName>George</persName> owed it to him, and 
<lb/>I had to pay <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>W.</persName> another ten 
<lb/>shillings instead. <persName>Muno</persName> is a coloured 
<lb/>man and <persName>George</persName> will know him 
<lb/>by this if I have mistaken the 
<lb/>name. My peacoat which you 
<lb/>sent from the <placeName>Cape</placeName> is gone &amp; a new 
<lb/>blanket is substituted by an old one 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000924_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>which served me all the way from 
<lb/><placeName>Loanda</placeName> and was given to the poor 
<lb/>fellow who drowned himself<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Another is taken away which I 
<lb/>prized as that thrown over me by 
<lb/><persName>Sekeltu</persName> during a terrible storm<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I don't know whether these things 
<lb/>have been stolen or not in the Frolic 
<lb/>the parcel does not seem to have 
<lb/>been touched. But about the 
<lb/>money there can be no doubt &amp; 
<lb/><persName>George</persName> can manage that when 
<lb/>the Frolic comes to the <placeName>Cape</placeName>. </p>

<lb/><p>Misfortunes don<reg>'</reg>t come alone - my sextant 
<lb/>got smashed by <persName>George</persName> putting it to the 
<lb/>tiller below, he had packed it without 
<lb/>knowing, tell <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Maclear</persName> my misfortune<reg>.</reg></p><addSpan spanTo="#p1r-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left hand margin of p1r-01'--></addSpan>
