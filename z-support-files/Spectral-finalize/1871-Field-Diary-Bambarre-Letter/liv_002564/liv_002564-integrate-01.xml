<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Waller</persName> - I yesterday <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> gladly your 3

<lb/>is like to break my heart - You "gave <persName>Kirk</persName> all the news and 
<lb/>he would impart them to me" but he had other matters to 
<lb/>attend to and as usual I have to whistle for news - I am
<lb/>the man with too many friends - Oh says Muff <choice><abbr>N<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi></abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice> 1 such
<lb/>a nice book has come out - I would send it but you have so 
<lb/>many friends I am sure that someone must have sent it 
<lb/>already - <choice><abbr>N</abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice>2 says I would have given you the news but
<lb/>you have so many friends &amp;c &amp;c - <choice><abbr>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi></abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice> 3 says our large 
<lb/>national educational establishment in which I have the 
<lb/>honour to free a chair ought to help if not take on them 
<lb/>the education of your children - I would do it myself but 
<lb/>you have so many friends &amp;c - The upshot is I <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> nothing</p>
<lb/><p>Two great friends removed my three boys at my expense 
<lb/>and against my wish from a healthy school in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>to an abominable "Do the boys Hall" in <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName> &amp; they were 
<lb/>all home sick three months afterwards - ! I am glad of 
<lb/>all you told me when you forgot the idea of others telling 
<lb/>me and wrote naturally as a married man ought to do 
<lb/>I did not know of <persName>Young</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice> trip up after me nor of <persName>Musa</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice>
<lb/>lies till now - The successful laying of the <placeName><geogName>Atlantic</geogName></placeName> cable 
<lb/>I Enferred from my Canadian brother saying "last cable 
<lb/>news told us you were alive &amp; we put off our mourning" 
<lb/>I infer that a new Government or ministry is in
<lb/>power because you speak of <persName>John Bright</persName> &amp; <persName>Duke Argyll</persName>
<lb/>as ministers - Well I am off in a few days to finish 
<lb/>with the help of the Almighty new explorations - Ten 
<lb/>men here come from <persName>Kirk</persName> who like the good fellow 
<lb/>that he is worked unweariedly to get them &amp; goods off in 
<lb/>the midst of disease and death â€“ one gang of porters died 
<lb/>quite off and five of my men perished by <term type="ailment">cholera</term> - We get that 
<lb/>from <placeName><settlement type="city">Mecca</settlement></placeName> - letters preceded it thence saying it was coming - 
<lb/>We do nothing to stop its hatching in <placeName><settlement type="city">Mecca</settlement></placeName> <placeName><settlement type="city">Medina</settlement></placeName> &amp; <placeName><settlement type="city">Judda</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>which annually become vast cesspools of abomination 
<lb/>because the new political economy says let everything alone 
<lb/>Formerly it went along shore now it comes inland - In our 
<lb/>small camp here we lost 30 &amp; how many <term type="tribe">Manyema</term> no one 
<lb/>knows - All the able bodied all off ivory collecting - if it had 
<lb/>continued three instead of two months the camp would have 
<lb/>been desolate - Fowls &amp; goats fell first then cattled shivered 
<lb/>and died &amp; then men. I quite expect to hear that it went to the 
<lb/><placeName>Cape</placeName> - I got the copy of the Standard you sent - I have not seen 
<lb/>the "Times" for an age - I differ from you for I am proud 
<lb/>of our great Paper and only sorry when it admits the babble 
<lb/>of the clubs - Jupiter must be nodding when he admits <persName>Cooley</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice>
<lb/>ill natured twaddle as "geography". I would not answer him 
<lb/>why he boldly challenged me to argue the point whether the great 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> above the <placeName><geogName type="feature"><choice><abbr>falls</abbr><expan>Victoria Falls</expan></choice></geogName></placeName> were a river - He maintained that it 
<lb/>was "an undeveloped river" that went under the ground of 
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName>Kalahari</geogName></placeName> and was lost, and in what he called a map 
<lb/>put it down as ending in a pothook - doubtless meaning 
<lb/>if the "learned" the "erudite" Cooley could be so low as use a 
<lb/>hieroglyphic to say "here it hooks it" - that shut me up from 
<lb/>answering for ever - My work leads me down <placeName><geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>in canoes till it touches the head of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName> probably near 
<lb/>the Eastern arm followed down by <persName>Speke</persName> <persName>Grant</persName> &amp; <persName>Baker</persName>
<lb/>then double back up the Western line of drainage to the 
<lb/>fountains on the <placeName><geogName>Watershead</geogName></placeName> - on return I shall not
<lb/>go down the Western arm of the loop formed by the end 
<lb/>of <persName>Baker</persName><choice><sic>s</sic><corr>'s</corr></choice> water and <unclear cert="medium">it - the</unclear> Northern part of which

<lb/>I conjectured it was

<lb/>lug themselves forward to the public - For your private information 
<lb/>I tell you that my party consisted of fifteen Muhamadans 
<lb/>six pagan Hindoos six christians &amp; four Heathen - the Moslems 
<lb/>were by far the worst in every respect - The christians had the mis 
<lb/>fortune to have been born slaves in their own tribes &amp; had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the 
<lb/>worst training in the world from Moslem slavetraders but behaved           
<lb/>better than the Moslems till we came into close contact with Moslems 
<lb/>again - the Heathen had been in the Portuguese service and were 
<lb/>infinitely inferior to heathen <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> in consequence - I have
<lb/>heard gentlemen from <placeName><country>India</country></placeName> speak of native christians with 
<lb/>contempt because they had never seen any save the vile
<lb/>scum that hangs about camps which may be called moral
<lb/>cess pools - I have seen the native christians in India which
<lb/>these silly gentlemen pretend to describe and they are as different
<lb/>from the "Masters caste" men who say "I drink brandy" as one
<lb/>can <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> - I have travelled with all sorts of Africans
<lb/>and I can without hesitation assert that the native Christians
<lb/>are out of sight better than either Moslems or heathen - only
<lb/>let them understand thoroughly that they are servants and
<lb/>must work as hard as slaves - They are not gentlemen and
<lb/>you will have trustworthy &amp; generally truthful attendants -
<lb/>The trouble you will have with them is just what all have with 
<lb/>English servants and every other - I am to be judged by the work done -</p>
<lb/><p>I am truly thankful that there is some prospect of the
<lb/>suppression of the East African slave trade as carried on
<lb/>by the <choice><sic>Sultans</sic><corr>Sultan's</corr></choice> subjects - I have heard but little of the details
<lb/>but I believe a great deal is owing to the exertions of our
<lb/>friend <persName>Kirk</persName> on whom for his share may Heavens
<lb/>rich blessing descend - the sights I have in this journey
<lb/>seen of slaving make my blood run cold and I am not
<lb/>easily moved or very Sentimental - I cannot call the Arabs
<lb/>cruel - but <add place="inline">^</add> <add place="above">it is the trade that is cruel and certainly is vil<gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">e</supplied></add> few are like those wretches the <placeName><settlement type="town">Kilwa</settlement></placeName> traders
<lb/>or the atrocious Portuguese of <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName> whose murder and
<lb/>arson you witnessed - But it is an awful traffic and 
<lb/>can be congenial only to the Devil and his angels - If our
<lb/>statesmen stop the frightful waste of human life in this
<lb/>region and mitigate the vast amount of human woe
<lb/>that accompanies it they will do good on the large scale
<lb/>and cause joy in Heaven - The whole horrible system 
<lb/><placeName>North of <geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> &amp; <placeName><geogName>Cape Delgado</geogName></placeName> is to support the Sultan 
<lb/>of <placeName><region>Zanzibar</region></placeName> who is said to be by no means very greedy
<lb/>of money save to uphold his little court &amp; attendants -

<lb/>slaves is not <term type="ailment">earth or clay eating</term> which too is a disease
<lb/><hi rend="underline">per se</hi> but what really seems to be <term type="ailment">brokenheartedness</term>
<lb/>It does not attack those who have been slaves in their own
<lb/>land but those who have been free - I saw a party taken
<lb/>across <geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName> by a slaver and when they saw this mighty
<lb/>river roll between them and home they seemed to lose all
<lb/>heart - Twenty one who were then considered safe were
<lb/>unchained <space dim="horizontal" extent="3" unit="chars"/> all scuttled off to the mountains but eight
<lb/>still in the chain and in good health died in three days</p>

<lb/>many think that the <term type="bodypart">heart</term> is under the upper part
<lb/>of the <term type="bodypart">sternum</term> or <term type="bodypart">breastbone</term> - I saw many others
<lb/>die - some were kindly carried and on expiring were

<lb/>why they died and had plenty to eat - I once saw a party

<lb/>asked the cause

<lb/>was told that

<lb/>I had to enquire
<lb/>the meaning of the
<lb/>word to "haunt and

<lb/><p><gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">T</supplied>hen it was "oh you

<lb/><foreign xml:lang="und">Manga</foreign> but the
<lb/>yoke is off when 
<lb/>I die and back
<lb/>I shall come to
<lb/>haunt and to kill 
<lb/>you" Then all
<lb/>joined in the
<lb/>chorus which was 
<lb/>the name of each
<lb/>vendor as if it
<lb/>were "oh Johnny
<lb/>Smith Oh Johnny Smith Oh Oh"
<lb/>It told not of fun but of the bitterness and tears
<lb/>of such as were oppressed <add place="inline">^</add> <add place="above">and on the site of the oppression there was power</add> and they had
<lb/>no comforter - "There be higher than they."</p>
<lb/><p>I am terribly knocked

<lb/>in my second childhood <space dim="horizontal" extent="3" unit="chars"/> a dreadful

<lb/>again - I stick to my work in spite of
<lb/>everything because most of my friends

<lb/>will say as my good daughter does - "much as I wish to have

<lb/><p>News came lately to <placeName><settlement type="town">Ujiji</settlement></placeName> that a large body of Turks (Egyptians?)
<lb/>came and attacked <persName>Sunna</persName> - They were repulsed and fled in disorder

<lb/><cb/>
<lb/><p><persName>Baker</persName> does not seem to be aware how
<lb/>often the Portuguese have tried the conquering
<lb/>plan and always failed - more signally
<lb/>in the West perhaps than the East but it may

<lb/>on the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> the natives to a man were
<lb/>most friendly - the Portuguese instructed from
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement></placeName> were civil but hated us &amp; the expedition
<lb/>with <persName>Baker</persName> the Turks will be as friendly as the

<lb/>But for cannon <persName>Sunna</persName> could conquer <placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName>
<lb/>far more easily than 3000 troops could injure
