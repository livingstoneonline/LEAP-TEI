<lb/>a guide - country gently undulating 
<lb/>shewing fine green slopes fringed 
<lb/>with green wood trees = grass from 
<lb/>4 ft to 6 feet high - Luamba or cotton 
<lb/>meadow grass general and <unclear>Nyassi</unclear>
<lb/>in patches - came to Katenga village 
<lb/>about 5 miles off - many villages &amp; 
<lb/>many people passed going to market 
<lb/>with loads of provisions - soil a little 
<lb/>sandy allows good drainage</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-24">24<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Great rain by night, and sickness of men 
<lb/>who as slaves take great care of themselves 
<lb/>a little headache prevents our march -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-25">25<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Went to Mazimwe about 7½ miles off 
<lb/>country undulating and grassy- trees 
<lb/>scarce - Patches of <unclear>shrubs or Aruba?</unclear>appear at 
<lb/>every village - cassava far off on account 
<lb/>of the pigs which are abundant: cross
<lb/><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-26">26<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Rill Lohemba - then four miles and cross 
<lb/>Kabwemadgi Rt - then a mile beyond it 
<lb/>the Rt Kahembai which flows into 
<lb/>the Kunda and it into Lualaba - The 
<lb/>great river being on our left - country 
<lb/>open and low hills appear - in N. 
<lb/>We now met a party of men from 
<lb/>the traders at Kasenga's - Salem bin 
<lb/>Mukadam and Seyed bin Sultan and counted 
<lb/>eighty two captives they had caught 
<lb/>them by fighting ten days with the 
<lb/>people of Surampela on the left bank 
<lb/>of Lualaba - They were hired to go 
<lb/>against them by the chief Chipange
<lb/>for two tusks and seven slaves - They 
<lb/>had about 20 tusks and carried one 
<lb/>who broke his own leg in rushing 
<lb/>against a stump in the fight -</p>

<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-27">1871 March 27<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Went along a ridge of land overhanging 
<lb/>a fine valley of denudation well-cultivated 
<lb/>hills in distance <choice><abbr>N</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> - where Hassani's feat 
<lb/>of bloodshed was performed - Many villages 
<lb/>on the ridge some rather tumble down ones, 
<lb/>which always indicate some misrule - 
<lb/>our march about seven miles and a 
<lb/>headman who went with us plagued ours 
<lb/>to give a goat - I refused to take what was 
<lb/>not given willingly but the slaves secured it 
<lb/>and threatened our companion Kama with 
<lb/>dismissal from our party if he became 
<lb/>a tool in slave hands - Arum common -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-28">28</date></add> - I had hoped to gain influence in time 
<lb/>over the Banian slaves and went forward 
<lb/>though short of everything in the <unclear>prospect</unclear>
<lb/>of finishing my work and retiring but they 
<lb/>were not affected by kindness and <unclear>now</unclear>
<lb/>tried to finish the few beads that got out 
<lb/>of some 700 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> at Ujiji by demanding 
<lb/>extra rations - They tried compulsion 
<lb/>to force me back to the coast - and it is 
<lb/>remarkable that all the slaves sent by 
<lb/>the great slave trader Ludha were fully of 
<lb/>the opinion that they were not to follow 
<lb/>but force me back - crossed the Liya</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-29">29</date></add> and next day the Moangoi, by two well 
<lb/>made wattle bridges at an island in its bed 
<lb/>It is 20 yds and has a very strong current 
<lb/>which makes all the market people fear it 
<lb/>We then crossed the Molembe in a canoe 
<lb/>It is 15 yds but swelled by rains &amp; many 
<lb/>rills - came 7½ miles to sleep at one 
<lb/>of the outlying villages of Nyangwe - 
<lb/>about sixty market people came past 
<lb/>us from the chitoka or marketplace 
<lb/>on the banks of Lualaba - They go 
<lb/>thither at night and come away about 
<lb/>midday - having disposed of most of 
<lb/>their goods by barter - country

<lb/><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-30">1871 March 30<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> - open and dotted over with trees chiefly 
<lb/>a species of Bauhinia that resists the 
<lb/>annual grass burnings - trees along the
<lb/>watercourses and many villages 
<lb/>each with a host of pigs - country low 
<lb/>as compared with Tanganyika - about 
<lb/>2000 feet above the sea - The headman's 
<lb/>house in which I was lodged contained 
<lb/>the housewifes little conveniences in 
<lb/>the shape of forty pots dishes baskets knives 
<lb/>mats all of which she removed to another 
<lb/>house - I gave four strings of beads &amp;
<lb/>go on tomorrow - Crossed the Kunda R. 
<lb/>other seven miles brought us to Nyangwe 
<lb/>where we found Abed and Hassani 
<lb/>had erected their dwellings and sent their 
<lb/>people over Lualaba and as far West as 
<lb/>the Loeki or Lomame - Abed said that 
<lb/>my words against bloodshedding had 
<lb/>stuck into him and he had given orders 
<lb/>to his people to give presents to the chiefs 
<lb/>but never fight unless actually attacked</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-03-31">31<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi></date></add> Went down to take a good look at the 
<lb/>Lualaba here - It is narrower than it is 
<lb/>higher up but still a might river at 
<lb/>least 3000 yards broad and always 
<lb/>deep - It can never be waded at any 
<lb/>point, or at any time of the year - The 
<lb/>people unhesitatingly declare that if any 
<lb/>one tried to ford it he would assuredly be 
<lb/>lost - It has many large islands and 
<lb/>at these it is about 2000 yards or one 
<lb/>mile - The banks are steep and deep - 
<lb/>of clay and a yellow clay schist in 
<lb/><unclear>their structure</unclear> the other rivers as 
<lb/>the Liya and Kunda have gravelly 
<lb/>banks - The current is about 2 miles 
<lb/>an hour away to the North

	<pb xml:id="p663" n="663"/>
<lb/><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-01">1871 April 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi></date></add> The banks are well peopled but one must 
<lb/>see the gathering at the market of about 3000 
<lb/>chiefly women to judge of their numbers - 
<lb/>They hold market one day and then omit 
<lb/>attendance here for three days - going to 
<lb/>other markets at other points in the intervals - 
<lb/>It is a great institution in Manyuema - 
<lb/>Numbers seem to inspire confidence and 
<lb/>they enforce justice for each other - As 
<lb/>a rule all prefer to buy and sell in the 
<lb/>market to doing business anywhere else 
<lb/>If one says come sell me that fowl or 
<lb/>cloth - the reply is come to the "chitoka" or 
<lb/>marketplace -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-02">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi></date></add> - They were afraid of my presence - suspicious 
<lb/>and some think from the slanders of the 
<lb/>traders that to sell a canoe means to help 
<lb/>me to kill and murder Manyuema -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-03">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi></date></add> - Tried to secure a longitude by fixing a 
<lb/>a weight on the key of the chronometer and 
<lb/>taking successive altitudes of the sun 
<lb/>and distances of the moon - Possibly 
<lb/>the first and last altitudes may give 
<lb/>the rate of going - and the frequent distances 
<lb/>between may give approximate Long -</p>
<lb/><p>Here the river is as stated 3000 
<lb/>yards - large islands in the distance 
<lb/>I sounded it across - It is nine feet 
<lb/>near the bank - In the middle fifteen 
<lb/>feet - Between the islands twelve feet 
<lb/>and again nine feet near the shore 
<lb/>It is said to overflow all its banks 
<lb/>annually except at elevated spots 
<lb/>on which are built - soil 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">unusually</unclear> stiff black loam adjacent
<lb/>to the banks - very fertile &amp; very 
<lb/>feverish - A mighty river truly

<lb/>in three or four days - This to guide 
<lb/>in ascertaining day of observing the 
<lb/>lunars with the weight -</p>
<lb/><p>The Arabs ask many questions 
<lb/>about the Bible - How many 
<lb/>prophets have appeared &amp; probably 
<lb/>say, that they believe in them all 
<lb/>while we believe all but reject Mu-
<lb/>-hamad - It is easy to drive them 
<lb/>into a corner by questioning as they 
<lb/>dont know whither the enquiries lead 
<lb/>and they are not offended when their 
<lb/>knowledge is as it were admitted - 
<lb/>When asked how many false 
<lb/>prophets are known they appeal to 
<lb/>my knowledge and evidently never 
<lb/>heard of Balaam the son of Beor 
<lb/>or of the 250 false prophets of Jezebel 
<lb/>and Ahab - or of the many lying 
<lb/>prophets referred to in the Bible</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-06">6<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Ill from drinking two cups of very 
<lb/>sweet malofu or beer made from 
<lb/>Bananas - I shall touch it no more</p>
<lb/><p>Made ink from the seeds of a plant 
<lb/>called by the Arabs Zugifure - It is 
<lb/>a fine thick red colour and used 
<lb/>by the natives to ornament their faces 
<lb/>heads and to dye grass cloths or 
<lb/>virambas - It is known in India</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-07">7<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> I have to wait trying to buy a canoe 
<lb/>sent people over to cut wood to build a 
<lb/>new hut - one sleeps in his mud 
<lb/>walls which are damp and foul 
<lb/>smelling and unwholesome - - 
<lb/>I shall have grass walls for my 
<lb/>own hut for the free ventilation

<lb/><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-07">1871 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> April</date></add> will keep it sweet - This is the season 
<lb/>called Masika - the finishing rains 
<lb/>It is the worst time for travelling and 
<lb/>reconciles me to the delay - We have 
<lb/>heavy rains almost every night 
<lb/>and I could scarcely travel even if I 
<lb/>had a canoe - But still it is trying to be 
<lb/>kept back by suspicion and by the 
<lb/>wickedness of the wicked -</p>
<lb/><p>Some of the Arabs try to be kind and 
<lb/>send cooked food every day - Abed is 
<lb/>the chief donor - I taught him to make 
<lb/>a mosquito curtain of thin printed 
<lb/>calico - He had endured the persecution 
<lb/>of these insects helplessly except by 
<lb/>sleeping on a high stage when they 
<lb/>were unusually bad - The Manyuema 
<lb/>often bring evil on themselves by being 
<lb/>untrustworthy - Paid one to bring a 
<lb/>large canoe to cross Lualaba - He brought 
<lb/>a small one capable of carry three only 
<lb/>and after wasting some hours we had 
<lb/>to put off crossing till next day -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-08">8<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Every Manyuema headman of four 
<lb/>or five huts is a Mologhwe or chief 
<lb/>and glories in being called so - There 
<lb/>is no political cohesion in the country 
<lb/>The Ujijian slaving is an accursed 
<lb/>system but the Manyuema too have 
<lb/>faults the result of ignorance of other 
<lb/>peoples - Their isolation has made them 
<lb/><add place="marginleft">as</add> unconscious of danger in dealing 
<lb/>with the cruel strangers as little dogs 
<lb/>in the presence of lions - Their refusal 
<lb/>to sell or lend canoes for fear of blame 
<lb/>from each other will be ended by the 
<lb/>party of Dugumbe which has ten head
<lb/>men taking them by force - They are

	<pb xml:id="p666" n="666"/>
<lb/><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-08">1871 April 8<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> often unreasonable and bloody 
<lb/>minded towards each other - Every 
<lb/>Manyuema head man would like every 
<lb/>other ruler slain - This subjects them 
<lb/>to bitter lessons and sore experience 
<lb/>from the Arabs who join a <unclear>fend</unclear> only 
<lb/>for their own selfish ends of getting 
<lb/>goats and slaves</p>
<lb/><p>Abed went over to Mologhwe Kahembe 
<lb/>and mixed blood with him - was told 
<lb/>of two canoes hollowed out which are 
<lb/>to be brought for sale - If this can be 
<lb/>managed peaceably it will be a great 
<lb/>point gained and I may secure one 
<lb/>even at an Arabs price which will 
<lb/>be three or four times that of a native 
<lb/>No love lost among the Arabs here 
<lb/>but I keep my own counsel -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-09">9<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Cut wood for house - Loeki is said 
<lb/>by slaves who have come thence to 
<lb/>be much larger than the Lualaba 
<lb/>but on the return of Abeds people 
<lb/>from the West we shall obtain 
<lb/>better information</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-10">10<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> Chitoka or market today - I counted 
<lb/>upwards of 700 passing my door 
<lb/>With market women it seems to 
<lb/>be a pleasure of life to haggle &amp; 
<lb/>joke and laugh and cheat - Many 
<lb/>come eagerly, and retire with care 
<lb/>worn faces - Many are beautiful 
<lb/>and many old and carry very heavy 
<lb/>loads of dried cassava &amp; earthen 
<lb/>pots which they dispose of very 
<lb/>cheaply for palm oil fish salt 
<lb/>pepper and relishes for their food 
<lb/>The men appear in gaudy lambas

<lb/>loss for the day of the month - New house 
<lb/>finished - a great comfort for the other 
<lb/>was foul and full of vermin - Bugs 
<lb/>Tapazi or ticks that follow wherever 
<lb/>Arabs go made me miserable but the 
<lb/>Arabs are insensible to them - Abed alone 
<lb/>had a mosquito curtain, and never 
<lb/>could praise it enough - One of his remarks 
<lb/>is if slaves think you fear them they 
<lb/>will climb over you - I clothed mine for 
<lb/>nothing, and ever after they have tried to 
<lb/>ride roughshod over me and mutiny 
<lb/>on every occasion -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-14">14<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> - Kahembe came over &amp; promises to bring 
<lb/>a canoe but he is not to be trusted - He 
<lb/>presented Abed with two slaves and is 
<lb/>full of fair promises about the canoe 
<lb/>which he sees I am anxious to get - 
<lb/>They all think that my buying a 
<lb/>canoe means carrying war to the left 
<lb/>bank - and now my Banian slaves 
<lb/>encouraged the idea - He does not wish 
<lb/>slaves nor ivory said they <unclear>but</unclear> a 
<lb/>canoe in order to kill Manyuema - 
<lb/>Need it be wondered at that people who 
<lb/>had never heard of strangers or white 
<lb/>men before I popped down among 
<lb/>them believed the slander - The 
<lb/>slaves were aided in propagating the 
<lb/>false accusation by the half caste 
<lb/>Ujijian slaves at the camp - Hassani 
<lb/>fed them every day and seeing that 
<lb/>he was a bigotted Moslem they equalled 
<lb/>him in prayers in his sitting place 
<lb/>seven or eight times a day -!</p>

<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-15">1871 April 15<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> They were adepts at lying and the 
<lb/>first Manyuema words they learned 
<lb/>were used to propagate falsehood.</p>
<lb/><p>The Manyuema tribe called Ba-
<lb/>-genya occupy the left bank opposite 
<lb/>Nyangwe - A spring of brine rises 
<lb/>in the bed of a river named Lofubu 
<lb/>and this the Bayenga inspissate by 
<lb/>boiling and sell the salt at market 
<lb/>The Lomame is about ten days West 
<lb/>of Lualaba and very large - The confluence 
<lb/>of Lomame or Loeki is about six 
<lb/>days down below Nyañgwe by canoe 
<lb/>The river Nyanze is still less distant</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-16">16<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> On the Nyanze stands the principal 
<lb/>town and market of the chief Zurampela 
<lb/>Rashid visited him and got two 
<lb/>slaves on promising to bring a war
<lb/>party from Abed against Chipange 
<lb/>who by similar means obtained the 
<lb/>help of Salem Mokadam to secure 
<lb/>82 captives - Rashid will leave 
<lb/>this as soon as possible sell the slaves 
<lb/>and leave Zurampela to find out 
<lb/>the fraud - This deceit which is an average 
<lb/>specimen of the beginning of half 
<lb/>caste dealings vitiates his evidence 
<lb/>of a specimen of cannibalism 
<lb/>which he witnessed - but it was 
<lb/>after a fight that the victims were 
<lb/>cut up and this agrees with the 
<lb/>fact that the Manyuema eat 
<lb/>only those who are killed in 
<lb/>war - some have averred that 
<lb/>captives too are eaten and a slave 
<lb/>is bought with a goat to be eaten 
<lb/>but this I very strongly doubt.</p>

<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-18">1871 April 18<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> I found that the Lepidosiren is brought 
<lb/>to market in pots with water in them 
<lb/>also white ants roasted and the large 
<lb/>snail Achetina and a common snail 
<lb/>Lepidosiren is called "<hi rend="underline">sembe</hi>" -</p>
<lb/><p>Abed went a long way to examine a canoe 
<lb/>but it was still further and he turned -</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-19">19<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date></add> It is dreary waiting and when Abed 
<lb/>proposed to go North I wished to go too 
<lb/>but my slaves were the hindrance and 
<lb/>we still had hopes of a canoe which would 
<lb/>have been a great boon to me now that 
<lb/>it was raining every day</p>
<lb/><p><add place="marginleft"><date when="1871-04-21">21<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi></date></add> A common salutation reminds me of 
<lb/>the Bechwana's "U le hatsi" thou art on 
<lb/>earth - "Ua tala" thou lookest - "Ua boka" 
<lb/>or byoka thou awakest - "U ri ho" thou art 
<lb/>here - "U li koni" thou are here about pure 
<lb/>Sichuana - and Nyā-No is identical 
<lb/>The men here deny that cannibalism is 
<lb/>common - They eat only those killed in 
<lb/>war and it seems in revenge for said 
<lb/>Mokandira "the meat is not nice - It 
<lb/>makes one dream of the dead man" - 
<lb/>Some West of Lualaba eat even those 
<lb/>bought for the purpose of a feast but 
<lb/>I am not quite positive on this point. 
<lb/>All agree in saying that human flesh 
<lb/>is saltish and needs but little condi-
<lb/>-ment - And yet they are a fine 
<lb/>looking race - I would back a company 
<lb/>of Manyuema men as far superior 
<lb/>in shape of head and generally 
<lb/>physical form against the whole 
<lb/>Anthropological Society - Many of the 
<lb/>women are very light coloured and 
<lb/>very pretty - They dress in a kilt 
<lb/>of many folds of gaudy lambas</p>
