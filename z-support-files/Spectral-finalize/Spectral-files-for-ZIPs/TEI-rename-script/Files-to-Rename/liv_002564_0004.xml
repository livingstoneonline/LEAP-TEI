<lb/>many think that the <term type="bodypart">heart</term> is under the upper part
<lb/>of the <term type="bodypart">sternum</term> or <term type="bodypart">breastbone</term> - I saw many others
<lb/>die - some were kindly carried and on expiring were
<lb/>laid down on the side of the path - The masters wondering
<lb/>why they died and had plenty to eat - I once saw a party
<lb/>in the slave yoke singing merrily &amp; thought my
<lb/>these fellows have taken to it kindly - they must belong
<lb/>to the class to whom
<lb/>slavery is the
<lb/>natural state
<lb/>for which they
<lb/>were born - I          
<lb/>asked the cause
<lb/>of their mirth &amp;
<lb/>was told that
<lb/>they laughed at
<lb/>the idea "of coming
<lb/>back after death
<lb/>and haunting &amp;
<lb/>killing those who
<lb/>had sold them"
<lb/>Some of the words
<lb/>I had to enquire
<lb/>the meaning of the
<lb/>word to "haunt and
<lb/>kill by spirit power"</p>

<lb/>haunt and to kill 
<lb/>you" Then all
<lb/>joined in the
<lb/>chorus which was 
<lb/>the name of each
<lb/>vendor as if it
<lb/>were "oh Johnny
<lb/>Smith Oh Johnny Smith Oh Oh"

<lb/>will say as my good daughter does - "much as I wish to have

<lb/><p>News came lately to <placeName><settlement type="town">Ujiji</settlement></placeName> that a large body of Turks (Egyptians?)
<lb/>came and attacked <persName>Sunna</persName> - They were repulsed and fled in disorder

<lb/><p><persName>Baker</persName> does not seem to be aware how
<lb/>often the Portuguese have tried the conquering
<lb/>plan and always failed - more signally
<lb/>in the West perhaps than the East but it may
<lb/>be different with him and though I dont
<lb/>know his plan I hope he may do good
<lb/>on the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> the natives to a man were
<lb/>most friendly - the Portuguese instructed from
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement></placeName> were civil but hated us &amp; the expedition
<lb/>with <persName>Baker</persName> the Turks will be as friendly as the
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> natives to us - but I fear that the
<lb/>common people will be like our Portuguese
<lb/>But for cannon <persName>Sunna</persName> could conquer <placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName>
<lb/>far more easily than 3000 troops could injure
