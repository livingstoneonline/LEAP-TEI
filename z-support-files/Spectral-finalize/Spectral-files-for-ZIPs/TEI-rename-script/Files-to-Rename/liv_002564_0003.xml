<lb/>lug themselves forward to the public - For your private information 
<lb/>I tell you that my party consisted of fifteen Muhamadans 
<lb/>six pagan Hindoos six christians &amp; four Heathen - the Moslems 
<lb/>were by far the worst in every respect - The christians had the mis 
<lb/>fortune to have been born slaves in their own tribes &amp; had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the 
<lb/>worst training in the world from Moslem slavetraders but behaved           
<lb/>better than the Moslems till we came into close contact with Moslems 
<lb/>again - the Heathen had been in the Portuguese service and were 
<lb/>infinitely inferior to heathen <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> in consequence - I have
<lb/>heard gentlemen from <placeName><country>India</country></placeName> speak of native christians with 
<lb/>contempt because they had never seen any save the vile
<lb/>scum that hangs about camps which may be called moral
<lb/>cess pools - I have seen the native christians in India which
<lb/>these silly gentlemen pretend to describe and they are as different
<lb/>from the "Masters caste" men who say "I drink brandy" as one
<lb/>can <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> - I have travelled with all sorts of Africans
<lb/>and I can without hesitation assert that the native Christians
<lb/>are out of sight better than either Moslems or heathen - only
<lb/>let them understand thoroughly that they are servants and
<lb/>must work as hard as slaves - They are not gentlemen and
<lb/>you will have trustworthy &amp; generally truthful attendants -
<lb/>The trouble you will have with them is just what all have with 
<lb/>English servants and every other - I am to be judged by the work done -</p>
<lb/><p>I am truly thankful that there is some prospect of the
<lb/>suppression of the East African slave trade as carried on
<lb/>by the <choice><sic>Sultans</sic><corr>Sultan's</corr></choice> subjects - I have heard but little of the details
<lb/>but I believe a great deal is owing to the exertions of our
<lb/>friend <persName>Kirk</persName> on whom for his share may Heavens
<lb/>rich blessing descend - the sights I have in this journey
<lb/>seen of slaving make my blood run cold and I am not
<lb/>easily moved or very Sentimental - I cannot call the Arabs
<lb/>cruel - but<add place="inline">^</add><add place="above">it is the trade that is cruel and certainly is vil<gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">e</supplied></add> few are like those wretches the <placeName><settlement type="town">Kilwa</settlement></placeName> traders
<lb/>or the atrocious Portuguese of <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName> whose murder and
<lb/>arson you witnessed - But it is an awful traffic and 
<lb/>can be congenial only to the Devil and his angels - If our
<lb/>statesmen stop the frightful waste of human life in this
<lb/>region and mitigate the vast amount of human woe
<lb/>that accompanies it they will do good on the large scale
<lb/>and cause joy in Heaven - The whole horrible system 
<lb/><placeName>North of <geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> &amp; <placeName><geogName>Cape Delgado</geogName></placeName> is to support the Sultan 
<lb/>of <placeName><region>Zanzibar</region></placeName> who is said to be by no means very greedy
<lb/>of money save to uphold his little court &amp; attendants -

<lb/>the <persName>Governors D'Almrida</persName> destroyed our work &amp; people
<lb/>unchecked - The most startling disease I have seen among
<lb/>slaves is not <term type="ailment">earth or clay eating</term> which too is a disease
<lb/><hi rend="underline">per se</hi> but what really seems to be <term type="ailment">brokenheartedness</term>
<lb/>It does not attack those who have been slaves in their own
<lb/>land but those who have been free - I saw a party taken
<lb/>across <geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName> by a slaver and when they saw this mighty
<lb/>river roll between them and home they seemed to lose all
<lb/>heart - Twenty one who were then considered safe were
<lb/>unchained <space dim="horizontal" extent="3"/> all scuttled off to the mountains but eight
<lb/>still in the chain and in good health died in three days</p>
