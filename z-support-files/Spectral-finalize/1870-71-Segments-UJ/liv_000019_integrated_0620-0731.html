<br/><p class="p "><span class="note   marginleft"><span class="">July <br/>23<span class="sup ">d</span> <br/>1870</span></span> The sores on my feet laid me up
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>as irritable eating ulcers - if the foot were
<br/>put to the ground a discharge of bloody ichor
<br/>flowed and the same discharge happened
<br/>every night with considerable pain that
<br/>prevented sleep - the wailing of the slaves
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>is one of the night sounds of a slave camp
<br/>they eat through everything muscle tendon
<br/>bone and often lame permanently if they
<br/>do not kill the poor things - medicines 
<br/>have very little effect - their periodicity
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>seems to say that they are allied to Fever
<br/>The Arabs make a salve of Bees wax and 
<br/>sulphate of copper and this applied hot
<br/>and held on by a bandage affords support
<br/>but the necessity of letting the ichor
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>escapes renders it a painful remedy. 
<br/>I had three ulcers and no medicine the 
<br/>native plan of support by means of a 
<br/>stiff leaf or bit of calabash was too irritating 
<br/>they continued to eat in and enlarge 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in spite of everything - the vicinity was 
<br/><span class="note   marginleft"><span class="">Sept<span class="sup ">r</span> <br/>6<span class="sup underline ">th</span></span></span> hot and the pain increased with the size
<br/>I was at last advised to try Malachite
<br/>rubbed down with water on a stone and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>applied with a feather - this was the 
<br/>only thing that had any beneficial effect
<br/>Copper rubbed down in the same way is
<br/>a remedy of good repute but malachite
<br/>alone proved beneficial in my case
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="note   marginleft"><span class="">26<span class="sup underline ">th</span></span></span> I have been able now to report the 
<br/>ulcers healing - For eighty days I was 
<br/>completely laid up by them and it was 
<br/>long ere the lost substance was replaced
<br/>they kill many slaves - and an 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>epidemic came to us which carried

<br/>he is constantly picking out earth out of the

<br/>and eating them - the symptoms are swelling 
<br/>of the face hands and feet - If the fingernail
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>is squeezed it is bloodless - the patient is
