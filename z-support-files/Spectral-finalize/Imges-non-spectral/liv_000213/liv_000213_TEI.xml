<lb/>(<persName ref="people.xml#pers0002">Muhamad</persName>) allow him to be killed while 
<lb/>they were here?" I said that it was a false

<lb/>sent his son to assure us that he was 
<lb/>slandered, but thus quarrels and bloodshed 
<lb/>feuds arise. The great want of the <term type="tribe" ref="ethnic-group.xml#ethnic0010">Manyema</term> 
<lb/>is national life. Of this they have none. 
<lb/>Each <term type="occupation">headman</term> is independent of every other. 
<lb/>Of industry they have no lack, and the villagers 
<lb/>are orderly towards each other, but they go 
<lb/>no further. If a man of another district ventures 
<lb/>among them it is at his peril. He is not 
<lb/>regarded with more favour as a <term type="tribe" ref="ethnic-group.xml#ethnic0010">Manyema</term> 
<lb/>than one of a herd of <term type="animal">buffaloes</term> is by the

<lb/>was killed by five spear wounds. The old

<lb/>murdered, and after this cruel man was

<lb/>that he had killed <persName ref="people.xml#pers0107"><choice><orig>Moenekus</orig><reg>Moenekuss</reg></choice></persName>' son. This

<lb/>speaking from the hidden abysses of the
