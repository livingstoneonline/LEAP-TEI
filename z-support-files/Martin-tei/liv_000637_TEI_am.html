<br/>He has not succeeded with <span class="">Sechele</span>
<br/>but has with <span class="">Sekomi</span>. <span class="">Cumming</span>
<br/>seems to have forestalled him. I feel
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>sorry I was not there when <span class="">Evans</span>
<br/>came through. I think <span class="">Sechele</span> has
<br/>a prejudice against him ever since
<br/>he was there in partnership with
<br/><span class="">Greig</span>. I might have removed part
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of it. I think it would be more
<br/>for his advantage to deal with <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hume</span>
<br/>than with <span class="">Cumming</span>. The latter has
<br/>always been very anxious that he should
<br/>conclude a bargain to deal with him

<br/>what the <span class="">Griquas</span> will do in his country  
<br/>before he returns to it. We could not come
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>by a straighter course as we intended, the
<br/>big waggon being too heavy for travelling
<br/>through the long grass. We spent sunday
