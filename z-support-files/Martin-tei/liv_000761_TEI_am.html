<br/><p class="p left">My Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p left">Herein you will <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span> the fulmination
<br/>of the <span class="">Commandant <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Potgieter">Potgeiter</span></span> who I believe has gone to
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>a tribunal at which nothing but truth will be told
<br/>It is a <span class="">copy</span> sent from the <span class="">committee</span> by the then secretary
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ashton</span>. The answer which they sent me at
<br/>the same time is I find not by me - but it must   
<br/>be at <span class="">Kolobeng</span> and as soon as I can lay hands
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>upon it I shall forward it<span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>A <span class="add  above">re</span> - perusal of the
<br/><span class="">document</span> brought some circumstances to my 
<br/>mind which had nearly vanished from my 
<br/>memory. One was that when the Bakwains heard
<br/>of the intentions of the <span class="">Boers</span> to molest me they
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>instantly called a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Peecho</span> and resolved unanimously
<br/>to defend their missionary with their blood. On
<br/>my objecting to their exposing their lives on my 
<br/>account they replied it was on their own
<br/>account for whatever was done to me was
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>done to them. They intended to mislead the 
<br/><span class="">Boers</span> into a strong ambuscade if they found
<br/>out by any means that they were approaching 
<br/>and a simultaneous attack was to follow by 
<br/>both guns &amp; assegais. If they should come upon
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>us at unawares the whole tribe was to rush

      

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>to our house and defend us with their lives. Had <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Potgieter">Potgeiter</span></span>
<br/>come he would have met a very different reception
<br/>from any he ever had before. The tribes he has attacked
<br/>never could do him or <span class="">his party</span> on horseback any
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>harm. His fighting has been a series of cold blooded
<br/>murders. In his bloodthirstiness he has poured out
<br/>drunk offerings to the Devil. What a terrible surprise 
<br/>such men must look upon their prowess in the
<br/>still shades of Hades. No false pretences there
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of "making peace among the <span class="">natives</span>" and no
<br/>Predikants to baptize them into the belief that
<br/>they are <span class="">christians</span> and no mistake and then 
<br/>land them in the "Land <span class="">African</span>". I am 
<br/>however preaching to you instead of writing
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>a letter. Well when I saw the Bakwains
<br/>were determined to doctor the <span class="">Boers</span> I thought
<br/>it right to send my family out of the way
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> L.</span> was in child-bed but much preferred
<br/>going <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">westward</span> with the Bakwain women
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to going to <span class="">Kuruman</span>. The <span class="">Kurumanites</span>
<br/>pressed upon us the propriety of sending the
<br/>family out there - and I did so about four
<br/>months after the threats of the <span class="">Boers</span> had
<br/>vanished into thin air. a short time after
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>they left for <span class="">Kuruman</span> I departed for the
<br/>Lake - the first time - I remember too that

    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>the imputation of having run away nettled me more
<br/>than all the rest. I wrote on the paper in pencil the 
<br/>words you see &amp; left the <span class="">letter</span> in a conspicuous 
<br/>situation at <span class="">Kolobeng</span> in case they should come
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>when I was absent at the Lake. I destroyed abou<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: ">[ ]</span>
<br/><span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">350</span> letters</span> before going - and many of these I regret
<br/>but felt unwilling anything should fall into their
<br/>hands of which they could make any bad use</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am here in the house of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Alheit</span> of
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Skeit</span> Fontein</span> and may inform you how 
<br/>we have succeded hitherto. We have come
<br/>but slowly. My <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">oxen</span> were lean but quite
<br/>fresh. I used them only and by buying some 
<br/>and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: exchanging">exhanging</span> others as they became tired
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>for fresh ones giving about 10/ on each for
<br/>the extra flesh of the new ones I succeeded 
<br/>pretty well. I shall soon be at the River and
<br/>thence will get on well. The oxen I have now
<br/>are in good condition &amp; will carry me thither
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>quickly.. The waggon however is enormously
<br/>heavy - This <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">loading</span> is one of those things I shall do
<br/>but once in my life. We had to pass through
<br/>a bad defile - and hired a span from a 
<br/><span class="">Boer</span> to take us through. He took us into
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>it but his large fat oxen could not move
<br/>it farther. I inspanned our meagre beasts and
      
      

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>they walked out with it at once. The <span class="">Boer</span> then left
<br/>us in disgust and when we had got fairly through
<br/>wanted payment but this I declined.. I shall feel
<br/>glad when I deliver the articles to their owners
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>The wood work of the wheels cracks from the
<br/>enormous strain There now take a lesson
<br/>by my folly. Of <span class="">George</span> I have seen nothing
<br/>though I have travelled so slowly. I gave him two
<br/>men so as they do not make their appearance
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he must be on his way after us either by 
<br/>the road we hence come or by some other
<br/>we shall be sure to meet at <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>I have been quite busy all the way with the
<br/><span class="">Dictionary</span> I did not know I had so 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>many words in my head as I have put
<br/>down but every time I sit down there is
<br/>no end to them. They are hooked together
<br/>by strange associations. I have not begun any
<br/>thing else. The waggon is most inconvenient
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>for writing. I can write only on my side 
<br/>and must <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">doff</span> &amp; trek on my "inexpressibles"
<br/>only when lying flat on my back. I must
<br/>be getting old &amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: ill-natured">illnatured</span> now for the constrained 
<br/>positions of my waggon life rather makes me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>crusty than gentle. The longer one lives the 
<br/>more one learns, is however true</p>

<br/>Well done my hearties. If I had £800 or even
<br/>£400 a year travelling expenses as you my Lord

<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>would not be so <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: self-denying">self denying</span>. No not I. I would
<br/>sport good oxen in my waggon and good horses

<br/><p class="p ">You will have observed a great deal of ignorance
<br/>apparent in his <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Lordship">Lorship</span></span>'s notes and a great
<br/>deal understood or rather presumed in the 
<br/>readers for whom it is intended- see the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Preface</span>. You are expected to believe that
<br/>he passed through unknown regions and
<br/>even where he seems to have been without
<br/>a path you find him looking for <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Harding</span>'s 
<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">spoor</span>. And mention is made of <span class="">Captain
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>Gardner</span> but none of a body of troops which

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>The earnestness with which he works is however
<br/>very pleasant and almost excuses the ignorance

<br/>makes the least part of <span class="">his book</span> by imitating
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Independents">Independants</span></span> way of doing things. And as for
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the missionary's daughter's, bless his heart we

<br/>or any one else. Have heard nothing about

<br/>The <span class="">Boers</span> are certainly the remnants of
<br/>the <span class="">Lost Tribes of <span class="">Israel</span></span> they speak  
<br/>of nothing but Pounds, shillings, dollars
<br/>guilders sheep &amp; oxen. Their whole 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>souls seem absorbed by this world's
<br/>goods - Their talk is just exactly 
<br/>what you overhear in the <span class="">Jews</span>

<br/>I hear something else.
