<br/><p class="p "><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Meller">Mellr</span></span> very
<br/>willingly volunteered 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to run down &amp; see 
<br/><span class="">Procter</span>, and I hope 
<br/>your mind will 
<br/>be relieved somewhat 
<br/>by his Presence and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Procter</span> by his advice. 
<br/>Those who are

<br/><span class="">Magrath</span> - <span class="">Pearce</span>

<br/><span class="">Wilson</span> - <span class="">Ali</span> &amp; <span class="">Mabruck</span>
<br/>my brother &amp; <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span>
<br/>will take all their luggage 
<br/>with them - The canoe 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for which I thank 
<br/>you heartily, the big
<br/>green boat and 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Thornton</span>'s - I 
<br/>wish the boats to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>be brought up at 
<br/>once with anything 
<br/><span class="">Jose Nunes</span> may 
<br/>have purchased - but 
<br/>it must be by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class=""><span class="">Shupanga</span> people</span> 
<br/>If we can get the 
<br/>men we had to

<br/><span class="">Johanna</span> &amp; <span class="">Rovuma</span>
<br/>they are a good rowing 
<br/>and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: poling">poleing</span> <span class="">crew</span> 
<br/>but this we <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>make sure of - I 
<br/>have requested <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span>
<br/>Kirk</span> to engage ten 
<br/><span class=""><span class="">Shupanga</span> men</span> to 
<br/>allow those we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>have to retire - two 
<br/>of them wished to 
<br/>go today and brought 
<br/>all the others to say 
<br/>they would go too 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I have no objection 
<br/>to them going but 
<br/>they must give me 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>timely warning - <span class="">Pennel</span>
<br/>wishes to go also - 
<br/>and <span class="">Meller</span> would fain 
<br/>join the stampede by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>ignoring seven months 
<br/>absence from service 
<br/>I take - this ill as 
<br/>it takes me aback 
<br/>while had I been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>forewarned I should 
<br/>have had all in 
<br/>train - He will go 
<br/>by July. I am
<br/>sorry to part with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>my brother &amp; <span class="">Kirk</span>
<br/>but they have 
<br/>honourably served 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>their time and more 
<br/>But I am not down 
<br/>hearted I feel rather 
<br/>lightened because 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>most of the money 
<br/>spent on this <span class="">Expedition</span>
<br/>has not been on 
<br/>the objects primarily 
<br/>in view but in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>birds beetles &amp; 
<br/>pebbles. The <span class="">Great 
<br/>Scientific men</span> 
<br/>crowded around 
<br/>me when it was 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>known I was 
<br/>going out and every 
<br/>one had his claim 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>for a man in his 
<br/>speciality. I yielded 
<br/>and in order to 
<br/>give each an opportunity 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of distinguishing him 
<br/>self allowed all 
<br/>his collections to go 
<br/>home in his own 
<br/>name and in his 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>own charge. We shall 
<br/>see if this leads to 
<br/>the mineral and 
<br/>vegetable wealth 
<br/>being made better 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>known - Henceforth 
<br/>I am at my own 
<br/>proper work and 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>looking around on 
<br/>this devastated valley 
<br/>I feel with <span class="">Lord 
<br/>Palmerson</span> that the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> must be 
<br/>put down before 
<br/>lawful commerce 
<br/>can succeed.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our first load 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>will be our black 
<br/>whaler and I shall 
<br/>try and make our 
<br/>selves independent 
<br/>of the <span class="">South</span> for 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>fresh provisions 
<br/>&amp; <span class="">native</span> food. 
<br/>I have proposed 
<br/>to <span class="">Galdino</span> to have 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/><span class="">Jaõ</span> of <span class="">Shupanga</span> bring 
<br/>up our man of war 
<br/>stores if <span class="">Lito</span> declines 
<br/>I mentioned <span class="">Clarke</span>'s
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>case to the captain 
<br/>who may call &amp; said 
<br/>his expenses would 
<br/>be borne by the bishop</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Thanks for the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Brandy &amp; gin. I 
<br/>enclose your note 
<br/>for £8 - <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>£5 will 
<br/>do at present - give 
<br/>it to <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I am concerned 
<br/>for <span class="">Procter</span> but 
<br/><span class="">Meller</span> will direct 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0009</span>
<br/>you - If his tongue 
<br/>has brown fur on 
<br/>it I would without 
<br/>hesitation give 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>½ <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">chachin</span> doses 
<br/>of calomel- the 
<br/>others here who are 
<br/>better acquainted 
<br/>with the treatment 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that ought to be 
<br/>pursued would 
<br/>probably not agree 
<br/>in this - We have 
<br/>had no discussion 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>on the point but 
<br/>I have found them 
<br/>efficaceous very 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0010</span>
<br/>I sympathize in 
<br/>your difficulties 
<br/>but what are they 
<br/>for but to be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>surmounted - a 
<br/>grey ox took a sulky 
<br/>fit and behaved 
<br/>like a perfect 
<br/><span class="">heathen</span> on our 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>way home when 
<br/>we were just coming 
<br/>in in triumph. 
<br/>all four legs straight 
<br/>out held back all 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the others &amp; ploughing 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<br/>the ground with his 
<br/>toes - left him in 
<br/>the yoke alone &amp; then 
<br/>of course he had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to try &amp; bring the 
<br/>waggon himself 
<br/>I pray that we 
<br/>may be directed 
<br/>to strive for and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>bend all our 
<br/>energies in the 
<br/>right direction &amp;
<br/>surely he who 
<br/>bore our griefs 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and carried our 
<br/>sorrows will 
<br/>hear in his mercy

<br/>the cry of his poor 
<br/>creatures</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Last night was the 
<br/>anniversary of my 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Mary</span>'s death. <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>that

<br/>think of her as looking

<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>interest in our work 
<br/>thanks for your
