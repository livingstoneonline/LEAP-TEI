<br/><p class="p left">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p ">On the <span class="">10<span class="sup ">th</span> of February</span> last I left this station and having
<br/>proceeded into the <span class="">Interior</span> of the <span class="">Bechuana Country</span> remained there
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>during the months <span class="">March</span>, <span class="">April</span>, <span class="">May</span>, and part of <span class="">June</span>.
<br/>The whole of that period was characterised by the continued manifestation
<br/>of the Divine goodness towards me and now with humble gratitude to 
<br/>Him whose Providential care watched over and brought me back
<br/>in safety, I shall endeavour to state to you the objects for which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>this journey was undertaken and the manner in which they were
<br/>followed out. The objects I had in view were the following ᅳ </p>
<br/><p class="p ">That I might by exclusive intercourse with the <span class="">natives</span>
<br/>facilitate my labour in the acquisition of the language, ᅳ that
<br/>I might for a season be freed from all attention to medicine ᅳ
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>And that, though still but imperfectly acquainted with their
<br/>tongue, I might make an effort for the eternal welfare of the
<br/>tribe or tribes with whom I should sojourn by means of
<br/><span class="">native</span> agents.<span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span> In order the more effectually to carry
<br/>into operation the last &amp; principal object I had in contemplation
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I took with me two <span class="">natives</span>, <span class="">members</span> of the church in
<br/>this place. And with two others connected with the
<br/>management of the waggon we proceeded in a
<br/>direction nearly North East of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Moteeto</span></span>. This route brought
<br/>us near to more of the tribes which lie <span class="">East</span> and <span class="">West</span> of
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>it. And consequently we saw no people save a few of
<br/>the Bakalihari and <span class="">Bushmen</span> until after twelve days
<br/>travelling we arrived in the valley of the Bakhatla. There
<br/>we saw three villages, each of which may be stated to
<br/>contain a population of 400 souls. The situations of
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>these are very inviting for the valley is both beautiful
<br/>and large. Not less I think than forty miles in length
<br/>and from two to four in breadth. And besides abund-
<br/>-ance of iron-stone, it contains no fewer than seven
<br/>fountains each of which pours out a copious supply
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of excellent water</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As the <span class="">people</span> however are the sole manufacturers of
<br/>the iron and wooden utensils in use among the Bechuanas
<br/>and in trading pass among all the tribes to the <span class="">Southward</span>
<br/>I thought it probable that they may have imbibed some
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>of the prejudices to the <span class="">gospel</span> which prevail to such a  
 
                

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>a lamentable extent among these, and consequently might not be in
<br/>such a favourable state for the operations of <span class="">native</span> teachers as some
<br/>tribes which live still farther to the <span class="">North</span>. We therefore only
<br/>remained a few days with them. Their behaviour to us was
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>however as kind as we could have expected. We found no
<br/>difficulty in collecting them together, and when we addressed 
<br/>them on salvation by <span class="">Christ</span> they listened with respectful
<br/>attention. I earnestly hope the time is not far distant when they 
<br/>shall hear statedly and with believing hearts the glad tidings
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of mercy ᅳ</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Nearly directly <span class="">North</span> of the Bakhatla and a little more than
<br/>one hundred miles distant, lives <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Bubi</span></span>, one of the chiefs of the 
<br/>Bakwain(Baquane)and one of the most sensible of his <span class="">class</span>
<br/>I have yet seen. To him we next proceeded, and the very
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: friendly">freindly</span> reception <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Edwards</span> and I met with from both him
<br/>and <span class="">his people</span> last year, the very favourable character he
<br/>bears among all the tribes, and the fact that <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>E.</span> found them
<br/>entirely ignorant of the <span class="">gospel</span>, induced me to prefer mak-
<br/>-ing a commencement for a <span class="">native</span> teacher with them.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p ">The beginning of the school for the children was as favourable
<br/>as we could desire. The chief expressed much joy at the
<br/>thought of having the <span class="">foreigners</span> as his friends and went
<br/>himself and collected the children. He supplied me with milk
<br/>regularly, and when payment was offered he promptly declined
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>His under chiefs continued to supply <span class="">my people</span> with food
<br/>during most of our stay and although the waggon attracted
<br/>crowds of visitors daily on no occasion did we miss
<br/>a single article ᅳ <span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span>Not long after our arrival it occurred 
<br/>to me that it would be advantageous if we could lead out
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>for irrigation the fine stream which winds round the
<br/>foot of the hill on which their town is built. And this
<br/>because it would both furnish the teacher with an
<br/>available garden and also help to convince the <span class="">people</span>
<br/>that they might by a little industry render themselves <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independent">independ-
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>-ant</span> of those impostors called "Rain Makers". I accordingly
<br/>explained to the chief and his <span class="">principal men</span> our mode of 
<br/>irrigation and was glad to find that they were quite
<br/>delighted with the idea. The chief said he would send
<br/>as many men as it needed, if I should only shew
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>them how to do the work (two of those he sent <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">were</span> are
<br/>his principal underchiefs &amp; another <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">was</span> is his own favourite
<br/>doctor or rain maker.) I had not thought of engaging

      

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>in a work of this nature when I left <span class="">Kuruman</span> &amp; had none of the
<br/>necessary implements with me, But seeing it would not do to lose the
<br/>favourable season when all were eager to work, I commenced with
<br/>such as I could invent, Sticks sharpened to a point served for
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>digging a canal between four &amp; five hundred feet in length, three
<br/>in width, and in some places more than four in depth; the earth
<br/>was lifted out in handfuls and carried to the dam in karosses
<br/>wooden bowls and tortoise shells. This information I am quite
<br/>aware is not strictly connected with the great object for which I
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>have been sent to the <span class="">heathen</span>, But I mention these particulars
<br/>because I am by them induced to indulge the hope that they are
<br/>indicative of a better state of things among this <span class="">people</span> than
<br/>what the early missionaries found among the Batlapi, and
<br/>if so, if all the missionaries who are sent to the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>are allowed to devote their energies exclusively towards the 
<br/>amelioration of the spiritual condition of the <span class="">people</span>.
<br/>May we not hope that thereby the chariot of the everlasting
<br/><span class="">gospel</span> will go on with accelerated speed <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">untill</span> and the
<br/>whole country soon be enlightened by the glory of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Lord. ᅳ The Bakwain shewed surprising industry
<br/>and perseverence in this work, and such I conceive as
<br/>warrants me to indulge the hope I have stated above,
<br/>for although the dam was twice swept away by floods,
<br/>and I was unable, in consequence of getting both legs and
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>arms severely sunburned, to stimulate them by my
<br/>example, they did not seem in any way discouraged
<br/>but laboured on to the end.<span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span>I sincerely regret to
<br/>add that I have been unable to try the experiment whether
<br/>this favourable beginning would have continued, for in
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>consequence of great weakness the effect of a violent
<br/>fever with which the teacher I intended to leave with
<br/>them was affected, I was obliged to bring him away
<br/>and no continued efforts for the good of this interesting
<br/><span class="">people</span> are at present being made. At this period it
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>would have given me the greatest satisfaction to have
<br/>known what are the intentions of the <span class="">Directors</span> in relation
<br/>to <span class="">native</span> agency and this mission But unfortunately
<br/>no instuctions have yet arrived ᅳ</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Having remained with the <span class="">people of <span class="">Bubi</span></span> for nearly a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>month I proceeded Northward in order to visit the Bamangwato, Bakaa
<br/>and Makalaka, three tribes having their countries in Lat. 22° S.
<br/>and streching from 28° to 30° E.Long.. The last named is
<br/>the smallest of the three, but it is a section of a <span class="">people</span> of

      

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>very considerable numbers and who speak a language differing very
<br/>decidedly from the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Sitchuana</span>. More of the Bechuanas I had with me
<br/>could understand it, But from some of the words which I caught,
<br/>I am inclined to think it belongs to the same root with their Tongue
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Their manners too are somewhat different from the <span class="">Southern 
<br/>tribes</span>, inasmuch as they are not entirely dependant on the rude
<br/>Kaross for covering, but manufacture cotton cloth for <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">shal</span>
<br/>shawls &amp;c. And besides the knowledge how to manufacture iron
<br/>and copper one of the five tribes into which the Makalaka
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>are divided, called the Mashona, fight with guns, instead of
<br/>the assagai. These they obtain from the Portuguese on the
<br/>Eastern coast, and from some circumstances which have
<br/>come to my knowledge, I am inclined to believe they procure
<br/>them in exchange for <span class="">slaves</span>. By conversation with
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>many different individuals and these of different grades I
<br/>ascertained the existence of no fewer <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">tribes</span> than 28 tribes
<br/>of people hitherto unknown to <span class="">Europeans</span>, thirteen of
<br/>these are reported to have another tongue and the remainder 
<br/>speak <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Stichuana</span> But as reports cannot (however carefully
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>examined) be absolutely depended on I shall turn to
<br/>those which I myself visited ᅳ</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our route to the Bamangwato skirted the sandy desert which
<br/>flanks the <span class="">Bechuana country</span> to the <span class="">Westward</span>, and, as the sand
<br/>proved <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 3 chars, cause: ">[   ]</span></span><span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">very</span> fatiguing for the oxen, <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">so that</span> when within 40 or
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>50 miles from that <span class="">people</span>, they were unable to proceed farther,
<br/>and I had to leave both oxen and waggon and perform
<br/>my visit on foot. But I had not the least reason to
<br/>regret having done so, for the chief (<span class="">Sekomi</span>) was
<br/>evidently pleased that I had thrown myself on his bounty
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>without the least appearance of distrust. Indeed before
<br/>I had been 10 minutes in his company and while sitting 
<br/>surrounded by hundreds of his <span class="">people</span> he began to shew
<br/>his satisfaction by feeding me with the flesh of the 
<br/>Rhinoceros and some other things which they consider
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>dainties. He then took me to the house of his mother
<br/>presented me with a large <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: elephant's">elephants</span> tusk, more food, 
<br/>and, as we became better acquainted, he frequently and
<br/>emphatically exclaimed "you have come to us just like
<br/>rain". And "if you had brought your waggon I should
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>have detained you at least a month looking at you" ᅳ
<br/><span class="">Sekomi</span> has <span class="">a large number of people</span> under him,
<br/>in the town alone I numbered 600 houses which is
<br/>a number considerably larger than I have been able to count 


	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>in any other Bechuana town in the country. But they are all very small and
<br/>cannot contain many individuals each. The one in which I lived was
<br/>quite as large as any in the town and three of us could not sleep in it
<br/>without touching each other, unless we put out our fire ᅳ The
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">population</span> is sunk into the very lowest state of both mental and 
<br/>moral degradation, so much so indeed it must be difficult or 
<br/>rather impossible for <span class="">Christians</span> at home to realize anything like 
<br/>an accurate notion of the grossness of the darkness which shrouds
<br/>their minds. I could not ascertain that they had the least idea of a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>future state, and though they have some notions which seem
<br/>to us to be connected with a belief in its existence, I have not 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: met">meet</span> one who could put the necessary links together in the chain
<br/>of reasoning so as to become possessed of the definite idea,
<br/>indeed they all confess that they never think of anything connec<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>-ted with death and do not wish the introduction of that subject 
<br/>Their conceptions of Deity are of the most vague and contrad-
<br/>-ictory nature, and his name conveys no more to their 
<br/>understanding than the idea of superiority. Hence they do
<br/>not hesitate to apply the name of God to their chiefs, and I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>was every day shocked by being addressed by that title, and althoug<span class="add  above">h</span>
<br/>it as often furnished me with a text from which to tell
<br/>them of the only true God and <span class="">Jesus Christ</span> whom he has
<br/>sent; yet it deeply pained me, and I never felt so fully
<br/>convinced of the lamentable deterioration of my <span class="">species</span> before
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>It is indeed a mournful truth that "man has become like
<br/>the beasts that perish" ᅳ<span class="space" title="space: 7 chars ">              </span>The country abounds with 
<br/>lions and so much are they dreaded by the <span class="">natives</span>. one 
<br/>man never goes out alone. The women have always
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: someone">some one</span> to guard them when they go to their gardens &amp;
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>they always go in companies to draw water for the sake
<br/>of the protection which numbers give. Nor are these pre-
<br/>-cations unnecessary. For a time I could not believe but 
<br/>that they were. But the earnestness with which the chief 
<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">chode</span> with me for going a few hundred yards from the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>town unattended.: And the circumstance that he always
<br/>sent an attendant if at anytime he saw me going out
<br/>afterwards, together with the fact that a woman
<br/>was actually devoured in her garden during my visit
<br/>and that so near the town, I had frequently walked
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>far past it, fully convinced me that there are good
<br/>grounds for their fears and precautions ᅳ It was
<br/>most affecting to hear the cries of the orphan children
<br/>of this woman. During the whole day after her death

      

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>the surrounding rocks and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: valleys">vallies</span> ring and reechoed with their bitter
<br/>cries, I frequently thought as I listened to the land sobs painfully 
<br/>indicative of the sorrows of those who have no hope. that if some of
<br/>our churches could have heard their sad wailings, it would have
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>awakened the firm resolution to do more for the <span class="">heathen</span> than they
<br/>have done. <span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span>In some countries the light which the <span class="">gospel</span> once
<br/>shed has gone out and darkness has succeeded. But though
<br/>eighteen centuries have elapsed since lif<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: blotting">[ ]</span><span class="add  above">e</span> and immortality <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 3 chars, cause: ">[   ]</span></span>
<br/>were brought to light, there is no certainty that these dark region
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>were ever before visited for the purpose of making known
<br/>the light and liberty and peace of the glorious <span class="">gospel</span>. It would
<br/>seem that the myriads who have peopled these regions
<br/>have always passed away into darkness, and no ray from
<br/>heaven ever beamed on their path. And with whom
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>does the guilt rest if not with us who compose the church
<br/>militant on earth? <span class="space" title="space: 5 chars ">          </span>You will I am sure bear with 
<br/>me in this digression from my narrative for my mind
<br/>is filled with sadness when I contemplate the prospects of 
<br/>these large masses of immortal souls. I see no hopes 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>for them except in <span class=""><span class="">native</span> agents</span>. The more I see of the
<br/>country, the large extent of surface, with its population 
<br/>scattered, and each tribe separated by a formidable distance 
<br/>from almost every other, I feel the more convinced 
<br/>that it will be impossible if not impolitic for the
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>church to supply them all with <span class="">Europeans</span>: <span class="">Native</span>
<br/><span class="">Christians</span> <span class="underline ">can</span> make known the way of life. There are
<br/>some in connection with both this and the <span class="">church at
<br/><span class="">Griqua Town</span></span> who have done it effectually. Others too
<br/>are rising up who will soon be capable of teaching, and
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>if their energies are not brought into operation by
<br/>taking up the field now open before us, <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">in the <span class="">Interior</span></span>
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> see where the benevolent spirit which we 
<br/>hope is springing up among the <span class="">converts</span> of <span class="">the two 
<br/>missions</span> is to find an outlet. I conceive that
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>even now <span class="">the two missions</span> by cordial cooperation
<br/>might at once supply with <span class="">native</span> teachers all the
<br/>tribes within the range of our knowledge who are
<br/>not inimical to claims of the <span class="">gospel</span>. It would
<br/>not require more than six from each <span class="">mission</span> to
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>give two to each friendly tribe. And that this measure
<br/>or an attempt at it would be advantageous to both
<br/>churches I need not refer <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 3 chars, cause: deletion">[   ]</span> you to the effects which

                

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>increased benevolent exertions have on <span class="">churches</span> at home, and
<br/>how often it happens that when <span class="">churches</span> have <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">not</span> work set 
<br/>before them in the cause of <span class="">Christ</span> even more than they can
<br/>actually perform, their benevolence degenerates into selfish <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: quarrelling">quarreling</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>You will please to observe that I do not advance this proposition
<br/>without diffidence, for I am sensible my sentiments on account of
<br/>want of experience are entitled to much less deference than those
<br/>of others in the same field ᅳ</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I may perhaps be permitted to relate an incident which seems
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to indicate that even the darkest minds feel the need of a something to
<br/>speak peace to their troubled thoughts ᅳ On one occasion <span class="">Sekomi</span>
<br/>having sat by me in the hut for some time in deep thought, at length
<br/>addressing me by a pompous title said "I wish you would change
<br/>my heart. Give me medicine to change it for it is proud,
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>proud and angry, angry always". I lifted up the <span class="">testament</span> &amp;
<br/>was about to tell him of the only way in which the heart 
<br/>can be changed but he interrupted me by saying "Nay I
<br/>wish to have it changed by medicine, to drink it have it
<br/>changed at once, for it is always very proud and very 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>uneasy, and continually angry with <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: someone">some one</span>" He then
<br/>rose and went away. This seemed to me the more
<br/>remarkable as we had not then spoken to either him
<br/>or his <span class="">people</span> on the necessity of a change of heart ᅳ</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Another incident which also happened amongst the
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>Bamangwato gave me some encouragement to hope
<br/>that even itinerating by <span class="">native</span> <span class="">Christians</span> may by the
<br/>Divine blessing be productive of good. Late one even-
<br/>-ing as I was asleep on one side of the hut, a young
<br/>man having a most intelligent expression of count-
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>-enance came in with a present of food, and said,
<br/>"I once carried the gun of <span class="">Sepamore</span> (a <span class="">member of the church</span>
<br/>here) when he was in this country hunting ᅳ And I asked
<br/>him what he thought about God." (Here he gave me
<br/>a surprisingly correct <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">of</span> account of the Supreme
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Being.) "But" added he "What do you say?" Most 
<br/>gladly I confirmed what he had heard and added a
<br/>little more to his stock by telling him of "<span class="">Jesus</span> and 
<br/>the Resurrection" This may have been all curiosity
<br/>But it may please the Holy Spirit to operate by
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>even these small portions of truth, and lead some 
<br/>though unknown to us, into the regions of everlasting 
<br/>glory. And if so our intineracies will not be in vain

      

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>I was much gratified by the hospitality shewn by the Bamangwato to
<br/>myself and the two <span class="">natives</span> who accompanied me. We came among
<br/>them without anything to insure us a good reception, and after
<br/>living for a fortnight entirely on the bounty of the chief, When we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>left he sent 30 of his <span class="">people</span> to guard us and carry the presents he
<br/>had given to both myself and <span class="">people</span>, safely to the waggon. Four
<br/>of these he instructed to proceed with me to <span class="">Kuruman</span>, and bring
<br/>him back a faithful report of all the wonderful things I had
<br/>told him. They are, an under chief of his and three servants
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I wish and pray that I may be useful to them so that
<br/>when they return they may tell not only the strange custom<span class="add  below">s</span>
<br/>of the "<span class="">Makuas</span>" but also the "wonderful works of God."</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have finished what I had to say about the
<br/>Bamangwato, But my visit to them was not accomp-
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>-lished in one space of time. I walked to the Bakaa who
<br/>live about 24 miles <span class="">East by South</span> of <span class="">Sekomi</span>. Remained
<br/>there a few days. ᅳ proceeded to the Makalaka who lie
<br/>about 15 miles <span class="">North by West</span> of the Bakaa and then
<br/>returned to the Bamangwato. Thence after two days
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>across the sands I reached the waggon in safety ᅳ</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The Bakaa live on a very high range of dark
<br/>coloured, naked basaltic rocks. These lie close upon
<br/>the right nearly the whole way from the Bamangwato;
<br/>and when arrived opposite where the villages are built
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>we turn suddenly round and begin to ascend by a 
<br/>narrow ravine or rather cleft in the rock down
<br/>which there rushes a mountain stream. By the 
<br/>path we attain an elevation of three or four hundred feet
<br/>above the valley we have left. And enter a flat area 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>covered with trees. But have rocks rise up perpend- <br/>-icularly on all sides except at the narrow doorway by
<br/>which we entered. Directly in front the rocks
<br/>are nearly 700 feet high and on the top of them we 
<br/>now perceive perched like eagles nests the little huts
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of the Bakaa. We began to climb up towards them
<br/>and frequently looked up to see when a <span class="">crowd of
<br/><span class="">natives</span></span> should collect to gaze at our arrival. But
<br/>we were permitted to ascend in silence and when on
<br/>the top we were <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">permitted</span><span class="add  above">allowed</span> although near to the houses

<br/>was at work amongst the Bakaa, the cause I shall mention below) We
<br/>found that the curious and deep basin from which we has ascended was
<br/>but one of a great number all similarly formed. some were as large 
<br/>as <span class="">Finsbury Circus</span> , others of smaller dimensions. And the rocks as
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>a whole present the most singular appearance I ever beheld. Resemb<br/>-ling more than <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: anything">any thing</span> else I know the pews of a church on 
<br/>a gigantic scale ᅳ The rocks are rent and split in every
<br/>direction and their sides are covered by large angular blocks <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">of</span>
<br/>which have slipped down only a short distance from the places
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>whence they have been detached. In rolling or rather sliding
<br/>downwards they have impinged on each other and the rocks
<br/>below in some places where considerable rents run into 
<br/>the body of the rock, and thus form considerable cavities 
<br/>which are used by the Bakaa as retreats in time of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>danger from their <span class="">enemies</span> ᅳ The one which I entered
<br/>held nearly all the <span class="">inhabitants</span> of a village and <span class="">Mosilikatsi</span>
<br/>was completely foiled in all his attempts to destroy them.  
<br/>None of his <span class="">people</span> could enter for the entrance has
<br/>to be performed crawling on the belly and when once in a
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>dozen men could stand and defend the passage against
<br/>the ingress of one individual and he so situated ᅳ And
<br/>their attempts to suffocate them were also in vain for
<br/>the rents are so numerous the Bakaa breathed with
<br/>freedom notwithstanding the smoke ᅳ</p>

<br/>and I believe they fully deserve it<span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: ,">.</span> for a few years ago 
<br/>they destroyed, by poisoning both water and food the <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">first</span><span class="add  above">second</span>
<br/><span class="">white man</span> that ever visited them ᅳ He was a trader
<br/>and when he with two of his <span class="">people</span> fell victims to the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>treachery of the Bakaa, a fourth still lingered under the
<br/>effects of the poison. But they put a leathern thong round
<br/>his neck and finished him. They burned the waggons
<br/>in order to get the iron work <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: off">of</span> them, and devoured the 
<br/>oxen. As I happened to be the first <span class="">European</span> who has
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>visited them since this deed of darkness, their conscience,
<br/>loudly accused them, and when I came into their town,
<br/>except the chief and two attendants, the whole had fled my
<br/>presence. These were in the usual place of meeting and
<br/>in their faces they had evidences of perturbation such 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>as I never saw in black countenances before. Nothing 
<br/>I could do in the way of appearing perfectly at ease, and 
<br/>squatting down beside them, could remove the almost ludic<span class="add  below">-rous</span>

<br/>expression of fear untill they had got a dish of porridge cooked 
<br/>And when they saw me partake of it without distrust, the act 
<br/>seemed to excite their confidence ᅳ But <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">being</span> lying down to sleep
<br/>in consequence of the fatigue of the long walk seemed to have the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>full effect I desired and they soon came round me in considerable
<br/>numbers ᅳ There seemed to be something horrid in the appearance
<br/>of these <span class="">people</span>. But perhaps the impression on my mind may be 
<br/>accounted for by the fact that I saw as ornaments round their 
<br/>necks <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: pieces">peices</span> of gun locks, jin jugs &amp;c. and one had a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: piece">peice</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of sail cloth round his head which I felt sure must have
<br/>been taken from the waggon of the unfortunate <span class="">Gibson</span>
<br/>they however during the few days of my stay with them treated
<br/>me with kindness, and I had more than ordinary pleasure
<br/>in telling these murderers of the precious "blood which cleansed
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>from all sin" And I blessed God that he has conferred on 
<br/>one so worthless the distinguished <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: privilege">privelege</span> &amp; honour of
<br/>being the first messenger of mercy that ever trode these
<br/>regions. It being also the first occasion in which I had 
<br/>ventured to address a number of Bechuanas in their own
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>tongue without reading it renders it to myself one <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">occasion</span>
<br/>of peculiar interest. I felt more freedom than I had 
<br/>anticipated But I have an immense amount of labour
<br/>still before me ere I can call myself a master of Sicuana
<br/>This journey discloses to me that when I have acquired
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the Batlapi there is another and perhaps more arduous
<br/>task to be accomplished in the other dialects, But by
<br/>the Divine assistance I hope I shall be enabled to conquer.
<br/>When I left the Bakaa the chief sent his son with a
<br/>number of his <span class="">people</span> to see me safe part of the way
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>to the Makalaka. I shall not however say anything
<br/>more respecting them untill I get better acquainted with
<br/>their actual condition</p>
<br/><p class="p ">On returning to the country of <span class="">Bubi</span>, I found 16
<br/>of the <span class="">people of <span class="">Sebegwe</span></span> (g sounded gutterally) waiting my
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>arrival. He is chief of one half of the Wanketze tribe &amp;
<br/>lives nearly ten days directly west of <span class="">Bubi</span>. He was drive
<br/>into his present position in the sandy desert by <span class="">Mosilikats</span>
<br/>and there he had the address to cut off many detachments
<br/>of the <span class="">forces of that marauder</span> while all the other tribes
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>fled before them. By superior generalship he managed
<br/>to keep possession of his cattle, the others having lost theirs
<br/>are envious and having leagued together lately, purchased
<br/>a number of horses &amp; guns in order to deprive <span class="">Sebegwe</span>


	<span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<br/>of what he alone had courage to defend. In order that he might be a 
<br/>more easy prey to them they have been trying for some time to induce
<br/>him to come out of his present situation to a country near to <span class="town ">Bulei</span>,
<br/>where he can sow corn &amp;c. <span class="">Sebegwe</span> could not trust the tribes in
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>this direction for he knew that the individuals who had prepared to attack
<br/>him belong to all the <span class="">Southern tribes</span>. Even his own brother <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">Sehutsane</span></span>
<br/>chief of the other half of the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Wanketsge</span> murdered the ambassadors which
<br/><span class="">Sebegwe</span> had sent to conciliate him: The plundering expedition
<br/>was to have left this quarter during the time I was in the <span class="">Bakwani
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>country</span>. I therefore felt anxious to inform him of his danger,
<br/>and thus by doing as I should have wished to be done by perhaps
<br/>prevent much bloodshed. But I found it quite impossible to 
<br/>proceed into the desert. The sand and want of water are almost
<br/>insuperable obstacles to the traveller in that direction. <span class="">Bubi</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>however unknown to me sent off a messenger to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">Sebegwe</span></span> to
<br/>state to him my wish to see him. The result was these <span class="">people</span>
<br/>were sent to invite me to an interview in order as <span class="">Sebegwe</span> stated
<br/>that "I might speak words of truth to him" He wishes to come o<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: damage">[    ]</span>
<br/>of his present uncomfortable situation in order that his <span class="">people</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>may grow corn &amp;c. But the machinations of certain individuals
<br/>in the tribes in this direction has hitherto prevented him. He says
<br/>he would have come immediately to live with me at <span class=""><span class="">Bubi</span>'s</span>
<br/>had I intended to remain, But not knowing the intentions of
<br/>the <span class="">Directors</span> with respect to the <span class="">Interior</span> I could not invite him
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">remove</span>. So great is the impression in favour of our
<br/>superior power amongst all the <span class="">people</span> in the <span class="">Interior</span>. Each
<br/>tribe imagines if one <span class="">European</span> lived with them, they would
<br/>be quite safe. They think those who <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">I</span> conquered <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">Mosilik<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: hole">[    ]</span></span></span>

<br/>what missionaries are &amp; perhaps that was the reason
<br/>he had confidence in my veracity. He has been visited
<br/>by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> when not so far <span class="">North</span> as at present.
<br/>I am happy to be able to add that the Lord has turned the
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>counsels of those who were bent upon plundering <span class="">Sebegwe</span>
<br/>into foolishness. Many from the neighbouring tribes
<br/>have sent for horses and guns as far as to <span class="">Colesberg</span>
<br/>but all their plans have a few days ago fallen to
<br/>the ground. It is also pleasant to add that through
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>the whole although frequently enticed the <span class="">believers</span> to
<br/>a man have stood true to their principles and refused
<br/>to have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: anything">any thing</span> to do with the counsels of the wicked

<br/>With respect to the prospects for <span class="">missions</span> in the <span class="">Interior</span> I think they <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">prospects</span>
<br/>are encouraging. There is no desire to have us, but there is security for
<br/>both life &amp; property with any of all the tribes we know, and scope for
<br/>our labours provided we enter the field. Here on the outskirts we might
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>remain without the probability of being disturbed But we should not have scope
<br/>so wide as in thousands of villages in <span class="">England</span>. We must I conceive go
<br/>forward and go forward far too in order to get at the heathenism of this
<br/>country.
