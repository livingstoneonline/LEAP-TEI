<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 3 words ">                        </span>Having been disappointed in the time the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>people should leave I have time to add a few remarks to
<br/><span class="">my already lengthy epistles</span>. The most prominent topic on
<br/>my mind is an attack of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span>. The poor fellow thinks
<br/>that I have wickedly &amp; wantonly attacked him. He does not
<br/>know that I would just as soon <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">have</span> tried to perform the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>trick of <span class="">St Dunstan</span> as do any such thing. In <span class="">August of
<br/>45</span>/ he told me when I requested my account from him 
<br/>that he had sent <span class="">Rogers</span>' with it. But it never having come
<br/>he said he thought it amounted to about <span class="add  above">£</span>30 exclusive of
<br/>the food of some Bakhatla (once a day a meal of <span class="">native</span> corn)
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>As he thought this might amount to about £5 I gave a 
<br/>bill of £35 &amp; thought it was all over. A short time ago
<br/>he sent an account made up to £45..15. As I had not
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> the former I could not compare it But as there
<br/>were - a bill of £2..5..6 of which I had his own <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receipt">reciept</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>as having been paid to him once and two months boarding
<br/>which for both himself &amp; me were charged to the <span class="">Society</span> I
<br/>thought it right to ask some questions before giving
<br/>away an additional £10. The two months boarding he
<br/>stated positively to me he had charged to the <span class="">society</span> on two
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>occasions I requested to know on what principle
<br/>payment was demanded twice. He once pressed 20 lbs
<br/>of very bad beads on my acceptance &amp; said O you will give
<br/>me an equal number when our box comes. The box was
<br/>weighed at <span class="">Kuruman</span> &amp; a note taken of the weight on the spot
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>200 lbs &amp; upwards. The beads were divided &amp; a note of the division
<br/>put with my half into the box - this note shewed 88 ¾ as
<br/>my half of 200 lbs. I imagined the 11¼lbs of difference had
<br/>been taken for the 20 lbs of very inferior beads &amp; was satisfied
<br/>But finding the 20 lbs charged in this account as I had
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>furnished the half of the money I requested a sight of the
<br/>invoice. A tar bucket was presented to me by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span>
<br/>the ear of it was patched so poorly by himself before
<br/>our journey was over it broke off As it seemed an
<br/>old one &amp; a new one I had formerly got from him
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>was only charged 4/6 I demurred to paying 9/ as now  


	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>for what I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceived">concieved</span> an old one. I did not know that
<br/>teak never became old. As he was putting down his gifts
<br/>as debts I thought I might as well remind him of 10 lbs of tea
<br/>which <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E</span> distinctly borrowed from me. A cap which
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>cost me 9/ was put down at 7/6. An American
<br/>axe he borrowed &amp; never returned I put down cost price
<br/>then requested the production of the bill mentioned
<br/>in another sheet</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> the enclosed meek communication
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>lately &amp; returned the answer I likewise send for your
<br/>perusal. I am quite positive as to the <span class="">Society</span> being
<br/>charged for every iota of the expenses but as it <span class="add  above">statement</span> was
<br/>made on his own authority on the same authority 
<br/>I have to retract it &amp; beg his pardon the which
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I do very willingly as you will see. Look at the last
<br/>page &amp; you will wonder still more at my folly
<br/>in being <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: deceived">decieved</span> by such a character. <span class="">Ross</span>' conduct
<br/>was so galling to me that I was glad to have any one
<br/>to sympathize with me &amp; I allowed them to go on
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>in their slanders continuously because of the conviction
<br/>on my mind that in reference to speaking against
<br/><span class="">Ross</span> I had been just as bad as themselves.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">You will wonder that I grudge 6<span class="sup ">d</span> a day for my
<br/>board 3<span class="sup ">d</span> would more than pay all I ate &amp; my bed
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>at <span class="">Mabotsa</span> was made just once in three weeks or
<br/>once a month Did you ever hear me complain of
<br/>being illnursed in my <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">lion</span> sickness? No <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E</span> scarcely even
<br/>looked near me after the first few days &amp; to get my
<br/>arm dressed even when crawling with maggots
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>I had to send for <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> - occasionally he came of his
<br/>own accord but <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">if I had not</span> even when almost
<br/>dead I would infinitely have preferred Bakhatla to
<br/>dress it for me. It was evidently a grudge to him
<br/>&amp; how could it be otherwise he &amp; she too were writing against
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>me at the very time. Obligation on my part there is none
<br/>unless in addition to neglect I ought to feel grateful
<br/>for <span class="">native</span> corn and English corn boiled in milk

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>my stomach was well nigh ruined for ever. It is but
<br/>very recently that I got over the bad effects of their eternal 
<br/>boiled corn. Corn <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: boiled">boild</span> - Boiled corn like shovels full
<br/>of the Everlasting pills of the Antients might have ruined the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>stomachs of ostriches. O it is a blessing to be allowed to eat as
<br/>one likes I can never cease admiring the freedom
<br/>I was far too polite in most things I would not do anything
<br/>to give offence and as I tell them I believe my guilt in silent
<br/>listening to their scandals is now justly punished in what
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>they endeavour to fix on my character. If he troubles
<br/>us more we shall send his epistles back unopened
<br/>If he has never been slandered how very gratuitously wicked 
<br/>his &amp; her slanders must have been-</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We have put up the mill. It does well but it is rather inferior
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to <span class="">Hume</span>'s common mill. the latter grinds finer <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">&amp;</span> makes much less bran
<br/>so we should be glad of the large one when you have an opportunity
<br/>to send it. The trouble of sifting continually would be obviated
<br/>if we had the large mill for wheat we should try &amp; make this
<br/>the maize mill - if that can be done - some small bits of wood
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>came out of it when we tried it first so I took  down
<br/>to see from whence they proceeded. I was sorry afterwards
<br/>for <span class="">Sechele</span> was my assistant and turning it generally the backward
<br/>way he &amp; I bothered with it the whole day and failed after all
<br/>But I got a thorough knowledge of it by the labour &amp;

<br/>Dentist I was the subject operated on. The twin of that you
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>extracted became very bad one night so up we got to it. I scarified
<br/>&amp; fixed on the tooth key &amp; then the new surgeon dentist
<br/>gave a wrench &amp; I pulled her hand away in agony. It had
<br/>come out a little way I pulled &amp; pulled with a pair of
<br/>shoemaker's nippers but every pull was like a haul at
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>my entrails. On went the key again. Another wrench &amp;
<br/>I roared out "murder" It came a little farther but was still
<br/>sticking doggedly. Another trial of the nippers forceps &amp;c 
<br/>and then another effort with the key completed the first
<br/>attempt at dentistry. We were a pretty sight in our ghost<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>-ly dresses. I on the floor &amp; <span class="">Mary</span> standing over me It
