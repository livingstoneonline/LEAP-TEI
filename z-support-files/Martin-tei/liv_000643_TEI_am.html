<br/><p class="p left">My Dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p ">By the arrival of <span class="">Koulter</span> on his way southwards
<br/>we are put in possession of another opportunity to inform
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>you how we proceed in this quarter. I need not say
<br/>I do so with pleasure I only wish you may enjoy
<br/>as much in the perusal as I do in the writing. We
<br/>are all at present in tolerable health But the
<br/>setting in of the hot season seems to try our
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>stamina. <span class="">Mary</span> is troubled with shooting pains
<br/>in the chest. Had sore eyes but not severely &amp; is
<br/>now recovered - She got them from the little one
<br/>Hope we may through the Divine mercy be
<br/>favoured with health - We have so much to do 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>it seems desirable we should but we must
<br/>be resigned to the will of Him who knows what
<br/>is best for us &amp; His cause. We feel it hot now
<br/>we have plenty of Hills behind us, sufficient one
<br/>would think to screen us from the influence of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Southern icebergs - And all burning <span class="">Africa</span> spread
<br/>out before us to the <span class="">North</span> But we are within
<br/>the blessed sound of gurgling waters - they have
<br/>nightingales in <span class="">England</span> but of all the birds
<br/>in the world commend me to the merry midnight
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>frogs. You cannot <span class="">concieve</span> yes you can
<br/>how delighted we were to hear the sound of
<br/>waters at night, irrigateable water too. In
<br/><span class="">my last </span> I informed you of our removal. <span class="">Mebaloe</span>
<br/>&amp; I built huts &amp; removed into them <span class="">Paul</span> followed

<br/>&amp; is now roofing his. Your tent has done him good
<br/>service - Ours is 24 by 12, &amp; a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">pack</span> house has since
<br/>been added 10 by 12 ft, <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s 16 by 12. <span class="">Paul</span>s 
<br/>the same size as ours - the town is still in process
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of building our corner has a touch of the <span class="">European</span>
<br/>for all are square &amp; <span class="">Mebaloe</span> is thatcher to all.
<br/>Even our man Friday alias <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Morukewelo</span></span> has
<br/>got up one of the four cornered sort &amp; declares
<br/>he will never leave it it is so beautiful - our
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>plan was to get up temporary houses &amp; a temporary
<br/>meeting house as soon as possible in order that 
<br/>teaching might go on regularly during the time we
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">we</span> should be occupied in making gardens 
<br/>We have now got nearly to the point at which we
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>can with good consciences begin to labour 
<br/>for the meat which perisheth - the chief without
<br/>any suggestion from me, told me it was his desire
<br/>to build a house for God - that I should be at no
<br/>expense whatever with it - He even thought that
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>we should do nothing in the work but to this <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">latter</span> we
<br/>objected as it was for the worsh of the God of all
<br/>I think sometimes that he expects God will bless him for 
<br/>his good work - Yet he expresses himself occasionally
<br/>quite in the orthodox style. He wished to build a very
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>fine house but we cannot at present spend more 
<br/>time on it than making it a temporary affair
<br/>of pole &amp; reed - He employed all the males in cutting reed
<br/>&amp; sent them a good distance to select the straightest
<br/>woods they could find - He began it on Saturday
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>morning &amp; met in the walls on Sunday. Many
<br/>hands make light work here it was not light work
<br/>to keep them from doing too much. We made it 
<br/>40 by 15. We found they had cut the beams too short

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>for our plans &amp; rather than wait for longer put it up at
<br/>15 instead of 20. On tuesday it was finished except the closing
<br/>in at the top but the reed being deficient they have been off
<br/>cutting it today - We shall probably begin to our water cours
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>on Monday next, too late for corn but we may yet have maize
<br/>&amp; vegetables - Another proposition of the chief is that we
<br/>make an exchange of work - He takes the watercourse
<br/>&amp; we build him a <span class="">European</span> house. We are glad enough
<br/>to do this for we are but few in number. I intend
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to give a door, an old one, I may make or sell him
<br/>a window - We have lost much time in removing 
<br/>&amp; we have yet to go &amp; get the door frames &amp; <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Iron</span> in
<br/>the roof - We shall burn both school &amp; house in
<br/>order that we may pick out the nails and
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>prevent any <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boor">boor</span></span> taking up his abode therein
<br/>When we returned we found many <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boor">boor</span>s</span> on the 
<br/>place - Some were rather impudent - dogged <span class="">Paul</span>'s
<br/>wife untill she hid herself in <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s house. The latter
<br/>has more firmness than the former - All of the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boor">boor</span>s</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>made off as soon as possible after we came. I did
<br/>not shake hands with the fellows as I did when among
<br/>them in our Eastern Journey I felt like the "cock on
<br/>its ain middenhead". One gave <span class="">Sechele</span> a bottle of brandy.
<br/>their children employed the<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">ir</span> time in digging <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">license</span> &amp; ran
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>among <span class="">Paul</span>'s children as if equals. - When we came
<br/>I felt in doubt as whether it was not duty to go immediately
<br/>with <span class="">Paul</span> &amp; settle him with <span class="">Mokhatla</span>, leaving the 
<br/>removal <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">of the Bakwains</span> to another year. Since hearing of the above
<br/>named conduct I fear it might be improper. We
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>were subsequently informed that in our absence, deputies
<br/>were sent by the Bakaa &amp; Makalaka to ask our influence
<br/>with <span class="">Sechele</span> to grant them liberty to live in his
<br/>country as independent people. <span class="">Sekhome</span> is now
<br/>using them in a very tyrannical manner</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/><p class="p ">Although living in their land, since he has got guns he
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: compels">compells</span> them to pay him tribute. (I shall return to him
<br/>again) Finding us absent they did not disclose their 
<br/>object in coming publicly but informed the chiefs brother
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in private, they passed on to the Bakhatla &amp; when there
<br/>were told that I should never return, that I had fled from
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> &amp;c &amp;c. The messengers told what the Bakhatla said 
<br/>&amp; on leaving stated they would come again if the Sekoa
<br/>returned - One of the messengers is the son of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Shue</span></span> the chief of
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the Bakaa, I knew him very well. <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Shue</span></span>'s wife knows
<br/>you. The prospect of these two tribes coming nearer
<br/>made me think of forming a sort of circuit <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">north</span>
<br/>them &amp; Mokhatla &amp; keeping one of our number always
<br/>engaged among them. but present engagements
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>prevent us from doing anything but at home.
<br/>We cannot part with <span class="">Mebaloe</span> - He works so hard
<br/>he is our right hand. <span class="">Paul</span> has never been accustomed
<br/>to work but is the best theologian by far. We sent
<br/>a message to <span class="">Mokhatla</span> anent your present but he
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>has not yet made his appearance - It has been 
<br/>Hurry scurry ever since we came &amp; will be for some
<br/>time to come. I forgot to mention above that <span class="">Sechele</span> is
<br/>favourable to the approach of these tribes because they are
<br/>manufacturers in wood &amp; iron. <span class="">Sekhomi</span> monopolize
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>all the trade in front of him - He will not allow any
<br/>one to pass him Southwards - There is a good way
<br/>to the Lake but he keeps it shut as you will hear
<br/>by the <span class="">Griquas</span>. If <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: anyone">any one</span> went past him &amp; opened
<br/>up the way he would be conferring a benefit on
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the tribes beyond. When will you go to the Lake?
<br/>If you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> next season I may as a relaxation
<br/>take a trip in that direction. I should like you
<br/>to go as you have become in a manner pledged
<br/>to it - I think it would be well if first visited by

	

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>a missionary. The <span class="">Griquas</span> will certainly reach it next
<br/>season. Kañkashi is the name for the pole with
<br/>which they shove off the canoe. I cannot get the word
<br/>for the paddle whch is used after they have got into deep 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>water to Row is to hurua go hurua <span class="">Mokhoro</span> or
<br/><span class="">Mokoro</span> - go hurua ka likañkashi may perhaps <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">do</span>
<br/>the i final is distinctly sounded. Bara means to swim
<br/>the people on the Lake are great swimmers - Lekaoe
<br/>is the name given to a sort of skiff plaited together
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>&amp; made of Reed - Licobobo &amp; Litugiuana mean thicket very dense  
<br/>of both large &amp; small trees - Mopakoana a curtain - a Kaross hung
<br/>up to act as such - A dreamer of dreams is called Tlorolimpe
<br/>ki gore torolimpe. Will that do for Prognosticator - Island is
<br/>in Sekwaina Sekiri - Setlapized Seori Setlaka sa gare has always
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>reed in it but a piece of land with trees on it in a stream is
<br/>always sekiri or seori - seori can be applied to a promontory
<br/>&amp; so can setlaka sa gare but sekiri never. Koñkoñ an ignoramus
<br/>(pelu pahu, I forget at present) Matlurra rough, so is Maguata
<br/>Leposa to drawl in singing or go largely in walking But I
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>must leave words. I am glad however of the opportunity
<br/>to send out Kañkashi - As likewise a riding ox which had I
<br/>been at home I should have sent by <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high"><span class="">Boe</span></span>. I have had it three
<br/>years &amp; it has grown large in my possession - It is very tame &amp; 
<br/>is easy in riding so I think will just <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: send">sent</span> you It has some objection
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in its own mind to the stick being put into its nose but
<br/>that operation over it is as docile as possible - the boys
<br/>here chirp to him &amp; he comes out of the kraal very familiarly turning
<br/>his tail to them in order to enjoy what learned folks call titillation
<br/>I hope you will be kind enough to accept it instead of your old one
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and whatever you may say think or do with it never think of
<br/>returning it - A dear brother to whom I gave one returned it
<br/>after it had got its thigh bone broken by telling his herd that ox
<br/>belongs to <span class="">Livingston</span> - I have got a horse said to have been <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>if it dies I can get another ox. So you need not imagine I put myself
<br/>about by begging you to accept this - We had horns &amp;c for you
<br/>but all have been left at the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Letlotleñ</span> - It is now too late for

<br/>it a wolf trap - The first time a wolf got into it the animal <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">shaked</span><span class="add  above">shook</span> it
<br/>to pieces - I suspect <span class="">Evans</span> did not tell this when mentioning
<br/>how <span class="">Sechele</span> tried to cheat him. We try to obviate the objections
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>which rise up in the <span class="">heathen</span> mind by such deeds by admitting
<br/>that there are bad ones among us - At present they have a

<br/>a few days ago knocked its head off. This is the only article

<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">In riding over here from <span class="">Chonuane</span> I had the misfortune to
<br/>lose the stopper of my powder horn - could you lend me an
<br/>old one till I get one of my own.? I am now without any.
<br/>When we came here. <span class="">Sechele</span> has all his powder (about 100lbs)
<br/>in his tent. The tent was smeared with fat to make it impervious
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the floor was covered with dried grass and as he always
<br/>uses candles in the evenings. The candle stick usually
<br/>stood at the head of his bed - After drinking beer one evening
<br/>he &amp; all his attendants got up and went with the Kotla leaving
<br/>the candle burning. The wind blew it over on to the grass.
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>&amp; when the flame ran up the tent it was observed - One of my
<br/>guns being in the tent. <span class="">S.</span> ran in &amp; snatched it up - as he pushed
<br/>back the flaming tent with one hand it was severely burned
<br/>The tent was completely consumed but the powder remained
<br/>untouched it being covered over by some paties. All agreed
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>it was a great deliverance ᅳ We do not know when
<br/>we shall attain a supply of that article. We do not look for <span class="">Cumming</span>
<br/>although he has left some ivory with us. He has a <span class="">Hottentot</span>
<br/>woman with him. Got two Bakwains to accompany him
<br/>one of these having gone out to hunt with him was threatened
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>with being shot if he did not find a buffaloes spoor - the
<br/>man becoming afraid pointed out the direction in 
<br/>which he believed the animal went but <span class="">Cumming</span>
<br/>insisted it had gone another way. He then shot one of
<br/>his own dogs. told the man he should do so to him - the
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>latter again pointed out the direction in which the buffalo
<br/>went <span class="">Cumming</span> seized him by the throat - beat him with
<br/>his fists - kicked him on the abdomen &amp; then knocked him
<br/>down with the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: butt">but</span> end of his gun - this made the blood spout
<br/>out from his nose &amp; mouth. The two were alone in the field

	

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>A few days afterwards he ordered the Bakwains to let his horses &amp; cattle
<br/>alone. He then ordered one of his <span class="">Hottentots</span> to tend them - a horse
<br/>very soon fell into a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">lemena</span> - <span class="">Cumming</span> seized a molala

<br/>the deed was done. The corpse lay there till the evening and then
<br/>some of the man's friends came &amp; took it away to bury it.
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>All the people fled when they saw the man actually dead - the

<br/>they say they are returning to <span class="">ipakauya</span> so say the <span class="">natives</span>
<br/><span class="">Cumming</span> does not know of this - If he comes near the

<br/>of a blind man, &amp; asked how could they do that? It was

<br/>as the <span class="">report</span> you sent agreed exactly with appearances I

<br/>About 80 guns were washed in the morning. the discharging

<br/>for <span class="">Macuire</span> &amp; asked what harm he had done him that he
<br/>had come waiting for an opportunity to steal his cattle. Adding

<br/>any evil intention, except that of going on to some tribe
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>beyond the Bamangwato &amp; stealing what he could get
<br/>He was then asked &amp; what evil have the tribes beyond the
<br/>Bamangwato, done you. You are still eating <span class="">Sebegoe</span>s cattle
<br/>He replied he wished to buy a wagon &amp; live <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independent">independant</span> of

<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>but fear operated to prevent him getting any. the Mauketse

<br/>to plunder was within a little of leaving his bones among us
<br/>We thank him who watched over us &amp; shielded us from
