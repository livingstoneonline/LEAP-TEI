<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear <span class="">Waller</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">I wrote you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>last month but a 
<br/>short note as I was 
<br/>not very well and 
<br/>soon hoped to be down 
<br/>to you - I got a slight 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>sunstroke in coming 
<br/>home and have had 
<br/>a constant singing 
<br/>in the Ears &amp; deafness
<br/>ever since — It became 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>worse at times and 
<br/>indisposes me for 

     

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>writing of which I have 
<br/>a great deal to do. 
<br/>In a note sent at the 
<br/>same time to the bishop 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in answer to an offer 
<br/>to help from private 
<br/>means in <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">aiding</span> the 
<br/>women &amp; children I 
<br/>told him that I had doubts 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>about taking them to 
<br/><span class="">Johanna</span> though had 
<br/>the boys been free 
<br/>I would have sent all to 
<br/>the <span class="">Cape</span> — and some 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>would no doubt be 
<br/>taken up by <span class="">Bishop 
<br/>Gray</span>. As it was 
<br/>I thought it might

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>be best to arrange with 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Ferraõ</span> for food for 
<br/>a season but all this 
<br/>was on the supposition 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>that the <span class="">mission</span> was  
<br/>to continue.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> a letter by 
<br/><span class="">Blair</span> in which the 
<br/>Bishop says that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he had kept you 
<br/>for nearly three months 
<br/>according to a previous 
<br/>arrangement and 
<br/>now he will be glad 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to hear that <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">"</span> I "am taking 
<br/>steps to place <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Waller</span>
<br/>in an independent 
<br/>position with respect 
<br/>to the <span class="">mission</span>"

     

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>He says also that he 
<br/>strongly disapproved of 
<br/>your plans - and also 
<br/>that he concludes from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>an extract from <span class="">one 
<br/>of my letters</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">to you</span> that you 
<br/>are carrying out my 
<br/>wishes — It is a regular 
<br/>bit of law, and is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>written on a separate 
<br/>sheet of same date as 
<br/>another letter on general 
<br/>subjects — not a word 
<br/>about the boys sent 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>away — This I reject 
<br/>for I cannot trust 
<br/><span class="">Blair</span> - <span class="">Wikatani</span>
<br/>and two others came 
<br/>up &amp; offered to take 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>him — He seemed to agree</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><p class="p ">My answer amounts 
<br/>to this — You took the 
<br/>boys as I understood 
<br/>to instruct them — I depart 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to the <span class="">Lake</span> &amp; returning 
<br/>heard with regret that 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Waller</span> had been separated 
<br/>from the <span class="">Mission</span> —  it 
<br/>never entered my head 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that any objection 
<br/>could be made to a 
<br/>member of the <span class="">mission</span> 
<br/>becoming a vehicle 
<br/>of christian benevolence 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to poor people living  
<br/>in the vicinity of 
<br/>the station</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I tell him also that 
<br/>on hearing of his

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>The captives attached to 
<br/><span class="">mission</span> by <span class="">Bishop 
<br/>Mackenzie</span> I at once 
<br/>offered to provide for 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>them &amp; send them to the 
<br/><span class="">Cape</span> — — He knew that 
<br/>then why throw the 
<br/>six boys among 
<br/><span class="">heathen</span> Ajawa who 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>will sell them by the 
<br/>first opportunity —
<br/>I also request him 
<br/>to hand over the 
<br/>remainder of the boys 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to me and I shall still 
<br/>send them to the <span class="">Cape</span>
<br/>the sentence about 
<br/>you is as follows</p>

<br/><p class="p ">With respect to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span>
<br/>Waller</span> it would be

<br/>think the bishop will 
<br/>venture on refusing
