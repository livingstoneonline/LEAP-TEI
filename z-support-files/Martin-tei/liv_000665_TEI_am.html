<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>As the last intends to make this his farthest point Northward &amp; will turn round
<br/>on Monday I begin to think of what I may have to say to <span class="">our southern
<br/>friends</span> and first of all we must as the <span class="">Directors</span> say present our
<br/>acknowledgements for sundries <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> viz. Herrings - they deserved 
<br/>to be sent whither most of them have now gone with at least a
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>good character. We all liked them, this all including the two old people
<br/><span class="">Robert Manee</span> &amp; the one who is still on the road home for <span class="">Mary</span> felt
<br/>greatly the better of one for breakfast. The apples came in good order
<br/>&amp; were very welcome - sorry to see the tail end of them. mill locks
<br/>&amp;c &amp;c all in good condition &amp; everything else so far as I remember.
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>The safety with which these articles came puts me in mind of an
<br/>annoyance about which I forgot to write last time. though after all
<br/>I question whether you can do anything to prevent it. Most of the
<br/>boxes which come to us from <span class="">England</span> are opened &amp; usually lightened
<br/>of their contents. You will perhaps remember one in which <span class="">Sechele</span>'s
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: cloak">cloack</span></span> was.. It contained on leaving <span class="">Glasgow</span> besides the articles which
<br/>came here a parcel of surgical instruments which I ordered &amp; of course
<br/>paid for - one of these was a valuable cupping apparatus in which
<br/>the air was exhausted by a small air pump previous to being applied
<br/>to the part to be operated upon. At the price which medical men <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>these instruments it was £2.12. - scalpels &amp;c at the same terms
<br/>amounted to about £2. They were purchased for me by a medical
<br/>gentleman. Their real value was of course much more than the
<br/>above sums. We think too there were some dresses for <span class="">Mary</span> in it
<br/>and a magic lantern. The box which you kindly packed for us
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and dispatched for <span class="">Glasgow</span> has we hear been gutted by the <span class="">Custom
<br/>House</span> thieves, &amp; only a few very plain Karosses left in it. When
<br/>we see a box which has been opened we have not half the
<br/>pleasure we should otherwise have unpacking it. I ordered some
<br/>things from <span class="">Glasgow</span> lately but could not tell to whom they ought to
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>be consigned at <span class="">Algoa Bay</span>. Has <span class="">our society</span> any agent there now?
<br/>&amp; do you know whether an invoice sent to an agent would
<br/>prevent the lids being wrenched off as we have had in two cases

       

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>I requested my friends to apply to the secretary for information as to whom they
<br/>ought to send. Can you give me any information as to how the annoyance
<br/>may be prevented. or must we submit as to one of the crooked things of this
<br/>life which <span class="">Solomon</span> tells us cannot be made straight</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="add  inline">Here begin</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">Paul</span> &amp; I went lately in order to erect a temporary building at <span class=""><span class="">Mokhatla</span>'s</span>
<br/>in which he might place his family. We found <span class="">Potgeiter</span> close by and
<br/>somewhat opposed to our work from an idea that we had come to take
<br/>possession of the land for the <span class="">English Gov<span class="sup underline ">t</span></span> We could scarcely get an
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>opportunity to reason with him on the absurdity of this supposition for
<br/>an individual from <span class="">Holland</span> whom I take to be a <span class="">Jesuit</span> would scarcely
<br/>allow us to speak three words without screaming out at the top of his
<br/>voice that missionaries were like a cancer &amp; ought to be shot
<br/>&amp; a thousand other things which perhaps happily for me I did not under-
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>-stand. Our friend <span class="">Pretorius</span> told me in private that the Hollander was a 
<br/>strange fellow - whom no one understood - or knew anything of. Among
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> I observed him always with the <span class="">bible</span> lecturing them &amp; when
<br/>I came near <span class="">Potgeiter</span> he always took it upon himself to answer me
<br/>and with so much energy the foam gathered at the corners of his
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>mouth. In the evening we had a conference with <span class="">Potgeiter</span>
<br/>&amp; <span class="">Pretorius</span> alone. the former told me that the land was his he
<br/>had conquered it &amp; intended to remove <span class="">Mokhatla</span> from his present
<br/>situation to the <span class="">Limpopo</span> &amp; all our labour would be in vain
<br/>if we erected a school in the present locality. I felt very unwilling    
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to defer our commencement for all their violent speeches seemed first
<br/>to give me the go by. But threatenings to bring a commando against
<br/><span class="">Mokhatla</span> &amp; not spare us in it seemed to say our labour would
<br/>be in vain for they would probably burn what we erected. I put it
<br/>to <span class="">Potgeiter</span> that if he hindered the <span class="">gospel</span> the guilt of the loss of many
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>souls would rest on his head. this tickled the old gentleman dreadfully
<br/>Ké ké ké ké he tried to speak but the words stuck fast at Adam's
<br/>apple. After saying he did not expect such a word from me he called
<br/>on <span class="">Pretorious</span> - (our friend) to answer me &amp; he did so by recounting
<br/>all <span class="">Potgeiters</span> good deeds. I repeated the sentiments as the truth 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>but the present state of feeling amongst them of which by the bye we
<br/>had no idea when we went made me conclude that proceeding at
<br/>that time with our plans would entail misery on <span class="">Mokhatla</span>. We
<br/>heard two days afterwards that two clergymen from the <span class="">Colony</span> had 
<br/>come to <span class=""><span class="">Gert Kruger</span>'s</span> to hold a service as it was only two
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>days off we went to see them &amp; secure their influence on our
<br/>side. there was a goodly company of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> &amp; <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boeresses">boeresses</span></span> there

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>operators on the occasion. Seeing a great burly <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boer">boer</span></span> dressed in black coming
<br/>out of the place of meeting &amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span> the homage of his neighbours, I presumed
<br/>he was the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: predicant">prediccant</span> &amp; introduced myself in English. He answered in <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Dutch">dutch</span>
<br/>and after ascertaining that I lived beyond the sphere of <span class=""><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">European</span></span> <span class="add  above">colonial</span> news told
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>me he was the commandant <span class="">Pretorious</span>. the Kwade doer of the English -
<br/>Our <span class="">Jesuit</span> friend was also there &amp; striving to stir up the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> against me
<br/>Having found <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Robertson</span> &amp; made known as much as the bustle of
<br/>writing down names for <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Hoopeiy</span> or whatever else they call it would
<br/>allow. He seemed very friendly, knew you, shook hands with
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Paul</span> at which the <span class="">Boer</span> stood astonished. He spoke to <span class="">Chevi</span> &amp;
<br/><span class="">Potgeiter</span> on our affair. both declared as they have always done their
<br/>desire to further the <span class="">gospel</span> by all means in their power but the
<br/>state of feeling among their people was such that they could not
<br/>guarantee our safety if we <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: built">builded</span> now - requested us to go
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>on itinerating as usual untill they had brought forward the subject
<br/>before their people and, as their minds were decidedly favourable
<br/>&amp; should be expressed so. we should have a greater probability of permanence
<br/>they mentioned the violent opposition of some of their people to
<br/>missionaries as a reason for caution. <span class="">Chevi</span> however called
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Mogale</span> away next morning when he must have know I wished <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">to</span>
<br/>a meeting with the people &amp; I could not hold one. I may however
<br/>in this be wrong - the people are completely in the power of the
<br/><span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>. Great numbers have come from the southward &amp; taken
<br/>possession of the whole country &amp; every one must be served
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>by the <span class="">natives</span>. A larger share of the drudgery falls on <span class="">Mokhatla</span>
<br/>than on anyone else. Many of them said to us we wish you
<br/>would come &amp; live here. perhaps the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> would let us alone a little
<br/>You will be able to gather from the above our prospects in the <span class="">Eastward</span> -
<br/>I think it will be our duty after <span class="">Mary</span>'s confinement to take <span class="">Paul</span> &amp; family
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>over &amp; make another effort. If they drive us away then the guilt will
<br/>rest on their heads. I do not feel satisfied that all has been done
<br/>we can do untill they do more than mere threatening. If repelled then
<br/>we can turn our attention somewhere else. But that is certainly
<br/>a fine missionary field. You will remember it in your prayers
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>that the kingdom of <span class="">Christ</span> may be advanced</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Since we have come home we have been building <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s
<br/>house But before leaving the <span class="">East</span> I may mention that the French
<br/>missionaries sometime ago sent five <span class="">native</span> teachers to the Bamapela
<br/>tribes. they were directed to go to to <span class="">Mokhopane</span> or <span class="">Secoamari</span>. Had a
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>letter for <span class="">Chevi</span> or perhaps for the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> in general but <span class="">Chevi</span> tore it
<br/>up &amp; threw it into the fire &amp; took their guns from them

       

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>they entreated him to give back their guns &amp; he gave them two &amp; kept one - &amp; sent
<br/>them back. <span class="">Mokhatla</span> told me of it &amp; added the missionaries sent me an old file
<br/>I wondered they should send an old thing to one they did not know - the <span class="">Bishop
<br/>of Capeton</span> said in a public meeting in <span class="">England</span> he intended to go beyond other
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>men's line of things <span class="add  above">with his mission</span>. Why does he not send his missionaries to the tribes still
<br/>farther <span class="">Eastward</span> or rather <span class="">Northward</span> than the <span class="">Caffres</span>. <span class="">Kamenyana</span> - <span class="">Pelanie</span>s
<br/>son is an <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: agreeable">agreable</span> youth - very friendly &amp; has a large tribe. We had good
<br/>meetings there for the first time also at <span class=""><span class="">Mabe</span>'s</span> &amp; <span class=""><span class="">Khotlamashne</span>'s</span>
<br/>I have a very great desire that the <span class="">gospel</span> be tried at <span class=""><span class="">Mokhatla</span>'s</span> the proposition
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that <span class="">Paul</span> should come &amp; teach him was entirely his own and a station
<br/>there although <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> have taken possession of the country might be a blessing
<br/>to very many for he is situated among thousands. He began to collect
<br/>his people into one town but the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> foiled him. He had a stool
<br/>&amp; <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> objected to him using it. "You'll be thinking you are a man"
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>We have no hope for success but in the almighty power of God.
<br/>We did not intend to go near the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> when we went but <span class="">Potgeiter</span> being
<br/>near &amp; sending for me to take the latitude for him (which not having
<br/>my sextant I could not do) seemed like being led to them. If any
<br/>one feels disposed to blame me for doing too little or too much or doing
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>what I did wrong I can only say I wish they may do better - the French
<br/>might have succeeded better if they had come with the teachers they sent
<br/>I should not like to see <span class="">Mokhatla</span> taken from us but should not grumble
<br/>if the <span class="">gospel</span> were introduced no matter by whom We earnestly hope these
<br/>people may be given to the <span class="">Bechuana Mission</span>. <span class="add  inline">/</span> <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, hand: #U; type: strikethrough; ">Fell glad you succeed so

<br/>I entertained the same views respecting <span class="">Helmore</span>'s labours as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs M</span></span>. expresses long
<br/>ago but felt disappointed in him when he turned off from <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Bongeling</span> in the way
<br/>he did. His houses will bear comparison with any in the country where no trades<br/>-man <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">as builder or carpenter</span> has been employed &amp; even some of the taught as <span class="">Father Ross</span> might take a

<br/>subject to my mind &amp; which might with profit be resolved in <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M</span>'s mind
<br/>When I visited them about 4 years ago the people were all either professing <span class="">Christians</span>
<br/>or wishing to be so - He states that religion was quite fashionable - I suppose
<br/>it is so still but many no doubt have been guided to true faith in Christ
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Would more good not have been done had he taken to a <span class="">heathen</span> tribe <span class="addmargin"> [<span class="">Jan 1849</span>] </span>
<br/>rather than to an outstation of an established mission. this point is
<br/>interesting in reference to the permanence of the churches raised up in this
<br/>country. I am not now to be understood as speaking of <span class="">Helmore</span> in
<br/>particular but should like to know whether the nursing the people
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>of <span class="">Likatlong</span> have got has tended to strengthen or weaken Sometimes I
<br/>believe the former sometimes the latter. What do you think? the
<br/>squall raised by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Elliot</span> may elicit something worth knowing</span></p>
