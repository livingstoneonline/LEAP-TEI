<br/><p class="p center">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 6 words ">                                                </span>The excessive heat and dust which
<br/>prevail previous to the commencement of the rainy season, have
<br/>prevented my departure from the <span class="">town of <span class="">Sekeletu</span></span> as I intended
<br/>at the beginning of this month, in order to descend the <span class="">Leeambye</span>
<br/>or <span class="">Zambesi</span>. And though often seized with sore longing for the end
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of this pilgrimage, the certainty that the present weather would soon
<br/>lay me up with fever at a distance from friends almost reconciles
<br/>the mind to the delay. As I now possess considerable knowledge
<br/>of the region to which I have devoted some years of toil, I will
<br/>employ my present comparative <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: leisure">leizure</span> in penning a sort of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">report</span> which may enable you to form a clear idea of <span class="">intertropical
<br/><span class="">Africa</span></span> as a missionary field.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">It may be advantageous to take a glance at the physical
<br/>features of the country first, in order to be able to appreciate the
<br/>nature of the obstacles which will <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">have to</span> be surmounted by those whom
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>God may honour to introduce christianity into this large section
<br/>of the <span class="">heathen</span> world The remarks made for this purpose must be
<br/>understoo as applying exclusively to the country between 18º and 10º
<br/>South Latitude, and situated towards the centre of the continent. The
<br/>region thus indicated may be described as an extensive plain, intersected
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in every direction by large rivers with their departing and re-entering
<br/>branches. They bear on their bosoms volumes of water such as
<br/>are totally unknown in the <span class="">South</span>. And never dry up as the <span class="">Orange</span>
<br/>and most <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">other</span> <span class="">African</span> rivers do. They appear as possessing two beds,
<br/>one of inundation, and another cut out <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">in that</span> exactly like the <span class="">Clyde</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>above <span class=""><span class="">Bothwell</span> bridge</span>. They overflow annually during the rainy
<br/>season in the <span class="">North</span>. &amp; then the beds of inundation - the haughs or
<br/>holms, are all flooded though as in the <span class="">Barotse valley</span> they may
<br/>be more than 20 miles broad. The main body of the water still
<br/>flows in the now very deep low water bed - but the rivers look
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>more like chains of Lakes than streams. The country between this
<br/>and <span class="">Sesheke</span> was during the present year nearly all under water
<br/>The parts which remained dry are only a few feet above the general
<br/>level - and canoes went regularly from <span class="">Linyanti</span> to <span class="">Sesheke</span>, the
<br/>distance being in a straight line more than 120 miles. It was
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>an unusually wet year and the plains are not yet free from
<br/>large patches of stagnant foul smelling water, though we expect
<br/>the rains of another season to begin during the present month.
<br/>The inundation, if I may judge from my own observation, is by
<br/>no means partial. The exceptions are where outcropping rocks
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>form high banks and there we have rapids and cataracts

       

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>which impede navigation and have probably always been the
<br/>barriers to inland trade. When the supply of water from the <span class="">North</span>
<br/>diminishes, the rivers are confined to the low water channels and
<br/>even at their lowest are deep enough to prevent invasion by
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">enemies</span> who cannot swim or manage canoes. Numerous
<br/>Lakes of considerable size are left on the lately flooded meadows by
<br/>the retiring rivers, and these are either fringed with reeds or covered
<br/>with mat rushes - Papyrus plants - the Egyptian Arum - the Lotus and
<br/>other waterloving plants. They are always drying up but never dry
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>ere the next wet season begins</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The country over which the rivers never rise is rarely 200 feet
<br/>higher than the holms. More frequently it is under 100 feet. In many
<br/>parts there are plains so level the rain water stands for months
<br/>together 6 or 8 inches deep. We waded <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> some upwards of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>twenty miles broad and fish, otters and water tortoises appeared
<br/>in numbers and quite at home among the grass bushes &amp; trees.
<br/>These peculiarities result in a great measure from the form of
<br/>that part of the continent to which our attention is directed
<br/>It appears to be of a basin or trough form - the hollow is
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>much more elevated certainly than the sea but it is considerably
<br/>depressed in reference to two longitudinal ridges or fringes on
<br/>its <span class="">Eastern</span> and <span class="">Western</span> sides. I was led to the recognition
<br/>of this fact by contemplating the <span class="">Lotembua</span> running in two
<br/>and nearly opposite directions. Parting at the <span class="">Lake <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Dilalo</span></span> the
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Northern</span> portion is discharged into the <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Casai</span></span> and thence into the
<br/><span class="">Atlantic</span> by the <span class="">Congo</span>. The <span class="">Southern</span> half disembogues into the
<br/><span class="">Leeba</span> and thence into the <span class=""><span class="">Indian</span> Ocean</span> by the <span class="">Zambesi</span>. The
<br/>boiling point of water shewed this takes place at the highest part
<br/>of the basin. It is a sort of partition in it and both <span class="">North</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and <span class="">South</span> of it all the feeders of the great draining rivers flow
<br/>from both <span class="">Eastern</span> and <span class="">Western</span> ridges towards the centre of
<br/>the continent. The general direction of the ranges of hills and
<br/>the stratification of the rocks dipping down towards a central basin
<br/>now much filled up by eruptive rocks I had noticed many
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>years ago, and information <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> from <span class="">Arabs</span> of two
<br/>Large shallow lakes within the <span class="">Eastern</span> ridge make me wonder
<br/>I did not recognize what seems so self evident now. I advance
<br/>the view to you now with the less diffidence inasmuch as
<br/>I have just <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">now</span> ascertained by the perusal of a speech of <span class="">Sir
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>R. Murchison</span> before the <span class="">R.Geog.Soc.</span> that he promulgated the
<br/>same idea so long ago as <span class="">1852</span>. I cannot imagine how he
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> that information but from his eminent scientific attainments
<br/>it is certain to be from a reliable source. And as I reached the
<br/>conclusion from <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independent">independant</span> but very <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">jogtrot</span> observation, the
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>view of that gentleman is surely correct.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I may have dwelt too long on the foregoing topic, but
<br/>you will at once <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: perceive">percieve</span> it has a most important bearing

      

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>on our prospects. The great humidity produced by quick evaporation
<br/>from such a vast expanse of water and marsh - the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: exuberant">exhuberant</span>
<br/>vegetation caused by fervid heat and a perfect flood of light in a rich
<br/>moist soil. And the prodigious amount of decaying vegetable
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>matter annually exposed after the inundations to the fervid rays
<br/>of the torrid sun, with a flat surface often covered with forest,
<br/>and little wind except at one season of the year, all combine to
<br/>render the climate far from salubrious for any portion of
<br/>the human family. I really do not desire to deepen those dark
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>colours in which the climate of certain parts of <span class="">Africa</span> have been <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: portrayed">pourtrayed</span>
<br/>But in dealing even prospectively with that <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: sacred">sarced</span> thing human life,
<br/>it is necessary to be conscientiously explicit. Take the experience
<br/>of the Makololo who are composed of Basutas, Bakwains and the
<br/>Bamangwato. They came from a dry climate, than which there
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>are few more salubrious in the world. They have not been
<br/>20 years in this quarter but so great has been the mortality among
<br/>the men the tribe presents all the appearance of being destined at
<br/>no distant day to extinction. I have heard <span class="">Sebituane</span> (<span class="">Sebitane</span>
<br/><span class="">his own people</span> call him) and many others complain of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>numbers of children who have been cut off by fever. The women
<br/>are less fruitful than formerly and ascribe the difference to the
<br/>excessive operation of a natural phenomenon <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: deletion">[      ]</span> produced
<br/>by the climate. This may explain why they are generally less subject
<br/>to fever than the men. The Barotse, Batoka, Bashikia &amp;c. who
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>belong to the true <span class="">negro</span> race now constitute the body of the tribe
<br/>Then who can boast of being pure Makololo. We considered the    
<br/><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: illegible">[  ]</span>istocracy &amp;c are a mere handful - the <span class="">negroes</span> differ from the Bechuanas
<br/><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">in</span> being very prolific. Every village we entered in the <span class="">North</span> swarmed
<br/>with children. This perhaps explains why notwithstanding all their
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>wars, kidnapping, <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> selling</span> and mortality by fever. they are
<br/>such an imperishable race. I supposed the mortality to be
<br/>considerable among them because many with whom we formed
<br/>acquaintanceship in going North were in their graves when we returned.
<br/>But we saw many aged men there.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><p class="p ">Having given the dark side of the picture first the impression
<br/>may have been produced that it can have no other. Before deciding
<br/>let me try and give the brighter phase as fairly. No one seeing the
<br/><span class="">country around <span class="">Linyanti</span> or <span class="">Sesheke</span></span> could form an idea of what
<br/>it becomes further <span class="">North</span>. The <span class="">Southeast portion</span> is the least desirable
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>of the whole. For when we go beyond the <span class="">Barotse</span> the land gradually
<br/>becomes more lovely untill in <span class="">Londa</span> (<span class="">Lunda</span>) we reach an exceedingly
<br/>well watered fruitful country. It is flat, but the luxurient
<br/>loveliness of many a spot will remain in my imagination for<br/>ever. As for the <span class="">Interior of <span class="">Angola</span></span> if <span class="">Eden</span> sent up so quickly
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>such a rush of rank vegetation our progenitor must have found
<br/>sufficient occupation in dressing it. The very thing to be dreaded</p>
	<p class="ab ">
<br/>It is necessary to qualify their experience a little in view of the general practice of smoking
<br/>the Cannabis Sativa which in the form of hackshisch is nearly as injurious as opium among the Turks

This is
<br/>from the decay of a hundred thousand organisms every one of which <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">is</span> beautiful
<br/>But the <span class="">London</span> <span class="">Directors</span> surely have not been such unprofitable hearers of
<br/>sanitary sermons, as to forget that they inhale perennially, effluvia, miasmata,
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>poison! from millions of things almost everyone of which is too horrible to
<br/>name.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The fever is certainly the great bugbear of this field. But it must
<br/>ever be borne in mind that it is the only one. There are few other
<br/>diseases. No consumption, nor scrofula, nor madness *. <span class="addmargin"> [<span class="vertical "><span class="note  ">3 cases of mania, one of puerpural insanity &amp; one of senile dementia in 15 years do not require notice in a general statement</span></span>] </span>Measles
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and smallpox paid a passing visit some twenty years ago (singularly
<br/>enough inoculation was employed in the latter disease.) I have seen but
<br/>one well marked case of hydrocephalus, three of epilepsy but none
<br/>of cholera, cancer or hydrophobia. <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">or delirium themeus</span> and many other diseases common     
<br/>in <span class="">England</span>. "Silent friends" et id genus omne, would here have light
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>purses. The paucity of complaints renders people less gullible than with
<br/>you. A person is very rarely suspected of malingering, and though we
<br/>have the most implicit faith in medicine homeopathy never alters
<br/>nor alleviates a single symptom. Indeed  Odyle, <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Table</span>, <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Twinny</span>, popular
<br/>mesmerism are all the accomplishments of high civilization. The only

<br/>violent action of the voluntary muscles. The individual pretending to the prophetic
<br/>afflatus. The application or even threatened application of that which is
<br/>recommended for the backs of children and fools produces instantaneous
<br/>return to propriety. The most common diseases are inflammations
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of different organs but neither these nor fever should form a
<br/>barrier to missionary enterprise. I imagine they will not for those
<br/>who wished to engage therein have never yet stipulated for a field
<br/>in which death has absolutely no deaths in his quiver. I hope I am
<br/>not estimating the prospect of subjection to frequent attacks of fever
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>too lightly for should missionaries who are educated and sent out
<br/>at great expense be cut off as soon as they enter on their labours
<br/>by causes which might have been foreseen and avoided, great losses
<br/>would be sustained by both the church and world. But can any
<br/>unfavourable inference be drawn from my personal experience in
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>respect of fever? I believe decidedly not. It is true I suffered severe
<br/>attacks of the disease no fewer than twenty seven times in the space of
<br/>2½ years, but it will readily be confessed that sleeping month after
<br/>month with only a little grass and a horsecloth between me and the ground
<br/>emitting so much moisture; dew is deposited so quickly on the glass
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>roof of the artificial horizon if placed on a box and within it if placed
<br/>on the trough on the ground. It is extremely difficult to observe the stars -
<br/>exposure in comparative motion to the hot sun by day in a temp<span class="sup underline ">e</span>

<br/>of animals fed on pure gluten or amylaceous matter only. No ulcer was
<br/>actually formed but this I attribute to being occasionally able to procure
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>a fowl and some maize - these constitute rather a pitiful hygiene
<br/>and few who follow will have to endure the like. These privations
<br/>I beg you to observe are not mentioned as if I considered them
<br/>in the light of <span class="underline ">sacrifices</span>. I think the word ought never to be mentioned
<br/>in reference to anything we can do for Him who though he was rich
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>yet for our own sakes became poor. But I supposed you could not
<br/>well appreciate my experience at its true or rather no value, unless
<br/>I stated the drawbacks to fair treatment of the animal economy I
<br/>came into collision with. No unfavourable opinion surely can
<br/>be formed from mine as to what the experience of one less exposed
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to the vicissitudes of the weather and change of diet, might be. I
<br/>beg that in the event of publication the parts marked by a line on
<br/>the margin may be suppressed. Unless I mentioned privately the foregoing
<br/>circumstances it might be supposed I was speaking too lightly of a
<br/>disease which has inspired so much terror</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p ">The fever may be said to commence at the Latitude of <span class="">Lake

That terrible disease seems to baffle all medical means - I believe it occasionally becomes epidemic in the country mentioned. I have seen a few mild cases - yet in the intervals we have a more salubrious field than the church, <span class="">Baptist American</span> &amp; <span class="">United Presbyterian</span> missionaries</span></span>] </span>
<br/>The sequelae of this are enlargement of the spleen and great emaciation
<br/>which after a considerable period end fatally. Abundant <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">warning</span> is
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>always given to seek cure by change of climate and we have not far to
<br/>go, for a few  degrees of southing introduces into the dry, pure air of the
<br/>desert and every step in that direction is made in the very remarkably
<br/>healthy tract termed the <span class="">Interior of Southern Africa</span>. I have had the
<br/>complaint in its severest forms and, when checked by exposure during
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>its course vomiting of large quantities of blood ensued, yet I am aware:-
<br/>of no organic affection as the result. Indeed I am as well now as ever
<br/>I was in my life. The greatest inconvenience I was subjected to was
<br/>being less energetic or quite useless for long periods as a missionary.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">One cause of the great mortality which prevails at certain times and
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>particularly at the period of drying up of the inundations is the want
<br/>of prompt though not heroic treatment. Neither doctors nor patients
<br/>hurry themselves. Though his services may not have been asked till danger
<br/>appears, the medical man must throw his dice first and spend hours
<br/>of talking over that, then if it is late in the afternoon he will go and dig
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>the roots tomorrow, and even then stirs not till the sun is well up. The
<br/>treatment when once fairly in operation is undoubtedly that best adapted
<br/>to overcome the disease for they set themselves assiduously to induce profuse
<br/>and long continued action of the skin. By a combination of this <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">and</span> with
<br/>simultaneous but gentle stimulation of the internal organs which as well
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>as the skin have ceased secretion, I have found no difficulty in relieving
<br/>and ultimately curing every case submitted to my care. My <span class="">company of
<br/>27 persons</span> were often attacked. (two of them being jaundiced appeared as if
<br/>affected by something of the <span class="">West African</span> remittent) but all were brought
<br/>home in good health. With an equal number of <span class="">Europeans</span> it might
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>have been otherwise. But I apprehend no great mortality among missionaries

<br/>and this too though the <span class="">Recorder</span> of the district declares that history does not
<br/>present an instance in which so great security for life and property has
<br/>been enjoyed. The killing modesty of the colony <span class="">bravadoes</span> becomes evident
<br/>when you see the men who say, "I would drive the 100,000 over the border by
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>force". "I would make a law to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: compel">compell</span> them to give their <span class="">young men</span>
<br/>to us to labour" described by another of the examined, as "generally men
<br/>who came to the country in search of employment themselves". They cannot
<br/>now dig but to beg for enrichment by a <span class="">Caffre</span> war they are not ashamed.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In regard to the people inhabiting this large and populous territory
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it is difficult in the absence of all numerical data to present a very precise
<br/>idea. The tribes are large but divided into a great number of villages
<br/>so thickly were these dotted over the country that in travelling in a straight
<br/>line in which we could rarely see more than a mile on each side we
<br/>often passed ten or twelve hamlets in a single day. Occasionally however
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>we marched 10 miles without seeing any. In no part of the <span class="">South</span> I have
<br/>visited is such a population seen. <span class="">Angola</span> contains 600000 souls
<br/>and <span class="">Londa</span> seemed more populous and of larger extent than it.
<br/>The <span class="">Cape Colony</span> with 200000 souls, possesses some hundreds of mission-
<br/>-aries and other <span class="">Christian instructors and schoolmasters</span>, but it will
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>bear no comparison with <span class="">Londa</span> as a missionary field. The <span class="">Makololo
<br/>territory</span> has several tribes <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">of</span> Batoka, Barotse, Bashubia, Banyeti
<br/>Matlotlera &amp;c. and there is no impediment to immediate occupation 
<br/>by missionaries and to such as aspire to the honour of being
<br/><span class="">messengers of mercy</span> to the actual <span class="">heathen</span> there is no more inviting
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in <span class="">South Africa</span>. I am not to be understood as meaning that any
<br/>of these people are anxious for the <span class="">gospel</span> - they are quite unlike the
<br/>intelligent, enquiring <span class="">race in the <span class="">Punjaub</span></span>, or the vivaceous <span class="">islanders
<br/>of the <span class="">Pacific</span></span>. But there is not such callous indifference to religious
<br/>truth as I have seen. nor yet that opposition which betokens
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>progress in knowledge. But there is a large population and we are
<br/>sure if the word of life is faithfully preached, in process of time
<br/>many will believe. I repeat again that I know of no impediment
<br/>to immediate efforts for their instruction. Every headman and
<br/>chief in the country would be proud of the visit or residence of a
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="">white man</span>. There is security generally for life and property. I left by
<br/>mistake a pontoon in a village of <span class="">Londa</span> and found it safe 18
<br/>months afterwards. Some parcels sent by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> by means
<br/>of Matibele lay a whole year on an island in the <span class="">Zambesi</span> near
<br/><span class="">Mosioatunya</span>. It is true, it was believed that they contained medicine
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>which might bewitch but regular rogues are seldom scared by such
<br/>preservatives, the Balonda are a friendly industrious race, and
<br/>thousands of the Balobale find an asylum among them from
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> dealing</span> propensities of their chiefs. They seem to possess
<br/>a more vivid conviction of their relation to the unseen world
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>than any of the <span class="">southern tribes</span>. In the deep dark forests near
<br/>their villages we always met with idols and places of prayer. The
<br/>latter are spots about four feet broad and forty long kept carefully
<br/>clear of vegetation and fallen leaves. They resemble garden walks

<br/>branching off from the common foot path and have two or three partitions
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> them of split sticks of grass and generally terminate at a tree. There
<br/>in the still darkness of the forest night the worshipper either male or female
<br/>comes alone and prays to the gods (Batimo) or spirits of departed relatives
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and when an answer to the petition seems granted, meal or other
<br/>food is sprinkled on the spot as a thank offering. The Balonda
<br/>extend to 7º South Lat. and their paramount chief is always named
<br/><span class="">Matiamvo</span>. There are many subordinate chiefs all nearly <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independent">independant</span>
<br/>The Balobale possess the same character but are more warlike yet no
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>prudent <span class="">white man</span> would be in the least danger among them.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">It seems proper to refer to the Chiboque Bashinge and Bangala
<br/>who treated us more scurvily than any I had previously met with
<br/>in <span class="">Africa</span>. And in estimating their actions it will be but fair
<br/>to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> ourselves as placed in their circumstances. They have

<br/>Real Portuguese would not submit to the imposition but the <span class="">men

<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>is easier in a densely wooded country than to abstract chainful after
<br/>chainful of <span class="">slaves</span> - or kidnap straggling carriers in the rear. The
<br/>tribes have by this process imbibed the idea that they have as
<br/>undoubted a right to these <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">fines</span> as our good bishops have to
<br/>theirs. Could it therefore be otherwise than utterly disgusting to
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>get the impudent answer from 2 <span class="">chartists</span> "who had only five guns"
<br/>"We <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> pay for treading the earth of God our common
<br/>father". They were indignant to behold an unblushing attempt
<br/>to defraud the revenue and uttered shouts of most patriotic
<br/>disgust. Could we have done less? Sometimes they levelled their
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>guns at us and it seemed as if we must fight to prevent
<br/>entire plunder and reduction to <span class="">slavery</span>. A quiet arrangement
<br/>by which chief and councillors were quite within range of the spearmen
<br/>and our assertion that we were neither <span class="">slavedealers</span> nor soldiers &amp;
<br/>would fight only after they had struck the first blow. It would
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>have been dangerous to fire without killing for one being defenceless
<br/>till the piece is reloaded, the enemy is encouraged by seeing a
<br/>good chance before this can be effected. These were trying times, the
<br/>more especially as I had no <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">predilection</span> towards ending my <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: career">carreer</span>

<br/>as a "<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">soger</span>" But it cannot be said they acted unreasonably. Indeed
<br/>considering their circumstances, and entire ignorance of our previous
<br/>good conduct, unreasonableness cannot be said to be a more obstinate
<br/>hereditary complaint in <span class="">Africa</span> than in <span class="">Ireland</span>. I thank God we did
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>them no harm and no one need fear vengeance on our account
<br/>A few more visits on the same principle would render them as
<br/>safe as all other tribes, concerning which it may  confidently stated
<br/>that if one behaves as a gentleman, he will invariably be treated as
<br/>such. Contrary conduct will give rise to remarks and treatment of scorn.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">Reference has been made to the Barotse Batoka &amp;c. as of
<br/>the true <span class="">negro</span> race which occupies the <span class="">interior of the continent</span>
<br/>By their subjection to the Makololo they have acquired considerable
<br/>knowledge of the Sichuana language. We have thus a very
<br/>important field open in a tongue into which the whole of the <span class="">sacred
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>scriptures</span> will it is hoped soon be translated, and the time necessary
<br/>for learning and reducing the <span class="">negro</span> language may not be so
<br/>barren as is usually the case. The Barotse, Batoka, Balonda,
<br/>and <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">Balonda</span><span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">Ambonda dialects</span> (or language spoken by the <span class="">Angolese</span>) With those spoken
<br/>in <span class="">Luba</span> &amp; beyond, as also those of people on the <span class="">East coast</span> are
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>all undoubtedly cognate with the Bechuana tongue and <span class="">Caffre</span>.
<br/>The very considerable number of words exactly alike or only
<br/>slightly varied in their inflexions can only be explained on
<br/>that hypothesis for there has been no intercourse between
<br/>these <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">tribes</span> at least for centuries past. Each of the <span class="">negro</span> tribes
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>readily learns the language of the others. The Bechuanas
<br/>however often fail to acquire that of the <span class="">negroes</span> though living
<br/>among them, yet <span class="">my companions</span> acquired it in <span class="">Angola</span> as
<br/>readily as I could a smattering of Portuguese and failed entirely
<br/>in the latter. Fever prevented my learning more <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">of the Balonda</span> than the
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>interpreter of a late <span class=""><span class="">Cape</span> Governor</span> had of Sitchuana when

<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>by a Basuta chief. The influence of the <span class="">sacred scriptures</span> in
<br/>the true <span class="">negro</span> language will be immense, If we call the
<br/>actual amount of conversion the direct results of missions
<br/>and the wide diffusion of better principles the indirect I have
<br/>no hesitation in asserting that the latter are of infinite more
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>importance than the former. I do not undervalue the importance
<br/>of the conversion and salvation of the most abject creature
<br/>that breathes. it is of overwhelming worth to him personally
<br/>But viewing our work of wide sowing of the good seed
<br/>relatively to the harvest which will be reaped when all

      

	<span class="pb-title">0010</span>
<br/>our heads are low there can I think be no comparison
<br/>It seems necessary in pointing out a large new field and
<br/>counselling its immediate occupation that I should advert
<br/>to this subject. for we have been amused once and again of
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>late with the <span class="underline ">discovery</span> that concentration of missionary
<br/>agency is what is needed, and not that sowing beside all
<br/>waters which led you to send <span class="">Morison</span> and <span class="">Milne</span> to <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; "><span class="">China</span></span> be

<br/>Society</span> to look to the <span class="">Antipodes</span> &amp; <span class="">Patagonia</span> <span class="add  above">&amp; <span class="">East Africa</span></span> with the full knowledge
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that charity begins at home. The question involves various
<br/>elements which I have not the means of solving. I therefore speak
<br/>with diffidence though any report within my reach during the
<br/>last ten or twelve years seems to say. "<span class="underline ">the more concentration
<br/>the less success"</span> i.e. If you increase missionaries so that
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>they bear a proportion of more than one to 2000 or 3000 of the
<br/>population - in ten years the proportion of <span class="">communicants</span>
<br/>will be very much less per man employed than if the proportion
<br/>had been one to 20000 of the people. I refer to <span class="">Africa</span> alone
<br/>and as it has been held forth as an example of the good effects
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of concentration it is singular if you glance at the numbers
<br/>of <span class="">communicants</span> &amp; numbers of missionaries - the one is in
<br/>inverse ratio to the other though it is believed that there
<br/>is not much difference in the standards of admission.
<br/>Time is more essential than concentration. Let the seed be sown and
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>there is no more doubt of its vitality and germination than there is of the
<br/>general spring &amp; harvest in the course of nature. Although I have not
<br/>the most distant hope that we shall ever approach to anything like
<br/>converting or "conversions to order" the subject merits attention in-
<br/>asmuch as it may be elicited that there has been a great deal
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>more done both directly and indirectly in <span class="">India</span> <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">more</span> than men believe.
<br/>Will it be out of place to recommend the subject to our

<br/><p class="p ">It might be premature to contemplate the probability of
<br/>any results from the circulation of the <span class="">edition of the testament</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>which was furnished to <span class="">Park</span>. But the circumstances are
<br/>somewhat similar seeing all the <span class="">Arabs</span> I have met with are
<br/>able to read and write. We may accomplish that which
<br/>he was not permitted to do. It will at all events be working
<br/>in the right direction. Schemers though we may be there
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>is this difference between us and the worldly wise, While they
<br/>seem annoyed with our fanaticism we are really glad to
<br/>see their schemes, whether of prison or sanitary reform
<br/><span class=""><span class="">Niger</span> expeditions</span> or soup kitchens, and wish they would
<br/>make another attempt at the commercial aspect of this field.
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>The <span class="">Africans</span> are all deeply <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">imbued</span> with the spirit of trade. We
<br/>found great difficulty in getting past many villages. Every

<br/>suppers from them. And having finished all the game they are
<br/>entirely <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: dependent">dependant</span> on English calico for clothing. It is retailed
<br/>to them by inches. A small piece will purchase a <span class="">slave</span>. If
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>they had the opportunity of a market they could raise on their
<br/>rich soil abundance of cotton and Zingolia beans for oil. I
<br/>cannot say they were lazy though they did seem to take the world
<br/>easy - their hair was elaborately curled - many of their villages
<br/>were models of neatness and so were their gardens &amp; huts. Many
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>were inveterate musicians, and made one remember how
<br/>much of our <span class="">Anglo saxon</span> energy <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">is <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: expended">expendeded</span></span> in dress, &amp; in the howling of
<br/>pianos. The men who went with me to <span class="">Loanda</span> did so
<br/>in order to open up a path for commerce and without any
<br/>hope of payment from me. Though compelled to part with
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>their hard won earnings in that city for food on our
<br/>way home. I never heard a murmur - the report they gave
<br/>of the expedition both <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">in</span> public and private and very kind
<br/>expression towards myself were sufficiently flattering. A
<br/>fresh <span class="">party</span> was dispatched with ivory under the guidance
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of an <span class="">Arab</span> from <span class="">Zanzibar</span> and two days only given
<br/>for preparation. And when they return or even
<br/>sooner <span class="">my companions</span> are to start again. That
<br/>their private opinions are in accordance with their
<br/>public professions I have evidence in the number of volunteers
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>who offer themselves to go to the <span class="">East</span> with me knowing I have
<br/>not wherewith to purchase food even. And they are not an
<br/>enthusiastic race either. There is not the least probability of
<br/>any mere adventurer attaining much influence among
<br/>them. If the movement now begun is not checked by
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>some untoward event the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> will certainly come
<br/>to a natural termination in this quarter. Our <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">outzers</span>
<br/>have rendered <span class="">slaves</span> of so little value now on the coast

<br/>they could not come for <span class="">slaves</span> alone but the Makololo
<br/>feeling the value of the ivory which enables the Mambari to
<br/>make the trip have resolved to purchase it all. Commerce
<br/>has the effect of speedily letting the tribes see their mutual
