<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="">Rev<span class="sup underline ">d</span> W.Thompson</span> <span class="add  inline">Copied</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Enclosed you will <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">two documents</span> which I doubt not will interest you and
<br/>may be of use to you in your forthcoming work "<span class="">History
<br/>of the <span class="">Cape Colony</span> during the last ten years</span>". Put down my
<br/>name as a subscriber for five copies. In the mean
<br/>time however you may publish <span class=""><span class="">Viljoen</span>'s letter</span> in the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Mail</span> or <span class="">Advertizer</span>. It is pretty fair from one who
<br/>has been an extensive dealer in gunpowder among the
<br/><span class="">natives</span> and who I have no doubt had a load of the
<br/>same article, then, in his waggon for sale. This is the
<br/>same individual too who bought several boys at the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Lake in <span class="">1851</span>. I shall copy <span class="">one of <span class="">Sechele</span>'s letters</span> for
<br/>you before I close this and if you thought proper you
<br/>might send it on to the <span class="">Directors</span>. I have sent a 
<br/>copy of <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s letter</span> and also <span class="">one of <span class="">Viljoen</span>'s</span> to the
<br/>British Resident <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Green</span>. And <span class="">a letter</span> explanatory
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of the <span class="">documents</span> as violations of the provisions
<br/>of the <span class="">treaty</span> of the <span class="">Commissioners</span>. It is somewhat
<br/>in the same strain as that sent through you to

	

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>the <span class="">Lieutenant Governor</span> which I hope you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>,
<br/>but I conclude in the following manner "In the hope 
<br/>that the communication of these facts may lead to the
<br/>cessation of the violation <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">of the provisions &amp;c</span> of the <span class="">treaty</span>. <span class="underline ">And compensation
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for losses sustained by such violation</span>" I am &amp;c &amp;c <span class="">DL.</span>
<br/>Now I have not the smallest expectation of any com<br/>pensation but I thought I ought to make the losses
<br/>known to the proper <span class="">authorities</span> so that they may have
<br/>no excuse if they pay no attention to them. And as the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">British Resident</span> has two brothers now on a trading
<br/>expedition to <span class=""><span class="">Sebitoane</span>'s country</span> and they having
<br/>lost considerable property in the plundering of my
<br/>house and burning of <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s town</span> - Their relays
<br/>of cattle too were taken away - All which property is
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>believed to belong to the <span class="">British Resident</span> himself. It is
<br/>not unlikely but that he may claim compensation
<br/>and should he get it I may come in for a share. 
<br/>At any rate it will look better for him to make a
<br/>noise about my property than about his brothers'
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>alias his own. The <span class="">Boers</span> are on the watch for his
<br/>brothers and <span class="">Webb</span> who are in the country beyond
<br/>the Bamangwato. Indeed we heard by some hunters
<br/>who came two days ago that the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> are waiting
<br/>for the English gentlemen somewhere between the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>Bamangwato and the <span class="">Zouga</span> with laudable intention

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>of plundering them. I don't want the English gentlemen
<br/>to be killed but I am inclined to pray that they may
<br/>be stripped to the buffs and come out like those bashful
<br/>blades who were told to tarry at <span class="">Jericho</span>. I am quite glad
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>they have lost a good deal at <span class="">Kolobeng</span>, I am only afraid
<br/>they don't get insulted enough to make them speak out
<br/>when they come to the <span class="">colony</span>. I being one of the "<span class="">Rebel
<br/>maakers</span>" and a fanatic withal. The only comfort that
<br/>will be bestowed on me will be "served him right"
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>But if some of the Devil's children be hustled then we
<br/>shall have <span class="add  above">a</span> decentish boohoo. I added a private
<br/>note to the <span class="">British Resident</span> giving the news so far
<br/>as we have heard then of his brothers, their losses.
<br/>The success of their trading at <span class=""><span class="">Sebitoane</span>'s</span> and the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>probable plunder of all they have got &amp;c making the
<br/>picture quite plain. He wont need spectacles to see
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> hauling out the big tusks out of his brothers'
<br/>waggon, will he? And if he says nothing sharp to the
<br/><span class=""><span class="">Boer</span> Republic</span>, it will be because <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Commissioner
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Owen</span> lays an embargo on everthing likely to disturb
<br/>his <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">country</span>. So - the mighty fuss about punishing
<br/><span class="">Kreli</span> has turned out a windbag. Well done <span class="">Kreli</span>! and
<br/>you ye Fingoes remember <span class="">Botha</span> - vebum sat. sap.
<br/>The world is becoming worse I fear. The <span class="">Pope</span> at
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>home and <span class="">Sandillah</span> and <span class="">General Uithaalder</span> abroad what next?

	

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>Will you come to the dinner to <span class="">Uithaalder</span>? Of course he
<br/>will get a dinner as well as <span class="">Pretorius</span>.The <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Peit</span>
<br/>Scholtz</span> who was feasted at <span class="">Natal</span> with <span class="">Pretorius</span>
<br/>was Commandant at the <span class="">Kolobeng</span>! He did not
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>bury all the dead of his own <span class="">party</span>. And they are all
<br/>now dreadfully exasperated at me. They say I taught
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> to shoot <span class="">Boers</span> and they will have my head
<br/>yet. As I have still a little use for my head I am
<br/><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">still</span> on the look out here watching to see the path
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>clear a head. And what think you is the drama in
<br/>front. A <span class="">party of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span></span> waiting beyond the Bamangwato
<br/>to plunder &amp; perhaps kill a few Englishmen and at the
<br/>same time two <span class="">parties of <span class="">natives</span></span> on the look out to
<br/>kill them. It will be a wonder if a <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boer">boer</span></span> escapes. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>When the path is clear then I shall have run for
<br/>it. <span class="underline ">All is peace beyond</span>. Some <span class="">Griqua</span> hunters
<br/>have approached the outposts of <span class="">Mosilikatse</span> and He
<br/>sends a message to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Moffat</span> "Why <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> you come
<br/>and see me, Be sure and come and bring a chair
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>for me. All you told me (about the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>) <span class="add  above">&amp; fighting &amp; killing</span> is true
<br/>He wants to make peace with the <span class="">Griquas</span> &amp;c. O how
<br/>I wish I were away in my own country. Swampy
<br/>boggy though to be.. The reasons which make
<br/>me doubt whether I ought to draw anything for
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">Mebaloe</span> are the following and as you are fond

	

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><span class="add  above">2<span class="sup ">d</span> sheet</span> you may take it as part of the <span class="">Bakwain
<br/>mission</span>. I mentioned to you that after three years
<br/>consistent conduct and profession of faith in <span class="">Christ</span>
<br/>I baptized <span class="">Sechele</span> on the first Sabbath of <span class="">October 1848</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>In <span class="">March</span> or <span class="">April 1849</span> it was discovered that
<br/>he had had connection with one of his former
<br/>wives whom in consequence of having a young
<br/>child and no parents he had found impossible
<br/>to send away with the others. He at once confessed
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>his sin and added as an excuse that having been
<br/>accustomed to her he had not at the time felt
<br/>as if he were sinning by going to another man's
<br/>wife. He professed much penitence entreating me
<br/>not to cast him off "as he hoped to stand along
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>with me before the throne of <span class="">Jesus</span>". I cut him
<br/>off from fellowship and as he entreated to be
<br/>allowed to remain as a <span class="underline ">spectator</span> only at the
<br/>ordinance and I felt that I must not count him
<br/>as an enemy, I acceded to his request. He 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>sat back from the spot where the few <span class="">believers</span> 
<br/>communicated on two or three occasions which
<br/>occurred subsequently to his fall and his manner
<br/>being no ways changed from what it had been

	

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>previously I indulged the hope that if he continued
<br/>to walk uprightly for two or three years we might
<br/>again <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span> him. Immediately after his fall
<br/>I wrote to the <span class="">Directors</span> about it knowing that
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>they would sympathize with me in my sorrow, and
<br/>I mentioned to them subsequently the fact of his
<br/>walking consistently. I thought this was sufficient
<br/>unless I had restored him again. But as soon as I
<br/>heard of his conduct in the case of <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Moyle</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>as it seemed widely different from consistency, I
<br/>wrote to the <span class="">Directors</span> a detailed account of the circumstances 
<br/>and stated that I now considered him an entire
<br/>backslider though not an apostate. I was the
<br/>more careful to give the facts of his case because
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>they had in some speeches made reference to his
<br/>conversion, and some who did not of course know
<br/>what I had written thought that I must still be
<br/>holding up <span class="">Sechele</span> to the <span class="">Board</span> as a convert
<br/>Well eight or ten months after <span class="">Sechele</span> was
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>cut off a worse affair came to light amongst
<br/>the young people belonging to the families of the
<br/>two <span class=""><span class="">native</span> teachers</span> <span class="">Mebaloe</span> and <span class="">Paul</span> viz. excessive
<br/>impunity and when I began to make enquiry I
<br/>found out that the teachers must have known 

	

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>of it and kept me in ignorance. This is a peculiarity
<br/>among <span class="">Bechuana believers</span>. They never will make known
<br/>the sins of their fellow <span class="">believers</span> and when anything
<br/>comes to light, then they quietly remark "O we knew
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>all about it long ago" The wives of the teachers too
<br/>had been using enchantments. I felt very much vexed
<br/>to think I had been administering the ordinance to them
<br/>as consistent <span class="">believers</span>, and the whole town knowing
<br/>all the while what their conduct had been. Their number
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>being only seven I cut the whole off having <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">had</span> no ordinance
<br/>at all since. None of them even asked why they were
<br/>kept so, they seemed determined to act as if they
<br/>had never been guilty or as if they believed that I
<br/>knew nothing about it. <span class="">Paul</span>'s family being notoriously
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>bad I requested him to leave but he did not go
<br/><span class="">Mebaloe</span> however confessed to me before I went to
<br/>the <span class="">Cape</span> that they had done great harm to the cause
<br/>in fact, said he, we have spoiled the teaching at
<br/><span class="">Kolobeng</span>. The <span class="">Boers</span> now have cleared out the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>whole of them. I did not pay them anything
<br/>from the time I discovered their inconsistency but
<br/><span class="">Mebaloe</span> having confessed his sin and also carried
<br/>on the school up to the time of the <span class="">Boer</span>s' attack I may
<br/>perhaps without impropriety draw a years salary 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>for him. I have not yet however made up my mind

	

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>There are always two sides to a story. Well the other side
<br/>is this. <span class="">Ashton</span> loquitur - "<span class="">Livingston</span> cut off the whole
<br/>of the <span class="">believers</span> at <span class="">Kolobeng</span> because he had not moral
<br/>courage to cut off <span class="">Sechele</span>." And he <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receives">recieves</span> the delinquints
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>into <span class=""><span class="">Kuruman</span> church</span> without asking a note of demission
<br/>according to the universal custom of the churches here
<br/>Then again he proposed to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Moffat</span> to write a
<br/><span class="">joint letter to the <span class="">Directors</span></span> denouncing my falsehood
<br/>in holding up <span class="">Sechele</span> to the <span class="">Directors</span> as a convert
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>all the while knowing that he is an apostate". <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>M.</span> of course declined this. Now I am in a fix
<br/>if I haul him up for his remarks it will be
<br/>another quarrel such as took place nine years ago
<br/>when <span class="">Edwards</span> and <span class="">Inglis</span> took it into their heads to
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>say I quarrelled with them and which <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">quarrel</span> the <span class="">Directors</span>
<br/>tell me now, still exists. If I let him alone and say
<br/>nothing then he will be sure that his remark about
<br/>my want of moral courage is correct. Shall I
<br/>brave the row, or the imputation. I feel inclined
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to do the latter as requiring more courage than the
<br/>former. This will be "Jouk &amp; let the jaw gang by"
<br/>But I am giving you letters equal in length to the
<br/><span class="">Times Newspaper</span> and you give me ½ sheets. Take care
<br/>my friend. Old <span class="">John Wylde</span> is nothing to me if I open out
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>on you. Tell me some of your trials (omitting the
<br/><span class="">Brit. Quar</span> one) And how you manage to overcome

	

	<span class="pb-title">0009</span>
<br/><span class="add  above">3<span class="sup ">d</span> sheet</span> It is something to overcome oneself. I would not men

<br/>be treating you with any confidence and I cannot help
<br/>believing that you possess a great deal more prudence
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>than I ever did or ever will get hold of. In proof
<br/>of want of prudence I intend to begin tomorrow another
<br/>spell for the <span class="">British Quarterly</span> on the <span class="">Caffre</span> war. It is

<br/>it is infamous to see our <span class=""><span class="">Cape</span> <span class="">Government</span></span> scraping

<br/>but done nothing else except collecting words and
<br/>making notes (a very few on natural history) when
<br/>I think of it, it grows on me and seems a work
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of a life time. And I suspect mine will not be
<br/>a long one. I cannot get over the idea that
<br/>complaining of one's ailments is old wifish yet
<br/>a pain in my chest I never felt before when
<br/>I exert myself to speak as loudly as I used to
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>do in preaching warns me that my days are few
<br/>In preaching in Sichuana which I do occasionally
<br/>I feel at home and speak much more loudly and
<br/>quickly than when gasping for words as much
<br/>as for breath &amp; voice in <span class="">Union Chapel</span>. Will you
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>present my kind remembrances to <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Abercrombie</span></p>
