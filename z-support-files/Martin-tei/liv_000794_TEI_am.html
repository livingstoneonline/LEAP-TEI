<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Man</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Your letters are "necessarily brief" So you say. and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I am bound to believe the <span class="">Right Reverend Father William Capeton</span>

<br/>whereof lieth in an immense sheet of paper which must be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>filled for Nature abhorreth a vacuum, and want of time to shorten them</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The <span class="">Directors</span> and you are wonderful men. The former

<br/>informed that no meeting will take place till such writing 
<br/>has been <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>. And they at same time cooly tell me that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>they hope I shall derive counsel assistance &amp;c &amp;c. from the <span class="">com-
<br/>-mittee</span> of which no meeting can take place. Then you if I recollect 
<br/>aright twitted me about our <span class="">Committee</span> being defunct and 
<br/>yet presume the matter of a companion will come before it. 
<br/>But who will go? I am gone. No matter my compassion 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>can follow. The <span class="">Directors</span> requested <span class="">Ashton</span> to leave the 
<br/><span class="">Kuruman</span> and settle with a tribe as I had done. He refused. 
<br/>Subsequently <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Freeman</span> proposed in <span class="">Committee</span> held at 
<br/><span class="">Kuruman</span> that <span class="">Ashton</span> should go to <span class="">Borigelong</span>. 
<br/>He refused by saying "It would be like taking <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Ashton</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to her grave" "Then you must take the entire charge 
<br/>of the printing press (<span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> had till then done the

<br/>certainly. But here I am after my <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">eight</span> 8<span class="sup underline ">th</span> attack of

<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>does not matter much. I never laid by. but vertigo from

<br/>severely for entrusting them to a young man through his

<br/>men to the region of the Lake or to the parts beyond? For <span class="">Lobale</span>"? 
<br/>"<span class="underline ">In future</span>" The dear man! how many has he sent in time

<br/><p class="p ">I was delayed long at <span class="">Kuruman</span> by the <span class="">Boers</span> and want 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of people for all feared to go North. but having got over these 
<br/>difficulties we made very good progress till we came into Lat.
<br/>19° 16' South. There all <span class="">my people</span> were knocked down by fever
<br/>except one Bakwain lad. I managed the hospital and he the oxen 
<br/>and by Gods mercy none were cut off. When we were able to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>move Northwards. the poor Bakwain lad took it too. I had to 
<br/>drive and cut a path too for keeping more to the Eastward in order 
<br/>to avoid the Tsetse we traveled through a densely wooded country 
<br/>in which the axe was in constant operation. But for 
<br/>two <span class="">bushmen</span> who managed the loose oxen and otherwise assisted 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>we could not have moved. Some were still so weak we had to 
<br/>lift them out and into the waggon. When we came near the <span class="">Chobe</span>
<br/>the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: adjacent">ajacent</span> country was flooded for 15 miles out. <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Valleys">Vallies</span> appeared 
<br/>like large deep rivers with hippopotami in them. We tried 
<br/>long <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">in vain</span> to get a ford through one large river called <span class="">Sanshureh</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>our <span class="">bushmen</span> decamped too. So I took a small pontoon kindly 
<br/>presented by Mssrs <span class="">Welch</span> and <span class="">Codrington</span> and the strongest of my 
<br/>weak crew. crossed the <span class="">Sanshureh</span>. ½ a mile wide and went 
<br/>North to find the <span class="">Chobe</span> &amp; people. We waded among reed and high 
<br/>grass for three days trying to obtain a passage in to the <span class="">Chobe</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>through the dense masses of reed &amp;c which line its banks

    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>On the fourth day we obtained our object, launched the pontoon and 
<br/>after passing along about 20 miles we reached a <span class="">Makololo village</span> 
<br/>In their figurative language they said I "had come upon them as if 
<br/>I had dropped out of a cloud yet I came riding on the back of a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>hippopotamus" A rumour had reached the Makololo previously 
<br/>and two <span class="">parties</span> had been sent out in search of us. All our difficulties 
<br/>were now at an end. Canoes were soon sent down by the chief 
<br/>our waggons &amp;c. were transported <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> the country &amp; river &amp; 
<br/>after proceeding North in order to avoid the flooded lands on the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>other side, we turned S.W. &amp; reached the town. Our reception was 
<br/>far more flattering than I could have anticipated. The chief just over 
<br/>18 years of age said he rejoiced to obtain another father instead of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Sebitoane</span></span>
<br/>and repeated requested me to name whatever I wished and he would shew 
<br/>his affection by giving it. cattle, ivory, &amp;c &amp;c and he seemed distressed 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>when I refused to name anything - He is not equal in appearance 
<br/>or abilities to his father but there is nothing weak or childish in his 
<br/>conduct or conversation, and several executions which have taken 
<br/>place on account of conspiracy, shew that he is not destitute of 
<br/><span class="">Sebitoane</span>'s energy. He is afraid to learn to read at present "lest it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>should change his heart and make him content with one wife" 
<br/>as in the case of <span class="">Sechele</span>. I like a frank objection - one cannot 
<br/>get a hold on a "Ya Mynheer" They are too oily. I have just 
<br/>returned from a nine weeks tour through the country in search of 
<br/>a suitable location for a mission. Went up the <span class="">Barotse River</span> or 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>as it is universally called by the Makalaka - the <span class=""><span class="">aboriginal</span> inhabitants</span> 
<br/>- the <span class="">black race</span> of whom I spoke - the <span class="">Leeamb</span> or "the River." 
<br/>reached the confluence of the <span class="">Loeti</span> with its light coloured water
<br/>also that of the <span class="">Leeba</span> or <span class="">Lonta</span>. <span class="">Londa</span> is the proper nam
<br/>because it comes from <span class="">Londa</span> the capital of a large state. The 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>confluence of the <span class="">Londa</span> and <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Leeambye">Leeamby</span></span> is in 14° 11' South
<br/>this is a point of great importance for the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Leeambye">Leeamby</span></span>. twins 
<br/>thence away to the East N. East. The <span class="">Londa</span> about 150 yards 
<br/>wide. (the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Leeambye">Leeamby</span></span> about 250  beyond it) The <span class="">Londa</span> coming from 
<br/>the N. &amp; by W. or N.N.W. is. I dream yet to form part 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of our way West. Conveyance by water is of great importance 
<br/>with 6 paddlers we went 44 miles of Latitude in one day of 10½
<br/>hours and taking into account the windings of the river and 
<br/>our course being what sailors term a 2½ point one the actual 
<br/>distance must have been upwards of 50 Geographical miles 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>The river is one of very great beauty &amp; breadth. It is often more 
<br/>than a mile broad with islands 3 or four miles long in it. 
<br/>These are covered with sylvan vegetation. The rounded masses 
<br/>of which seem to recline on the bosom of the water. The 
<br/>Tsetse spoils the most beautiful and healthful spots. I must 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>reserve details. but after a laborious search have not 
<br/>found a spot I could pronounce salubrious. We must 
<br/>brave the fever. It is God not the Devil that rules our 
<br/>destiny. Surely we may when <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> traders</span> do. I met

<br/>write readily. And Portuguese from the Farthest trading station 
<br/>inland on the <span class="">West</span>. The latter probably through the influence of 
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="">Chevalier Du Pratt</span>'s letter</span> and passport shewed me every civility 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>An intrigue with an underchief who had pretentions to the 
<br/>chieftainship enabled the latter to drive a brisk <span class="">trade in <span class="">slaves</span></span> 
<br/>in the <span class="">Northern half of the <span class="">Makololo country</span></span>. Nothing was done 
<br/>here. to encourage them to call again. A stockade was erected 
<br/>in the <span class="">Barotse country</span>, a flagstaff for the Portuguese banner 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">erected</span><span class="add  above">set up</span>. A small cannon given to the pretender who it is supposed 
<br/>gave authority for the prosecution of the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> trade</span> contrary 
<br/>to the orders of the chief. The conduct on the part of the merchant 
<br/>was very silly for no sooner was the intrigue known, than the 
<br/>chief conspirators were cut off and their bodies tumbled into the River 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>On my remonstrating against bloodshed the answer given was "We are 
<br/>still <span class="">Boers</span>. We are not yet taught." They would have expelled the 
<br/><span class=""><span class="">slave</span> merchant</span> too. but refrained on my representing that their 
<br/>doing so might injure me in the <span class="">West</span> and their departure is 
<br/>to take place soon. I go Westward as soon as the rains commence 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I have preached in many spot where the name of <span class="">Christ</span> was never
