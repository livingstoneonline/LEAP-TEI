<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 5 words ">                                        </span>We have had an unexpected
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>opportunity of sending <span class="">letters</span> back to <span class="">Angola</span> but
<br/>the time afforded has been so short I have sent
<br/>a few notes only. This will follow the <span class="">Arab</span>
<br/>who left this morning and I hope will reach
<br/>you some time or other and let you <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">know</span> I am
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>not unmindful of my friends though
<br/>separated from them by a precious big
<br/>lump of this which the philosophers call
<br/>"our <span class="underline ">little</span> planet"! I have scarcely had time
<br/>to peruse my <span class="">letters</span> which we found had lain
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>on an island in the <span class="">Leeambye</span>, close to <span class="">falls
<br/>of Mosioatunya</span> a whole year. Such a rush
<br/>of thoughts and trembling emotions when
<br/>I opened <span class="">letters from my family</span> you may
<br/>imagine if you can, taking it into consideration
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>that I have been without information for
<br/>nearly three years. Thank God I had no
<br/>reason to sorrow. I requested my friends
<br/>to write to <span class="">Loanda</span>, but though detained
<br/>there for many mo<span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">n</span>ths by sickness I never 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>got a line. And I suppose their respectful
<br/>silence may be translated into a rebuke for
<br/>imagining that I should ever reach that
<br/>port. "You think more highly of yourself than
<br/>you ought to think" Well I must try and

        

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">and</span> be thankful even for that.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I commence the descent of the river for
<br/><span class="">Quilimane</span> at the beginning of <span class="">October</span>. The
<br/>path we have already opened up has many
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>advantages. The Portuguese post comes 3
<br/>times a month to <span class="">Cassange</span> 300 miles
<br/>inland and goods are considerably cheaper
<br/>than in the <span class="">Cape Colony</span>. I mean, such as
<br/>misssionaries require coffee, tea, sugar, cloths &amp;c
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Labour is extremely cheap in <span class="">Angola</span> &amp;
<br/>anything manufactured by the <span class="">natives</span> is got
<br/>for a trifle. I bought a pair of Wellingtons
<br/>boots at <span class="">Pungo Andongo</span> more than
<br/>200 miles from the sea for five shillings
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and eight pence English money and
<br/>that was exactly the price given to <span class="">natives</span>
<br/>by a <span class="">merchant</span> of the place for <span class="underline ">one</span>
<br/><span class="underline ">pound</span> of ivory. This is more than the
<br/>slimmest <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boer">boer</span></span> would get in <span class="">Cape town</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>The difference in prices was explained by
<br/>the Americans giving larger prices than the
<br/>English. They have all the <span class="">Loanda</span> trade
<br/>in their hands. The advantage to the
<br/><span class="">natives</span> is, out of sight, greater than in
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the Colony Take <span class="">Cassange</span> and any 
<br/>spot 300 miles inland from the <span class="">Southern
<br/>coasts of <span class="">S. Africa</span></span> a <span class="">native</span> will get from
<br/>five to seven times more in the <span class="">North</span>
<br/>than in the <span class="">South</span> for his ivory. The

    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>trade of the Portuguese might have been pushed
<br/>much farther but as I saw the other day
<br/>in a history of <span class="">Angola</span>. A law was made
<br/>prohibiting <span class="">white traders</span> from going into
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the <span class="">Interior</span> because in almost every case
<br/>in which war was necessary to punish
<br/>the <span class="">natives</span> for the murder of <span class="">white men</span>
<br/>investigation shewed that the <span class="">white</span> and
<br/>not the <span class="">black man</span> was the aggressor.
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Black men</span> "mão calçada" might be sent
<br/>with goods but no <span class="">white man</span> go
<br/>himself under a severe penalty. And this
<br/>law continued in force during successive
<br/><span class="">governments</span>. I think it is still in
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>force for when I was coming through 
<br/><span class="">Cassange</span> lately the Commandant sent
<br/>an order to all the traders <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">(about 40)</span> along the 
<br/><span class="">River Quango</span> &amp; other places in the
<br/>vicinity to return to the village. and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>on their refusal the matter was remitted
<br/>to the <span class="">Governor of <span class="">Loanda</span></span>. there is no
<br/>restriction on trade except what is implied
<br/>in the above. It goes on briskly from
<br/>both coasts. <span class="">Arabs</span> and <span class="">Portuguese</span> are met
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>with everywhere. The latter are like our <span class="">Griquas</span>
<br/>namely, half blood. and it is curious they
<br/>have been found in the course of a few 
<br/>generations to become black again. The
<br/><span class="">Portuguese</span> marry <span class="">black women</span> there

    

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>being very few <span class="">white ladies</span> in the country.
<br/>And unlike our immaculate <span class="">Transvaal</span>
<br/>congregation never disown their children.
<br/>I made enquiry and found one person only
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>whose children might answer like "Topsy"
<br/>"Never had any father nor nothing" Persons
<br/>of colour of respectability sit at the tables 
<br/>of the richest without as far as I could
<br/>observe any distinction on account of
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>race. And I met a canon of the church
<br/>who was as black as <span class="">caffre</span> with short
<br/>wooly hair, thick lips &amp; he is greatly 
<br/>repsected and the gentleman with whom
<br/>I was living had known him as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>having acted with uniform propriety
<br/>in his high office for 28 years. He
<br/>had just returned from a accompanying
<br/>the <span class="">prince of <span class="">Congo</span></span> to <span class="">Portugal</span> and
<br/>the King had decorated him with one
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of the orders of merit as a token of
<br/>approbation. I found the Portuguese
<br/>exceedingly hospitable not to me alone
<br/>but to all traders whom we met either
<br/>going <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">and</span><span class="add  above">or</span> returning. They are certainly

    

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>equal in this respect to the Dutch of
<br/>former times and to their descendants
<br/>of the present day as I found them in 
<br/>the <span class="">Western districts</span>, not yet soured by
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the frequent visits of blackguard scoffing
<br/>Englishmen. The <span class="">black races</span> in the vicintiy
<br/>of the Portuguese settlements are immeasurably
<br/>worse than the <span class=""><span class="">Southern</span> tribes</span> <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">of</span><span class="add  above">among</span> which I 
<br/>have had experience. From the <span class="">Casai</span> to
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the <span class="">orange River</span> I should say to every traveller
<br/>or trader Behave like a gentleman and
<br/>you will be treated as such. Play the monkey
<br/>be impudent and try to cheat and you
<br/>will get "monkey's allowance"- the greater
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>wickedness of the <span class="">tribes <span class="">North of the <span class="">Casai</span></span></span>
<br/>admits of easy explanation, but you must
<br/>be content with my assertions only, for the
<br/>present. When I can find time I shall let
<br/>you into it. Rest assured it has not been
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>caused by the ruffian <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Zendelings</span></span> of the
<br/><span class="">independants society</span>. I was the first
<br/>missionary they ever saw, and we were
<br/>attacked four times by them. Plunder
<br/>was their object, once <span class="underline ">we beat them</span> off
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>by simply sitting and looking at them
<br/>after telling them they must strike the first
<br/>blow. They were well supplied with guns
<br/>and sometimes presented them at us. Another
<br/>tribe began by plundering the goods carried</p>
	<p class="ab ">
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>a disjointed sentence in your note about being satisfied with our
<br/>position in the church seems to point to something not right in my last 
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> remember it. I certainly never intended aught but civility
    </p>


	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/><p class="p ">by those of <span class="">our party</span> in the rear, firing and
<br/>shouting ensued when we went back to them
<br/>and the chief being busy leading inexpertly
<br/>found a revolver within a foot of his
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>stomach, and hostilities were quickly brought
<br/>to a close without any one being hurt on
<br/>either side. On several other occasions we
<br/>were considerably bothered and it apeared
<br/>as if we must fire, but in addition to a
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>strong aversion to shedding human blood
<br/>I had the school boy feeling of "strike your
<br/>match" wonderfully strong. I wished if
<br/>I must turn "soger" I had a parcel
<br/>of Russians <span class="underline ">or</span> <span class="">Velschoons</span> in opposition  
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and not these poor ignorant savages.
<br/>At present I firmly believe that we might
<br/>go back without a tithe of the molestation we
<br/>experienced, and two or three harmless
<br/>visits would render the path as safe as
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a colonial one.. It is not likely I shall
<br/>ever go <span class="">South</span> again except by Sea. My
<br/>waggon stands as safe here as it would
<br/>do in <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hoffmeyer</span>'s garden. Nothing was
<br/>touched during our two year absence
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>It is simply useless except as a house
<br/>Canoes are the means of conveyance
<br/>The <span class="">Leeambye</span> &amp; <span class="">Chobe</span> rose unusually
<br/>high this year and people went in
<br/>canoes in nearly a straight line from

<br/><span class="">Linyanti</span> to <span class="">Sesheke</span>, about 130 miles.<span class="add gray inline">[</span> I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>
<br/>know where we shall settle except that it
<br/>must be to the North of this. The country is
<br/>finer there. We never carried water but
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>passed two or three good streams each
<br/>day all the way to <span class="">Loanda</span>. The <span class="">natives</span>
<br/>are all armed with guns and swords and
<br/>they have finished the game. The only fault
<br/>of the new path is it admits of conveyance
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>by human labour alone. The forests
<br/>and boggy rivers present insurmountable
<br/>obstacles to waggons. There is another path
<br/>to the <span class="">East coast</span> which crosses at a certain
<br/>point a <span class="">Lake (<span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Tanganyika">Tanganyeñka</span>)</span> 3 days broad
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>From the information I possess it would
<br/>be easier to go that than the way down
<br/>the <span class="">Zambesi</span> but like the path we have
<br/>already opened it does not admit of
<br/>waggons. Clearly then, the path of duty
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>is that I leave the discovery of another

<br/>get water carriage to the coast by going
