<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> <span class="">your several communications</span> by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>Cumming</span> on Saturday last, a bitter cold day having ice standing on all the pools 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in the morning and as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Greig</span> was preparing to leave on the same day as 
<br/>he, (Tuesday) we had not a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: moment's">moments</span> time to answer yours untill Monday
<br/>night. I sat up nearly the whole night in order to give you some particulars
<br/>anent <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span>' charges, &amp;c. But another opportunity being about to
<br/>present itself in the person of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Milligan</span> I sit down to talk a little more
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>leisurely than I could do on the former occasion. We are heartily glad
<br/>at the departure of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Greig</span> but as he is only three days gone we cannot
<br/>yet rejoice with very great confidence as the fellow may come stalking
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> our path again. We liked <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Cumming</span> very much. He is now
<br/>fairly on his way to the Bamangwato. He seems just the right sort of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>person for exploring so far as courage goes &amp; I hope he will come safely back
<br/>Matters go on in much their usual way here, the meetings are not full
<br/>a certain number seem always to come &amp; others only when greater efforts
<br/>for their attendance are made, they sit with much more sedateness
<br/>than formerly, but as yet I see not the least evidence of any change in
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>their habits. Last Sunday, afternoon we had the smallest meeting we have
<br/>had since our return in <span class="">March last</span>. The reason was the feast of harvest
<br/>fell on that day or rather the preparations for it were made for its cele-
<br/>-bration next morning. A Divine power is certainly requisite for their
<br/>conversion. I fear that influence will not be granted so long as the
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>present state of feeling exists between <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> &amp; myself. This consideration
<br/>makes me more than willing to leave the station to himself, for from what
<br/>I know of his quarrel with <span class="">Hume</span>. ours will not soon terminate. If this
<br/>were my only motive I should be deeply grieved for then I could not expect
<br/>the Divine blessing anywhere But I know that I had a desire to be the
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>means of carrying the <span class="">gospel</span> to another tribe before I knew anything of the
<br/>state of feeling which had existed. And when I asked myself the question
<br/>whether I were not in anyway influenced by a desire to get quit of a peculiar<br/>tempered colleague it seemed to me then that his peculiarities only rendered
<br/>it less desirable to remain than it otherwise might have been. There are
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>other feelings in my mind now but I hope &amp; pray that if parted I may
<br/>be able to forgive as I hope to be forgiven. I however shall feel no
<br/>respect for <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> aged though he is, and feeling none, none will be
<br/>expressed. It is probable I shall adopt the same course I adopted (not soon
<br/>enough) with respect to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ross</span>. I shall not speak about him: When
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>we came to <span class="">Kuruman</span> I began it &amp; continued it for three months but
<br/>foolishly departed from it when informed that an opposite course had been
<br/>adopted towards me. I have forgiven him &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> R.</span> from my heart and
<br/>I fear to hear any of their statements now lest all the bitter feelings
<br/>I once had should return against the injurious speeches uttered again
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>&amp; again by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> </span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Ross</span>. I have often spoken in bitter anger but now
<br/>feel sorry I had not more philosophy or rather Christian meekness
<br/>&amp; forbearance. For an investigation of the charges brought against
<br/>me by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> </span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Edwards</span> I feel very desirous for an impartial



	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>investigation in the presence of the bretheren. If I could come I certainly would
<br/>now write to you officially by this opportunity to demand a <span class="">committee</span> meeting
<br/>But the probable circumstances in which my dear partner will then be
<br/>placed convince me that I need no revelation from heaven in order
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to pronounce that it is clearly not my duty to go out. I should be loath 
<br/>besides to leave the station without any one on it but <span class="">Mebaloe</span>
<br/>My leaving the station is I am convinced that which <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> desires, but that
<br/>very desire and the version he will afterwards give of my leaving present
<br/>the greatest obstacles to the following out of my own desire, <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">reg</span> to go
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to another tribe. I will not leave, unless <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">in</span> the decision of the <span class="">committee</span>
<br/>there is something to shew that my leaving involves no acknowledgement
<br/>of guilt. In my heart &amp; before Him who knows my heart I am
<br/>not conscious of having up to the time of our interview given him any
<br/>just cause of offence Now I will not whatever others may think
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>do that which would imply that such consciousness did exist. Ought the
<br/>meeting of <span class="">committee</span> not to be here? Certain statements could
<br/>be better investigated here than anywhere else. For instance <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s
<br/>garden. It is not a hundred paces yet. And then the assertion that I went
<br/>to <span class="">natives</span>. Who are these? One <span class="">native</span> deacon was the only individual
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to whom I mentioned it previous to speaking to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> E.</span> &amp; to <span class="underline ">his</span> <span class="add  above"><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Mapoleane</span></span> wife
<br/>afterwards and to no other. If <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> asserts I did anything else than what
<br/>I have related to you, it is either by mistake of malice utterly untrue
<br/>It is entirely untrue that I accused him of feelings of revenge in
<br/>excluding the woman His own way of relating this story shews
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>that it is so. When asked about the exclusion he denied it. I believed
<br/>him but urged that something should be done in it as the woman had 
<br/>a wrong impression of what had been done, she evidently understood
<br/>exclusion. Now as the object of discipline was the good of the offender
<br/>as well as the purity of the <span class="">church</span>. Let us remove this wrong impression
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>Let her be subject to discipline so that she may not go on in sin
<br/>He replied that he would do right &amp; not care what impression was
<br/>produced, I replied that we ought to be careful not to produce a
<br/>wrong impression lest our good be evil spoken of ᅳ that in
<br/>discipline especially we ought to be careful not to produce the
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>impression that we acted out of private revenge and that we ought
<br/>even to have a good report from those who were without
<br/>He replied but she is within and then as he had repeatedly
<br/>done before, that he did not feel at liberty because the affair had
<br/>happened in his own house &amp;c. It is utterly untrue that I
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>ascribed feelings of revenge to him. He denied that he had excluded
<br/>at all. I believed him &amp; every act of mine afterwards shewed
<br/>that I did so, this case as <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">in</span> the case of the garden was handed
<br/>over to me, and I solemnly declare I thought that in both cases
<br/>I had done the very things he wished me to do. I thought I had obliged 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>him in the case of <span class="">Mapoleane</span> up to the time of our interview
<br/>by taking a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: disagreeable">disagreable</span> subject off his hands. And my thoughts 
<br/>were the very same about the garden up to the receipt of <span class="">your



	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>letter</span> on Saturday last, I nevertheless could in justice have ascribed feelings
<br/>of revenge to him about the meat, or what feelings the expressed resolution
<br/>that <span class="">Mapoleane</span> should get no more of his meat indicate But I never
<br/>did to my recollection ascribe anything improper to him on any occasion
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>previous to our interview, nor did I ever say or do anything which
<br/>I thought could offend him. In the case of the garden he came to me
<br/>and said something like what he gave in version N<span class="sup ">o</span> 2. and that some<br/>-thing to me implied that he had not given satisfaction to all <span class="">parties</span>
<br/>and he wished me to interfere and give a larger piece of ground, so
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>as to effect a good understanding. To do this I remember distinct<br/>-ly I was decidedly averse, &amp; said that I thought the amount he then
<br/>stated was quite enough, I was then walking about But a consider<br/>-able time elapsed before I did anything. A considerable time I say for
<br/>an interval elapsed sufficient to convince <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> that a great
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>number of <span class="">Kurumanites</span> would not come to live with him as 
<br/>he expected. I think it was the return of <span class="">Merupe</span> with the waggon
<br/>that made him first doubt the affections of the <span class="">Kurumanites</span> 
<br/>We had conversations on the subject and we both agreed that
<br/>those who had come first ought to have the largest share &amp; that
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>ground ought not to be kept for those whom he expected. At
<br/>least two months had elapsed after what he related to you. And he 
<br/>had spoiled the lower part of the water ditch before I did anything
<br/>in it. I had previously thought of having my garden below his
<br/>but when I saw that the ditch was useless in a portion or
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>nearly all of his and quite impracticable all below it I prop<br/>-osed that he should shift up a little. I did not tell him
<br/>the principal reason, but shewed him that the ground was
<br/>better as you ascend. He said he had fixed and I might do
<br/>or go where I liked. <span class="">Mebaloe</span> &amp; <span class="">Kobopure</span> were next to him
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>above so I proposed to <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">him</span> <span class="add  above">them</span> to remove to oblige me. Both
<br/>readily consented, so when I took <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s garden I must
<br/>of necessity measure off a garden for both him &amp; <span class="">Kobopure</span>
<br/>Mine was &amp; is equal to all <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s &amp; part of <span class="">Kobopure</span>'s
<br/>I remember distinctly saying. It seems none of our <span class=""><span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>friends</span> are coming untill they see whether we die or not. We
<br/>need not keep land for them till then. I measured off 80
<br/>paces, and asked if he were satisfied. <span class="">Kobopure</span> complained
<br/>of more trees in the new than his former. I said then take
<br/>farther than the 80 paces if you can pick it But you will
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>never pick it all. He then went forward about 20 paces
<br/>more and I asked if he were satisfied, &amp; he replied in the affirmative
<br/>Now it occurs to me if <span class="">Mr E</span> is such a bold <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: outspoken">out spoken</span>
<br/>man why did he never say one word to me implying dissatisfaction 
    
    

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>there are several questions I should like to put to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> one of them is.
<br/>On what occasions did he interfere between the <span class="">natives</span> &amp; me. If he says 
<br/>he ever did except in the one case of appeal which I related and
<br/>to which I put a stop at once he tells what is decidedly untrue ᅳ When
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I was ill, he is quite right in saying that the men were sent to him
<br/>What had they to do with me then? They were more of men than trouble 
<br/>me with <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: anything">any thing</span> but sweet reed, beer, and their own kind 
<br/>sympathizing company more than I liked too sometimes - there
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: was">were</span> only one batch of seven men employed while I was able 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to work. These were asked for by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> and I now recollect
<br/>he asked for them in my heinous way "<span class="underline ">I</span> want<span class="underline ">"</span>. By the by
<br/>there was a fine row with these same men's wages in which
<br/>had I been so disposed I could have interfered to advantage
<br/>But I defended him when they asserted he cheated them Now 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>these same men finished the ditch &amp; the house. I had no
<br/>more to do with these works after I was bitten. When I went
<br/>out the first time to see <span class="">Mary</span>, the walls of the school were built
<br/>in my absence. So we never worked conjointly except for
<br/>a very short time &amp; with that same one batch of seven
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>men whom he asked <span class="add  above">for</span> with the "ego" Now what he means by
<br/>saying the men we asked were always sent to him, <span class="underline ">Always</span>
<br/>what does the <span class="underline ">always</span> mean? We never did on one
<br/>occasion ask for men conjointly. If the men whom I
<br/>employed on my own works were sent to him first he may
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>thank me for calling him "co mogolu" for that but I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>
<br/>believe they ever were. But now I am blamed for calling him
<br/>an old man. About the letters I think too he mistakes, they
<br/>may have gone occasionally first to him But this I know
<br/>I have sometimes sent them when I saw his name &amp; not mine
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>which I believe happened at least once. After my return
<br/>from my first visit to <span class="">Kuruman</span> I am certain they always
<br/>came to me first But it would have been all quite right
<br/>had the paltry circumstance not puffed up the poor old
<br/>man's self importance. <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Don't">Dont</span> mistake the tone of
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>my voice when I say if grey hairs may catch at 
<br/>every straw to bolster up its own importance surely
<br/><span class="underline ">I-I-I-I</span> may do the same. Indeed if <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> really believed
<br/>he was of ₑ⁄₂₀ part of the importance he wishes you to understand 
<br/>he is he would not be in such a dreadful fright lest it should
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>be annihilated. I know however that if it is destroyed it
<br/>will not be by anything that I have said or will say to his
<br/>disadvantage</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><p class="p ">2 sheet</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I cannot accuse myself of having behaved in the way he mentioned to
<br/>you. Previous to our interview he had no just cause of offence and
<br/>yet his first sentence which I took down in his presence was
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>"your conduct has been dishonest dishonourable &amp; mischievous"
<br/>there never has occurred an instance of conduct so base between
<br/>one missionary &amp; another. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> believe there is another instance
<br/>on record" &amp;c. Now I should like to hear these words poured out 
<br/>with the lamb like meekness tears &amp; groans he assumed before
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>you. To all this and a great deal more in the same strain
<br/>I returned only a fair explanation of the whole of my conduct
<br/>with my motives for acting as I did. He then went on talking
<br/>of his honesty &amp;c. and accused me of the opposite ᅳ To this I only
<br/>replied O <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> talk so much of your honesty. It puts one so
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>much in mind of <span class="">Inglis</span>. "I must have an apology said he for
<br/>certain words you made use of", "It is true you made a sort of
<br/>apology but I have no right to be satisfied with that"
<br/>He then mentioned the words, I <span class="underline ">then &amp; then only</span> made use
<br/>of words which you may find fault with, for all his
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>hidden anger of which I had in the note been informed by
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E.</span> came back to my mind &amp; ranged side by side with
<br/>his boasts of honesty. And I told him of it but I used no
<br/>epithet such as "you are an old man." I said you informed
<br/>me that you thought I wished to drive things all my own way
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>At that very time I was endeavouring to uphold your character
<br/>in the eyes of the <span class="">natives</span>, for when you were weak enough
<br/>to endeavour to make yourself <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">an</span> <span class="add  above">a source of</span> appeal I was refusing
<br/>to be one against you. These same seven men (one of
<br/>whom refused to obey me &amp; went to you), declared to me that
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>they had been cheated, and asked why I had brought a man
<br/>like you with me, I said no you are not cheated, you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>
<br/>yet understand wages. One said but all the people who
<br/>come from the southward tell<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">s</span> us that man is Satan
<br/>Now I was defending your character and telling them never
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>to come again to me to say a word against <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span>
<br/>at the very time you thought I was <span class="add  inline">˄</span> <span class="add  above">wishing to</span> driv<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">ing</span> things all my own
<br/>way. You insolently told me I added to let the watercourse
<br/>alone, &amp; you would carry it on for I was always cont<br/>-radicting you. Well you got it all your own way
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>&amp; from the point at which I was bitten by the lion, it
<br/>had all to be <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: dug">digged</span> over again I said all this but
<br/>no more on that subject &amp; I shall repeat it
    
    

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>I was then accused of having engaged <span class="">Mebaloe</span> privately. To this
<br/>I replied (but not before he had accused me of holding the sentiment
<br/>that no one should have authority over him but myself) that he
<br/>knew of my requesting you to give <span class="">Mebaloe</span> a public charge to make
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>no difference between him &amp; me. And that my sentiments were that
<br/>no one should have authority over a <span class="">native</span> who <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">had</span> none over
<br/>his own temper. You <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> are an example of what I mean
<br/>and the proof is you never speak out notwithstanding all your
<br/>boasts of honesty unless your temper boils over &amp; compels you
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I then asked why he had not spoken to me as an honest outspoken
<br/>man would have done before going to another to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: introduce">introdroduce</span>
<br/>for him a subject into the <span class="">committee</span>. I <span class="add  above"><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> prove</span><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">don't know</span> that
<br/>you did but it has always looked so to me. He denied it
<br/>point blank. I then gave him another instance of his
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>honesty. But I never said one word about his temper
<br/>or his honesty untill the subject was introduced by himself
<br/>He charged me first with bad temper by saying "my temper
<br/>was my ruin," which from him tickled me not a little
<br/>Every statement I made was introduced by himself But
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>why does he shift the ground of <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: controversy">controvery</span> from the
<br/>case of <span class="">Mapoleane</span> &amp; this nonentity sentence to what took
<br/>place entirely at the interview. I assure you I did not
<br/>say one word calculated to exasperate untill after I had
<br/>been informed that he had written to all the bretheren on
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the subjects before speaking to me. And had I not been
<br/>quite confounded by the unexpected explosion it is
<br/>probable I should have given him a great deal more
<br/>When coming away from the interview he asked me if I objected
<br/>to any statement in his <span class="">epistle</span> to the <span class="">Directors</span>. I said it had
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>got a twist through the whole of it &amp; that my proceedings
<br/>with respect to the <span class="">Interior</span> had had no reference to him for
<br/>as he might remember he did not know untill long after my
<br/>resolution with respect to this station whether or not to use
<br/>his own phrase he should still be <span class="">Moffat</span>'s lackey. Had he
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>not delivered <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E</span>'s message concerning her writing to
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> M.</span> I should have been able to bear most of what he
<br/>said But that with impeachment of my veracity <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">in</span>
<br/>what he knows to be the truth was rather beyond me
<br/>In conclusion on this subject I may state that whatever charges
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>refer to a period antecedent to our interview I protest that
<br/>except in the one case (of nonentity) about which I was informed
<br/>by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E.</span> I was not conscious of ever having offended 

    

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>either in word or deed. And that I should be informed immediately
<br/>if I ever did offend in either word or deed, was my pointed request
<br/>on that occasion. It is scarcely fair on <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> to jumble all together
<br/>viz.. what passed at the interview &amp; everything else he can think of.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">I feel most anxious to have an unravelling before bretheren
<br/>but I must be guided by what you think best as to going or staying
<br/>I feel very unwilling to <span class="underline ">go out to</span> a meeting and yet I feel very anxious
<br/>to be present at it. It cannot however be at that time if called
<br/>for my accommodation. December or January either would
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>prevent my going quite. I may say again that I am even more
<br/>willing than I was at last <span class="">com.</span> meeting to go to another tribe. I
<br/>should prefer <span class="">Sechele</span> to the Bahurutse but should be content
<br/>to go to the place where there is most hope of doing good. <span class="">Bube</span>
<br/>has always professed great friendship &amp; when here last week asked me
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>if I would not come &amp; live with him; <span class="">Sechele</span>, we met on
<br/>the path leading up to his town, &amp; after saluting <span class="">Mary</span> he said, Have
<br/>you come to teach us? I shall come to <span class="">Mabotsa</span> &amp; take you
<br/>away from <span class="">Moseelele</span> &amp; make you my teacher. When we talked
<br/>to him afterwards on many other subjects we found that he always 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>said just what a sensible man in his circumstances would <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">be expected to</span> say
<br/>He never said like <span class="">Bube</span> &amp; others. O I like the word of God, &amp;c.
<br/>But when he told us that he intended removing to a fountain called
<br/><span class="">Kolobeñ</span> as soon as he heard that the Matibele intended to come
<br/>that way no more, or were defeated, in order to get a missionary
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>His reasons were a missionary could help him in sickness
<br/>mend his gun, teach him to read, &amp; <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">'inthuta botlale</span> He seems
<br/>very fond of improvements and altogether a more likely subject
<br/>than any I have seen. He &amp; <span class="">Moiloe</span> resemble each other in

<br/>If I get in there <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> will be clever if he can hook me into

<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>giving to them any sort of what they will consider a
<br/>plausible explanation, is anger on account of appearing
<br/>to leave in discontent or if my residence were as near as <span class="">Bube</span>
<br/>I fear blame might be attached to me (if they removed nearer to
<br/>that locality) as having used improper influences to induce
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>them to that step. They will not come near <span class="">Sechele</span>. But
<br/>it might be different with <span class="">Bube</span> or <span class="">Moiloe</span>. I think
<br/>it would be right to make provision against the

    

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>possibility of blame. Certain remarks made by <span class="">natives</span> but to 
<br/>which I never return an answer induce me to believe that some
<br/>talk has taken place other than what a wellwisher to the cause should
<br/>like to hear. For instance repeated allusions to the gardens as mineᅳ
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>As having known me first &amp;c, without any connection; and one
<br/>said "Do you know what we said in the peecho. (I did not know
<br/>there had been a pico) "<span class="">Mosielele</span> said you were his father and if
<br/>you left this place so would he." I made no reply, but it has
<br/>made me think since. What can induce them to speak of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>gardens as mine when I have invariably declared that they are
<br/>not mine but those of the teachers for the time being for ever

<br/><p class="p ">The plough met with an accident, in getting the mould
<br/>board broken off <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> by the hinder bolt. An unseen

<br/>very well untill this evening when the foot board was broken

<br/>from the iron which <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receives">recieves</span> the share round a portion

<br/>me with the measurement horizontally of the distance between

<br/>I think I must have given the mould board too great
<br/>a lateral set for though well supported it broke off.
<br/>Can I fall heir to the other mould board belonging to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">this</span>
