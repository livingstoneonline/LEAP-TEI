<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Sir -</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 4 words ">                                </span>I am not far from <span class="">Loanda</span> and as I shall have very
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>little time to spend in writing there because my purse is light and
<br/><span class="">followers</span> numerous and hungry, I give you a few particulars now</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We have had a most tedious journey from the land of
<br/>the <span class="">Leeambye</span>. We went up the <span class="">Leeba</span> 40 or 50 miles then left
<br/>the canoes and went forward on ox back to the first chief of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Balonda called <span class="">Kabompo</span> or <span class="">Shinté</span>. He highly approved our
<br/>object in opening up a way for commerce into his country
<br/>and shewed his sincerity by giving us guides and sending
<br/>orders to all <span class="">his people</span> in the route to supply us with food.
<br/>This kindness hindered our progress for every village must have
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>time to prepare meal &amp;c. for us, but the rains hindered us

<br/>much more.  Never did I endure such drenchings, and all the
<br/>streams being swollen we had to ford many the water flowing
<br/>on the rustic bridges waist deep. Others we crossed by sticking
<br/>to the oxen the best <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">we</span><span class="add  above">way</span> we could and a few we made a regular  
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>swim of<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">f</span>. My Barotse, for with them alone I travelled did
<br/>not know I could swim and the first broad stream we came
<br/>to excited their fears on my account. "Now hold on fast by
<br/>the tail". <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Don't">Dont</span> let go" I intended to follow the injunction but
<br/>tail and all went so deep I thought it better to strike out
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>alone for the bank. and just as I reached it I was greatly
<br/>gratified to see a universal rush had been made for my
<br/>rescue. Their clothes were all floating down the stream and
<br/>two of them reached me breathless with the exertion they had
<br/>made. If we could march I got on very well. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> care
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>much for fatigue, but when compelled to stand still by
<br/>pouring rains. then fever laid hold with his strong fangs
<br/>on my inner man and lying in a little <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: gypsy">gipsey</span> tent with
<br/>everything damp or wet, was sore against the grain</p>

<br/><p class="p ">Frequent and most severe attacks of intermittent made me miserab<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: damage">[  ]</span>
<br/>weak. but I never lay by for that. and we managed to make
<br/>occasional progress. through a population &amp; country to which I can
<br/>offer you no comparison in the <span class="">South</span>. We came to a village every 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>few miles. sometimes passed 10 in a day. These were civil, how could
<br/>they be otherwise, the fellows were living in a Mahometan Paradis<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: damage">[ ]</span>
<br/>We often entered a village and when sitting on ox back could only see
<br/>the tops of the huts in a wilderness of weeds, By &amp; Bye the <span class="">villagers</span>
<br/>emerged from their lairs, men &amp; women each smoking a long pipe and
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>followed by crowds of children. Very little exertion is required to procure
<br/>the staff of life which in these parts is the Manioc. A part of the
<br/>Forest is cleared of brushwood and fires made round the larger
<br/>trees leave them standing dead. Cuttings of the manioc are inserted

<br/>in the ground and the earth drawn up around them. Maize bean
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Darth nuts &amp;c. are planted between and here we have a supply
<br/>of food for years The climate is so good they are either planti<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: damage">[  ]</span>
<br/>or reaping the whole year round. All the different grains, roots &amp;c.
<br/>may be seen at one time in every stage of growth. Indeed the
<br/>country generally is fertile in the extreme. and very beautiful
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>It is flat but lies in ridges or waves, the ridge of each
<br/>wave is covered with dense dank forest and the trough
<br/>a pleasant valley containing either a bog or stream in its
<br/>centre The <span class="">Boerish</span> Eden <span class="">Magaliesberg</span> will bear no comparis<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: damage">[  ]</span>
<br/>to this land for fertility and beauty. The forest trees shoot up
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to an enormous height as straight as arrows and all being
<br/>covered with white moss shew the humidity of the climate
<br/>would require no irrigation for English Wheat.<span class="space" title="space: 4 chars ">        </span>Through some of
<br/>these forest we could scarcely move on ox back. Swinging climbing
<br/>plants of from an inch to three or four in diameter abound.
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and when drizzling rain makes the darkness of the forest darker
<br/>we were often caught (<span class="underline ">more</span> Absalom) The ox when you attempt

<br/>often went out of the way or narrow winding path on purpose and
<br/>always tried to administer an effective kick to shew how he
<br/>would act if he had the up<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: blotting">[  ]</span>r hand. The country to the West
<br/>of that which we travelled through is called <span class="">Lobale</span> and was
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>impassable the water standing on its plains waist deep. We had
<br/>sometimes to make a divergence from our path in order to
<br/>avoid such and two or three times passed over plains 12 or 15
<br/>miles broad about 6 inches deep. other plains presented the appear<br/>ance of large rivers flowing fast towards the rivers and must
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>be the sources of the annual inundations of the Barotse &amp;c.
<br/>The water is always clear because rains fall on a dense mat
<br/>of grass only. The <span class="">Southern part of the <span class="">Lobale</span></span> is well peopled

<br/>but the plains being at other than the rainy season destitute
<br/>of streams have but a small population. The <span class="">East</span> is all 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>densely populated and pass by the name Balonda. They are idolators
<br/>near every village an idol is seen, a block of wood with a
<br/>rough human head carved on it or a lion made of clay
<br/>and two shells for eyes standing in a little shed. The people
<br/>when unsuccessful in any enterprise or sick beat a drum
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>before them all night. And they are otherwise very superstitious
<br/>They would not eat with us, not in our sight though
<br/>they took meat from us and eat it at home. When I saw
<br/>their numbers and thought of the vast multitudes there are in
<br/>this land all living without God and without hope I often
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>sat down with feelings of despair. When will they be supplied
<br/>with the <span class="">gospel</span> of Christ?</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As we approached the Portuguese settlements the people
<br/>became worse &amp; worse and at last instead of gifts of
<br/>food we were offered knocks on the head! The Chiboque for
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>instance are most outrageous <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: blackguards">blackgaurds</span>. We came to
<br/>them as quiet as <span class="">Quakers</span> and were spending Sunday on
<br/><span class="">Peace Society</span> principles when a whole tribe surrounded us



	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>fully armed with guns, arrows, spears and short swords. They
<br/>were all vociferating and brandishing their weapons simultaneously
<br/>I sat down and asked the chief to do the same and then demanding
<br/>silence requested to know what was the matter. Our crime consisted
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in one of <span class="">our men</span> when spitting allowing a small drop of the saliva
<br/>to fall on one of them. I replied if the chief could seriously say such
<br/>was a crime I was willing to pay a fine. (On such frivolous
<br/>pretexts we had often to pay enormous fines) He accepted one
<br/>but his warriors rejected it and demanded one thing after another
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>untill by demanding one of our number to be sold as a <span class="">slave</span>
<br/>we saw their intention was regular plunder, and armed our<br/>selves for the worst. They feared my arms alone, indeed we
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">we</span>were as a <span class="">company</span> unprepared for fighting but armed 
<br/>as we were not a man of chief or counsellors would have
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>escaped the first onset. We determined to let them shed the
<br/>first drop of blood and sat looking at them in all
<br/>their heathenish shouting. This resolute bearing made them more
<br/>reasonable so they accepted an ox and gave us two or three
<br/>pounds of the flesh to shew they were of a generous disposition
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>after all. We were often so treated and at last no passage
<br/>allowed past a town or village without paying for it. I
<br/>paid away nearly all I had. oxen for provisions &amp; riding
<br/>clothes razors spoons, &amp;c . Then we all got angry, chafed
<br/>in mind <span class="underline ">a</span>nd hungry and replied angrily to their demands
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>Sometimes I was furious and would have fought but
<br/><span class="">my companions</span> were more pacific stripping themselves
<br/>of their ornaments &amp; paying for passage At other times
<br/>they were on the bloody key and I was quakerish and
<br/>we rose up by night and passed our enemies expecting
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>an assault in every thicket and glen we came to.
<br/>And After all I thank God sincerely in that he prevented
<br/>us from shedding human blood.</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><p class="p ">When we reached the <span class="">Quango</span> I had made up my mind to part
<br/>with my bedding for a passage but we were prevented by
<br/>a small tribe from approaching the ferry. I could not
<br/>pay both tribe and ferry with what I had remaining
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and there they laughed at us with their teeth filed to
<br/>a point and hair elaborately plaited &amp; ornamented
<br/>"you must just go back the way you came ", "if you
