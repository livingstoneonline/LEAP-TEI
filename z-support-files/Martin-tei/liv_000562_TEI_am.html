<br/><p class="p ">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The Lord having in tender mercy restored me
<br/>to my wanted health. I have much cause for gratitude in
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>being able again to communicate with you. The affliction
<br/>from which I have been raised was both painful and pro-
<br/>-tracted. As the wounds discharging profusely prevented
<br/>the union of the fragments into which the bone was
<br/>broken and these having seldom been properly secured
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>every motion of the body produced a grating irritation
<br/>which reacted on the wounds. But through the mercy
<br/>of our Heavenly Father the whole has healed well beyond
<br/>my most sanguine expectation, and the bone is perfectly
<br/>straight and firm. It was a severe trial of patience to
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>be laid aside so long and at a period too when every
<br/>assistance that can be rendered is required. But though
<br/>I fear I have not learned all that was intended by the
<br/>chastisement, I trust I have realized much which though
<br/>I knew I did not fully feel before. And I hope I am
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>now more anxious than ever that my spared life may
<br/>be entirely consecrated to the glory of my great Deliverer.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The Bakhatla are at present busily engaged in
<br/>removing from their former location to the spot on which
<br/>we reside, and it is cheering <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">to</span> observe <span class="add gray below">^</span> <span class="add gray above">that</span> the subordinate
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>chiefs have with one exception chosen sites for their villages
<br/>conveniently near to that on which we <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, hand: #U; type: strikethrough; ">purpose</span> <span class="add  above">propose</span> to erect
<br/>the permanent premises. We purpose to build a house
<br/>to serve as school and meeting house as soon as possible
<br/>and then we hope our efforts to impart a knowledge of
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>saving truth will assume a more regular form than at
<br/>present. <span class="add gray inline">[</span>Among a people as degraded as Bechuanas, no
<br/>very decided result can be expected unless there is a continuous
<br/>application of the truth to their minds, and for this mission<br/>-aries in <span class="">Africa</span> have superior advantages to those in countries
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>more densely populated. There the <span class="">mass of the population</span>

	

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>cannot be addressed very frequently or the address followed by
<br/>continued and pointed appeals to the same individuals. While
<br/>here we generally have opportunities of directing the highs on
<br/>to the same minds continuously. And it appears by the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Divine blessing to ensure greater <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, hand: #U; type: strikethrough; ">results</span> <span class="add gray above">efforts</span> than desultory efforts
<br/>between which considerable periods intervene. Conversion among
<br/>Bechuanas is in general by no means a quick process.
<br/>Their depravity being <span class="underline ">subnatural</span>, some time elapses ere they
<br/>are raised to the level of sinners in other countries and then
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>they seem to require time again before they can accomodate their
<br/>minds to the change of thought and motive. There may be
<br/>a leaning to the side of holiness for a long period but
<br/>generally a thorough revolution is wrought out before their
<br/>convictions become embodied in action. <span class="add gray inline">[</span>I visited the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Bakhatla frequently before the establishment of the <span class="">mission</span>
<br/>But it was not untill my fifth visit that sufficient
<br/>confidence was inspired to draw forth a cordial invitation
<br/>for me to settle among them. And this is the only good I can
<br/>ascertain effected by my itneraries to them. The reason
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>seems to have been <span class="add gray below">^</span> <span class="add gray above">that</span> too long periods intervened between
<br/>each journey to produce any lasting impression. And this
<br/>is not to be wondered at, for nothing can exceed the grovelling
<br/>earthliness of their minds. They seem to have fallen as low in
<br/>the scale of humanity as human nature can. At some remote
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>period their ancestors appear to have been addicted to animal
<br/>worship for each tribe is called by some animal. By it they
<br/>swear and in general neither kill nor eat it, <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: alleging">alledging</span> as a cause
<br/>that these animals are the friends of their tribe. Thus the <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">word</span> Batlapi"
<br/>literally translated is "<span class="underline ">They</span> (of the) <span class="underline ">Fish</span> Bakwain "<span class="underline ">They</span> (of the)
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="underline ">Crocodile</span>". Bakhatla, "<span class="underline ">They</span> (of the) <span class="underline ">monkey</span>" &amp;c <span class="add gray inline">[</span>But if the
<br/>conjecture is not wrong they have degenerated from even that
<br/>impure form of worship and the wisest among them have now
<br/>no knowledge of it but suppose some of their ancestors must
<br/>have been called by these names. They have reached the extreme of
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>degradation. When we compare the Bakhatla with the inhabit<br/>-ants around <span class="">Lattakoo</span>, the latter appear quite civilized, and
<br/>their present state of partial enlightenment shows that the
<br/>introduction of the <span class="">gospel</span> into a country has a mighty influence

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>even over those by whom it is either not known or rejected. I am
<br/>not now to be understood as speaking of the <span class="">converts</span> nor of the new
<br/>phases of character the transforming power of the <span class="">gospel</span> has developed
<br/>among them. But I allude to the unconnected and to those other
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>than saving influences of Christianity which so materially modify
<br/>the social system at home. On many these influences have
<br/>operated for years and they have not operated in vain. Hence
<br/>the mass of the population in the <span class="">Kuruman district</span> are not now
<br/>in that state the <span class="">Gospel</span> found them, and in which the poor
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Bakhatla now are. There the existence of Deity is tacitly admitted
<br/>by nearly all. <span class="add gray below">^</span> <span class="add gray above">those who form</span> The exceptions <span class="add gray below">^</span> <span class="add gray above">to this rule</span> denying it rather on account of
<br/>attachment to their lusts, than in sober seriousness. <span class="add gray inline">[</span>And I
<br/>believe the number is but small who have not the idea floating
<br/>on their minds, that this life is but the beginning of our
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>existence and death but one event in a life which is
<br/>everlasting. But the Bakhatla have had no thoughts on
<br/>the subject. Their mind is darkness itself, and no
<br/>influences have ever operated on it but those which
<br/>have left it supremely selfish. it is only now that <span class="">Christians</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>have begun to endeavour to stop the stream which has swept <span class="add gray below">^</span> <span class="add gray above">them</span>
<br/>generation after generation <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">of them</span> into darkness. And I may <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: hole">[      ]</span>
<br/>Holy Spirit aid our <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, hand: #U; rend: gray; type: strikethrough; ">efforts</span> <span class="add gray above">endeavours</span>. For without this mighty power all
<br/>human efforts will be but labour in vain. That power exerted
<br/>over Bechuanas - raising them from the extreme of degradation-
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>and transforming them into worshippers of the Living God constitutes
<br/><span class="underline ">the</span> wonder and <span class="doubleunderline "/> cause for gratitude in the <span class="">Bechuana mission</span><span class="add gray inline">]</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our <span class="">native</span> assistant <span class="">Mebaloe</span> has been of considerable value
<br/>to the <span class="">mission</span>. In endeavouring to save my life he nearly
<br/>lost his own for he was caught and wounded severely. But
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>both before our being laid aside and since recovery he has
<br/>shown great willingness to be useful. The cheerful manner
<br/>in which he engages with us in manual labour on the
<br/>station. And his affectionate addresses to his <span class="">countrymen</span>
<br/>are truly gratifying. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> took him to several villages
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>near the <span class="">Kurrechane</span> lately in order to introduce him to his
<br/>work and I intend to depart tomorrow for the same purpose
<br/>in several villages of <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">the</span> Makone, situated N.E. of this. In all there
<br/>may be a dozen considerable villages situated at convenient
<br/>distances around us and we each purpose to visit them statedly

<br/>it would be of immense advantage to the cause had we many such
<br/>agents. But after being assured by bretheren on the spot whom
<br/>I presumed to be intimately acquainted with the state of the <span class="">mission</span>.
<br/>that many such could be got: but after most earnest pleading
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span> assurances of support from my friends at
<br/>home. I am sorry to say I cannot succeed according to my
<br/>desire. Suitable individuals are generally so wedged and dovetailed
<br/>among their relatives, I fear some time must yet elapse ere
<br/>that means of spreading the <span class="">gospel</span> can be extensively brought
    

<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>into operation. Still, believing that it is extremely well
<br/>adapted to the state of this country. And having seen that
<br/>it has been extensively blessed for the conversion of souls
<br/>I shall never lose sight of it. And constantly pray that
<br/>God may incline the hearts of his <span class="">converts</span> to feel more
