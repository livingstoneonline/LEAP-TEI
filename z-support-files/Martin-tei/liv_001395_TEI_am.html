<br/><p class="p left">My dear M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Blanche
<br/><span class="space" title="space: 11 chars ">                      </span>I ought to have written
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>you long ago in acknowledgement
<br/>of your very kind &amp; truly useful &amp;
<br/>handsome present. It was not 
<br/>without many a sore tug at my 
<br/>conscience either, but I have been
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>so occupied that I really could not
<br/>perform that duty. I was provided
<br/>with a naval officer to assist in 
<br/>the navigation of this river, but
<br/>the gentleman thinking that we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>could not do without him took
<br/>on such airs about the position
<br/>he ought to occupy though incapable
<br/>of making the simplest scientific
<br/>observations that we were obliged
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to send him about his business.
<br/>I then became "skipper" myself
<br/>and as we have been furnished
<br/>with a badly constructed engine
    
    

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>my time has been swallowed up with
<br/>pursuits I never contemplated on leaving
<br/><span class="">England</span>. These have prevented me from
<br/>doing my duty to many of my friends
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>at home. Some of the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: hard-hearted">hard hearted</span>
<br/>will never forgive me but such
<br/>I conclude you are not or else you
<br/>would never have spontaneously
<br/>served me in the way you have
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>done. I value the revolver very
<br/>highly and entreat you to accept
<br/>my warmest thanks for it and
<br/>for the kindly feelings which 
<br/>prompted your generous present.
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I have not yet had an opportunity
<br/>of trying it on game. I have been
<br/>too much confined to the ship.
<br/>but I feel sure it will be an
<br/>exceedingly useful instrument. The 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>stock enables one to take a steady 
<br/>aim and the size of the ball is
<br/>sufficient for all small animals.
<br/>About ten days ago we were up the
<br/><span class="">River Shire</span> 100 miles and came
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>among enormous herds of Elephants
<br/>on a swampy plain through which

    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>the river winds giving off many
<br/>departing &amp; re-entering branches. We
<br/>chased some of them with the steamer
<br/>and but for an unlucky storm
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of rain which set in when we caught
<br/>one in the water we should have
<br/>secured him. It was too large of
<br/>course to try a revolver on but
<br/>some weapon of the kind with a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>larger ball would surely have
<br/>been very effective. We gave him
<br/>many shots with the Enfield rifle.
<br/>Then several days afterwards found
<br/>him lame and plied him with the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>same but lost him in the storm
<br/>Twice we were within fifty yards &amp;
<br/>were very anxious to have him
<br/>as fuel for our engine. The plain
<br/>was 20 or 30 miles broad and not
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a tree could be got near the river
<br/>The bones of another elephant which
<br/>the <span class="">natives</span> had picked clean helped
<br/>us nicely, hence our desire to get
<br/>the one referred to. The <span class="">shire</span> is
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>deep and well adapted for navigation
<br/>We were the first visitors the people
<br/>ever had &amp; they seemed very suspicious
    
    

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>but brought fowls bananas and cotton
<br/>yarn for sale. They use bows and poisoned
<br/>arrows and only once offered to shoot
<br/>at us. There was something comical
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in seeing them place their arrows
<br/>ready to shoot utterly unconscious of
<br/>the nature of the arms we carried. We
<br/>had no encounter - never had &amp; hope
<br/>we never may, but it is well to be pre-
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>-pared. and thanks to you I am very much
<br/>so, but still, not so much as to make
<br/>me in the least desirous of using a
<br/>weapon against my fellow men.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">This river is filling now and a goodly
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>sight it is to see. A large vessel could
<br/>now, as I stated at home come up with
<br/>ease to <span class="">Tette</span>. I chose the healthy time
<br/>of year for coming, though that
<br/>was not the most favourable for
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>navigation, and you will be glad to 
<br/>hear that my precautions have
<br/>been completely successful - We have
<br/>had no fever except among the
<br/><span class="">Kroomen</span>. You will remember the
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>case of the <span class="">Great <span class="">Niger</span> Expedition</span> - the 
<br/>difference is cause for much thank-
<br/>-fulness to the Almighty disposer of
<br/>events. Please present my kind
<br/>salutations to your son and believe
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>yours gratefully</p>
