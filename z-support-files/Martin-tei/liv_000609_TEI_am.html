<br/><p class="p left">My Dear Father
<br/>We were very sorry to hear of the toss 
<br/>your system <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> from the mill. The pain must
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>have been intense for an extensive laceration
<br/>is of all others the most irritating. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ashton</span>
<br/>seems to have done his duty in the surgical line
<br/>the only difference I should have suggested in
<br/>the treatment might not have pleased you as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it would have been a simplification and
<br/>might have appeared as doing less than duty
<br/>You ought to have had a strong opiate as 
<br/>soon as possible in order to allay or
<br/>prevent the effects of the shock on the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>system. Morphia perhaps repeated for a day
<br/>or two and afterwards if pain prevented
<br/>sleep, the wound dressed with lint dipped
<br/>in water after the bleeding ceased or suppurati<span class="add  above">-on</span>
<br/>fairly begun. Till then nothing but dry
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>lint is necessary. If there is too much
<br/>inflammation set up in the wound and
<br/>it looks red &amp; angry (Like <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> R</span>) warm 
<br/>water frequently poured over the lint and
<br/>evaporation prevented by the whole being covered

<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">covered</span> over with oil silk or oil cloth and a 
<br/>little cooling medicine will soon relieve it and
<br/>is far better than poultices. The wound 
<br/>should never be washed. Pus is the best
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>salve. In dressing the skin around alone
<br/>needs cleaning - the sponge ought not to
<br/>touch the red flesh. If the new parts
<br/>springing up use above the surrounding 
<br/>skin or are too large &amp; flabby a little of  
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>what salves are usually composed, Zinc
<br/>Alum.<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">lunar</span> caustic &amp;c may be dissolved
<br/>in the water and applied Nature does all
<br/>the water dressing is now used more than
<br/>any other where people are willing to pay
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>without a farrago of doctoring and is
<br/>asserted by those who have the best 
<br/>means of judging as better than any other
<br/>Hope you will never need to apply it on 
<br/>your own person. Shall not be surprised
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>if you feel numbness &amp;c in your little &amp; 
<br/>next finger for some time to come. It
<br/>was a mercy the arm was not lost you 
<br/>will be obliged to spend your time in 
<br/>better work than roofing &amp; other manual

<br/>labours. That which although all very necessary
<br/>are not to be compared to the effects of translations
<br/>for these will be known when our stations
<br/>swept away &amp; we all dead &amp; rotten. I am glad
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to think as it is the left arm you may be just
<br/>as useful as ever. I have got up the roof
<br/>and <span class="">Mebola</span> is now at the third row in thatching
<br/>I felt very nervous in roofing this time in conseq<br/>uence of a piece of lath breaking &amp; setting me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>aswinging in the air like a pendulum. All my
<br/>operations aloft were conducted after that in  
<br/>the crawling order and in perpetual fear of 
<br/>coming down by the run. The walls
<br/>in consequence of long detention at <span class="">Mabotsa</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>were sadly dilapidated on my return and 
<br/>had we enjoyed the usual supply of rain 
<br/>we should have found them prostrate. Is
<br/>it the prince of the power of the air who 
<br/>avenges drought at <span class="">Chonuane</span> this year
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>As was last season at <span class="">Mabotsa</span>? If he has
<br/>the power I suppose we may say He has the 
<br/>will &amp; no mistake. The corn is short 
<br/>burned &amp; shooting into ear at about 2 feet
<br/>from the ground and I suppose many think 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>we are the cause</p>

<br/><p class="p ">We have so many clouds around us I believe
<br/>we are to be favoured with success soon 
<br/>And I feel the more inclined to stick to

<br/>for the good word of seven or even seventeen 
<br/>ladies, for though I liked &amp; do still love 
<br/>the Bakhatla the prospects are so much 
<br/>more encouraging, here there is no com<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>-parison. This although in addition contentions 
<br/>between the tribes. <span class="">Edwards</span> dirt &amp;c I have got 
<br/>the <span class="">Boers</span> about my ears. I send a note we 
<br/>got last week, almost if I understand it right  
<br/>prohibiting farther operations without their 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>sanction. As they seem to know perfectly 
<br/>of this station and are only five days distant 
<br/>We thought it would be imprudent to take 
<br/>no notice of their mandate so I answered 
<br/>shortly in English by informing them  
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of my object. An object which they 
<br/>as professing <span class="">Christians</span> approve (?) and 
<br/>which they I hoped would endeavour to promote

<br/>egotism before I ever saw you in this country 
<br/>I remember having considerable dislike to you

<br/>deploring crocodile strain I thought the men 
<br/>really mourning <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">&amp; praying</span> over your frailties. As however

<br/><p class="p ">As for <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> </span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Ross</span> I feel strongly inclined 
<br/>to expose their conduct towards me. I believed

<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and when I looked back after our arrival at 
<br/><span class="">Kuruman</span> I felt humbled that I had not 
<br/>been more patient of insult &amp;c than I had been 
<br/>I thought I should have borne more and 
<br/>have uniformly taken the blame in part 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>upon myself. After accusing me of an 
<br/>intention "to impose on his wife", calling me 
<br/>"a liar" when I denied it &amp; repeating the 
<br/>insult in several ways. I could <span class="underline ">not</span> esteem 
<br/>him. My heart burned with indignation 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>for I was conscious of just as little inclination 
<br/>towards his wife as I now have towards
<br/>my grandmothers cat. Yet I felt distressed

	

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>that being a missionary I had these feelings. Many
<br/>a sleepless night I spent &amp; wished I were not

<br/>I tried to subdue my feelings &amp; never mentioned 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: anything">any thing</span> to any one. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Edwards</span> has repeatedly

<br/>pass over before she began and made statements 
<br/>respecting me which to use <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E</span>'s own words 
<br/>"made us afraid of you" And - that I never 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>said one word about the <span class="">Ross</span>es for more 
<br/>than three months. Why did I then begin? 
<br/>Because <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span></span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E</span> then began to tell me all
<br/>that they had heard from the <span class="">Ross</span>es about me  
<br/>their statements being gross misrepresentations 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I was compelled to tell my way of viewing the 
<br/>subject. The <span class="">Ross</span>es went on month 
<br/>after month retailing scandal <span class="add  below">˅</span> <span class="add  above">against me</span> &amp; that was 
<br/>just as regularly reretailed to me at table 
<br/>untill I was sick of it. I would have spoken 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to the <span class="">Ross</span>es about it But was so disgusted 
<br/>with them I could not. This continuous 
<br/>scandalizing which I bore as a nail in my 
<br/>shoe for two years determined on no 
<br/>account to quarrel again I called to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>my friends and to <span class="">Inglis</span> amongst the

<br/><p class="p ">As a specimen of the details with which I was furnished

<br/>in birth as <span class="">Rachel</span> did not know how to deliver

<br/>thanked meᅳ They need not have told a lie
