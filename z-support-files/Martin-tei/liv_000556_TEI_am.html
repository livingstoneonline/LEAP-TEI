<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Sir
<br/>I am in very different circumstances
<br/>now from those in which I expected to have addressed
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>from our new station, the lions here are very
<br/>numerous &amp; very troublesome and besides having
<br/>attacked us here &amp; destroyed some of the cattle of <span class="">our
<br/>people</span> one of them destroyed 9 sheep &amp; goats in
<br/>broad day light on a little eminence opposite our
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>hut last <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: wednesday">wendnesday</span>. The <span class="">natives</span> came screaming
<br/>to us as we were engaged in the water course and
<br/>as all operations were immediately suspended
<br/>I very imprudently returned across the valley
<br/>in order to encourage them to destroy him. This
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>very nearly cost me my life for after he was
<br/>wounded he rushed down bit <span class="">Mabalwe</span> badly on the 
<br/>thigh, another <span class="">native</span> on the shoulder &amp; myself on
<br/>the arm, the humerus is splintered &amp; his teeth have
<br/>produced deep wounds which may trouble me for a
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>long time. Had it been directly in the way of duty
<br/>I should not have cared for the pains, but
<br/>I have not that consideration to compare myself by
<br/>it was not so contrary to my regular rules
<br/>of acting I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know what induced me to go
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>however I have great cause for thankfulness



	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>that I escaped with my life He shook me as
<br/>a cat does a mouse &amp; had the mercy of the Lord
<br/>not prevented could easily have torn me to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: pieces">peices</span>
<br/>I am sorry this event has happened
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>now for it gives our friends the <span class="">Edwards</span>
<br/>trouble which various circumstances render
<br/>them ill able to bear - If you are writing to 
<br/>the <span class="">Directors</span> Perhaps you might give them the
<br/>substance of the above account I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>what they will think of me after this but it
<br/>seems to me we ought to tell them our misfortunes
<br/>and the causes of them too, faithfully. --</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Before I met with this misfortune I
<br/>thought of requesting to purchase from you
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>an <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">adage</span>, large handsaw, the one I have is very
<br/>small, a common axe or two, with any other
<br/>tools either smithy or carpenters you have spare
<br/>I think I may still request them for it is fort<br/>unately the left arm that is injured so I shall
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>be able to work with the right while that is still
<br/>weak.</p>

<br/>is partly dependent on me &amp; as in the
