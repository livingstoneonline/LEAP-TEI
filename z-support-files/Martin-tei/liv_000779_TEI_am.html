<br/>in a fair way now for effecting my escape
<br/>I could not get drivers - people were all

<br/>arrangements with two <span class="">Hottentots</span> and
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>think I shall be off positively before the

<br/>occurred have prevented me falling into
<br/><span class="">Boerish</span> hands so I am thankful and
<br/>indulge the hope that God has still some
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>little work for me to do - The belief that
<br/>my hindrances from the <span class="">Cape</span> off to 
<br/>the <span class="">Kuruman</span> are providential makes
<br/>me submit with a good grace -</p>

<br/>it of course - They get £200 per annum
<br/>and the <span class="">state</span> appoints the ministers - or
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>has all the patronage in its hands - our
<br/>connection with the <span class="">society</span> is half as
<br/>slight again for we only get £100</p>
