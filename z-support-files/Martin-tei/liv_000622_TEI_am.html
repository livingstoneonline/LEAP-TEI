<br/>tomorrow morning I must write you a note
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>But I have but little inclination to

<br/>He could scarcely breathe for one day - the
<br/>mucus collected so abundantly in the air

<br/>any effect on the complaint. He has
<br/>constant heat of skin - loses flesh &amp;
<br/>is much troubled with his cough
<br/>Remedies which usually produce a
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>speedy change do nothing in his case
<br/>the cough gradually sounds worse &amp;
<br/>worse. I am sorry I cannot
<br/>speak of the favourable symptoms
<br/>I can only hope they will soon
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>appear. His cheerfulness is quite gone</p>

<br/>I have been shortening the bands of the waggon
<br/>succeeded well with those of the "naves"
<br/>except making one rather too little. Three

<br/>send it in (when cold) I broke it although
<br/>the weld was one of the best made. I
<br/>take it slowly welding one side then
<br/>the other. What is the proper distance
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to place the band from the hole of the
<br/>bellows? ought the centre of the band
<br/>or the lower edge to be opposite
<br/>the hole? I placed the band sometimes
<br/>two sometimes three inches from the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>hole but could not get a heat over
<br/>the whole part to be welded. It either
<br/>went over the upper or lower edge
<br/>My friends here say you put pieces of
<br/>stone under the band to bring it into
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a proper position What that is I
