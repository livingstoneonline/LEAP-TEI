<br/><p class="p ">I have as you will 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>see by the date remained here considerably
<br/>longer than I intended, but having
<br/>arrived <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">here</span> with a severe affection
<br/>of the spleen a consequence of the 
<br/>Fever in the <span class="">Quilimane delta</span> and
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>finding that this climate <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">was</span> proving
<br/>curative I have delayed my departure
<br/>till the present time. I have been
<br/>most kindly and hospitably entertained
<br/>by <span class="">Major General Hay</span> and as his
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>house is situated about five miles
<br/>from <span class="">Port Luis</span> and on an elevated 
<br/>spot with a cool climate it has
<br/>answered the end of completely
<br/>curing me. I had but two returns
    
    

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>of tertian and the pain in the spleen
<br/>is quite gone. I am ready to go
<br/>back to <span class="">Africa</span> again. Thanks to 
<br/>the Author of all our mercies, not
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>forgetting the good kindhearted
<br/>man with whom I am living</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have had another object in
<br/>view besides health viz. a wish
<br/>to see the <span class="">Commodore</span> and thank 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>him for his kindness. I wished
<br/>also to talk to him about <span class="">Africa</span>
<br/>as I intend to work still in that
<br/>poor <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: trodden-down">trodden down</span> country even
<br/>without the aid of our <span class="">Society</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>if I can only get back again
<br/>I got a letter at <span class="">Quilimane</span>. The only
<br/>one since I saw you last and I am
    
    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>informed that "the <span class="">Directors</span> are restricted
<br/>in their power of aiding plans connected
<br/>only remotely with the spread of the <span class="">gospel</span>"
<br/>And also that even "though certain obstacles
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>(as fever, Tsetse &amp;c) should prove sur-
<br/>-mountable the financial circumstances
<br/>of the <span class="">Society</span> are not such as to warrant
<br/>the hope that it would be in a position
<br/>within any definite period to undertake
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>untried remote and difficult fields of
<br/>labour" As these statements are
<br/>embalmed in some flattering sentences
<br/>of approbation respecting my late
<br/>efforts in opening up the continent
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to the sympathies of the <span class="">friends of
<br/>christianity</span> I suppose that it is 
<br/>intended to send me to some of the 
<br/>tried, neat, and easy fields where I 
<br/>may wax fat and kick like <span class="">Jeshurun</span>


	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>As the proposition to leave the untried
<br/>remote and difficult fields of labour
<br/>as they have been ever since our
<br/>saviour died for the poor sinners
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>who inhabit them involves my
<br/>certain severance from the <span class="">L.M.S.</span>
<br/>and the attempt to support myself
<br/>and return in the best way I can
<br/>I have given a <span class="">certificate</span> to <span class="">George
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Fleming</span> for the money viz. 500
<br/>Spanish dollars and fifty <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: sovereigns">sovreigns</span>
<br/>which you sent and which I told
<br/>you in another letter I meant to
<br/>retain for the homeward voyage
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I go "overland" because I have a 
<br/>hope of a free passage part of
<br/>the way. If I am not successful
<br/>in obtaining that then there will be

<br/>which does not seem to have been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>repaired according to promise &amp;
<br/>will not sell for much. I managed 
<br/>to get through all my clothing &amp;c &amp;c.
<br/>before I got to <span class="">Quilimane</span> but have

<br/>£50 of debts of honour to <span class="">black men</span>
<br/>so am not exactly in the position
<br/>of the prodigal returning to his father
<br/>but am poorer considerably
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>than when I landed in <span class="">Africa</span>
<br/>some sixteen years ago. Yet I shall
<br/>leave you without abuse of any sort.
<br/>the <span class="">Directors</span> have always treated me
<br/>well and I shall always remember
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>you all with affection</p>


	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/><p class="p ">I am sorry <span class="">Fleming</span> was engaged
<br/>so firmly as in the agreement - I
<br/>cannot get rid of it. He was entered
<br/>as Captain's servant at <span class="">Quilimane</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receives">recieves</span> about 1/6 <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="note  vertical">[about £2 per month]</span> a day for that  
<br/>but says "that is nothing, he is 
<br/>engaged at £10. per month till he
<br/>gets to the <span class="">Cape</span>" and will insist on
<br/>the fulfillment of the written agreement
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I wished to make an arrangement
<br/>with a Captain going to the <span class="">Cape</span>
<br/>whereby his services would be taken
<br/>as part of his passage money but
<br/>he objects to this because "they would
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>make him do everything" i.e.
<br/>in working the ship. I proposed
<br/>to stipulate for personal service
<br/>alone to the Captain but he said
<br/>to let the passage be paid and</p>


	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/><p class="p ">no terms made respecting his service
<br/>the agreement specifies services to 
<br/><span class="">Captain Peyton</span> and that he is to be
<br/>under my <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: control">controul</span> but he sticks
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to the £10 per month as the part most
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: agreeable">agreable</span> to his ideas of the proper ful -
<br/>fillment of his duties. I would
<br/>have sent him off at once on
<br/>our arrival here but the com-
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>modore was expected daily and
<br/><span class="">Captain Peyton</span> wished to take
<br/>him to the <span class="">Cape</span> free of expense.
<br/>It is unfortunate that <span class="">Fleming</span> was
<br/>engaged at all as he is a most
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>unlikely person to go anywhere in
<br/>the face of danger but this you
<br/>could not know, and I should
<br/>probably <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">have</span> been as much <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: misled">mislead</span> in

<br/>on the way to <span class="">Linyanti</span>. He requires one
<br/>on whom he can lean - deprived of
<br/>that he has no <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: self-reliance">self reliance</span> whatever. 
<br/>I am sorry too that my statements
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>respecting going to <span class="">England</span> were not
