<br/><p class="p left">My Dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The present note must be as 
<br/>hurried as any of yours. <span class="">Mebaloe</span> goes out on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Monday in order to bring home his wife 
<br/>before he is required for thatching and as 
<br/>I have returned here on horseback and go 
<br/>again tomorrow there is no time for corresp<br/>onding Everything you sent so far as we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>have been able to ascertain has come safely 
<br/>and we thank you heartily for the whole 
<br/>I heard at <span class="">Chonuane</span> that <span class="">Mary</span> had headache
<br/>&amp; when the <span class="">Griqua</span> messenger came I did not 
<br/>require any pressing to accept the invitation 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>she was better before I came but I mean 
<br/>to purchase a horse so as to come here 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: more often">oftener</span>. The walls are three feet high, this 
<br/>is to be the level of the floor, the outside 
<br/>to be raised for some distance around the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>house in order to avoid damp. We 
<br/>are 19 in all &amp; hope soon to get up 
<br/>our tabernacle. The heifer which came 
<br/>from <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Obonye√±</span></span> &amp; any others you can con<br/>veniently procure shall be glad of by

<br/>the children here come to be taught by <span class="">Mary</span> at 
<br/>the house. <span class="">Sechele</span> acquired a perfect know<br/>ledge of the alphabet, large small &amp; mixed 
<br/>in two days. I try to get breakfast before 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>sun-rise &amp; keep school in the Kotla as soon 
<br/>after as possible so as to have all set agoing 
<br/>in good time in the morning. I am extremely 
<br/>sorry at having involved you in the unpleasant 
<br/>affair with <span class="">Edwards</span>. It was entirely by a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>mistake on my part. The appearance of 
<br/>the man &amp; his communication produced 
<br/>a sort of bewilderment and as we were 
<br/>on the power of starting for <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s</span> I  
<br/>was willing to give him a frank statement 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>before we did so &amp; in doing so wrote with 
<br/>more hurry than such a matter required 
<br/>I read over yours hurriedly &amp; thought that 
<br/>the paper was official and it was not 
<br/>till a <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">&amp;c perusal</span> of yours convinced me
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I was wrong that I knew the error I 
<br/>had made.  He however takes it 
<br/>for granted that you have informed me 
<br/>of everything for he begins his note by 
<br/>"you have been informed that I applied &amp;c" 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>but he has not the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: ingenuity">engenuity</span> to allow anything 

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>If he can make a peg of it on which to hang 
<br/>an accusation, and by the way I may mention 
<br/>that I have nothing to do with his application 
<br/>for advice. The form in which he now 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>puts his absence from the ordinances &amp; station 
<br/>we left this as he informed me in his note 
<br/>in order to submit the affairs to a <span class="">committee</span> 
<br/>of the bretheren. I do not feeling willing 
<br/>to allow him to make turn rounds as he has 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>done in the affair. The charges as he now 
<br/>puts them are <span class="underline ">false</span> Not one of them 
<br/>has he put in a plain straightforward way 
<br/>so I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> see what I can do except 
<br/>give a fair straightforward narration of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>all that I know on the subject. It 
<br/>will be <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">prolix</span> but these "charges" <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>con<br/>tain a tithe of the differences . . there is 
<br/>not a word about the "dishonest dishonour<br/>able mischievious conduct". "The going to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">natives</span>" in the garden. The employing <span class="">Mebaloe</span>
<br/>privately &amp;c &amp;c and by the way you need 
<br/>not suspect the <span class="">Directors</span> will imagine 
<br/>my declining to have <span class="">Mokoteri</span> in on 
<br/>your account. My declining to employ 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>not only one but everyone I shall

	

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>attribute to one of the proper causes viz.
<br/>that there is not the least probability of my 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span> that cooperation without which 
<br/>my single efforts would be futile. Send 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Paul</span></span> to <span class="">Poe</span> and whatever your motives 
<br/>may be in reality. Before twelve months 
<br/>pass over you may have as I have 
<br/>had from my beloved coadjutor all 
<br/>manner of motives kindly laid at your 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>door. Unfortunately <span class="">my letters</span> for <span class="">England</span>
<br/>are at <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span></span>. I shall leave that for 
<br/>the <span class="">Directors</span>  open. Please peruse it &amp; 
<br/>tell me what you think of it, I thought 
<br/>at one time that I ought not to say a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>word about <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> untill the <span class="">committee</span> 
<br/>had decided. And that has made me delay 
<br/><span class="">Mokoteri</span>'s affair longer than I intended 
<br/>or wished. The subject of my <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">leaving</span>
<br/>&amp; of <span class="">Mebaloe</span> &amp; of others are so connected 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>dovetailed I found I could not write 
<br/>without taking them in. I hope your 
<br/>promise to present <span class="">my former letters</span> does not 
<br/>apply to this. If it does you may stop <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">that</span>
<br/>till you think proper

<br/>2<span class="sup ">d</span> sheet. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Lemue</span> seems rather sulky in his 
<br/>answers to what I wrote - does not wish to 
<br/>say anything more on the subject. I did not 
<br/>wish him to begin. "<span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Langa</span> thinks the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>ideas of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> </span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E</span> are very much exaggerated 
<br/>&amp; that they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> seem to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: perceive">percieve</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">to</span> what their con<br/>duct will lead."</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We are very happy to hear that <span class="">Robert</span> tries to 
<br/>improve. What he does is very commendable but 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he seems to want a guide in his studies, <span class="">his letter</span> 
<br/>indicates considerable mental activity. We thank 
<br/>you for the perusal. Many of his thoughts 
<br/>would vanish as many of ours have as soon 
<br/>as he breathed this pure atmosphere. the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>lack of the material for mechanical operations 
<br/>he does not know. But nothing is like the 
<br/>preaching of the word. Dogged perserverance 
<br/>at this is infinitely prefer<span class="add  above">r</span>able to doctoring 
<br/>tinkering or anything else. You have but a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>small quantity of iron in the <span class=""><span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>district</span>, none at all I imagine in <span class="">Griqua<br/>land</span>. Copper has been worked very 
<br/>extensively at <span class="">Chonuane</span>, enormous <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">amounts</span>
<br/>the labours of extraction have been. There 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>is abundance of iron ore here but would

<br/>If he came out as an artizan I for one should 
<br/>bitterly regret it and then who is to support him 
<br/>in his <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: journeys">journies</span>? and his <span class="underline ">wife</span> too! But it is unfair 
<br/>to criticise. they are the dreams - amiable speculations 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of one who seems quite on the right side Let us 
<br/>pray that he may be guided into the right path for

<br/>In regard to the head chest at <span class="">Philipolis</span> you have said
