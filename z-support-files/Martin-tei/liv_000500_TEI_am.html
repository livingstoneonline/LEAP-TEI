<br/><p class="p left">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 9 chars ">                  </span>There is one measure connected with missionary operations 
<br/>viz. the employment of <span class="">native</span> agency in the work of evangelizing the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">heathen</span>, to which although in <span class="">my last communication</span> I did not 
<br/>very pointedly advert. I have been most anxious to call the 
<br/>attention of the <span class="">Directors</span>.<span class="space" title="space: 7 chars ">              </span> Formerly when viewing the 
<br/><span class="">Heathen</span> would at a distance the measure appeared one of 
<br/>great importance and I resolved to give it earliest 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>attention. But now when I have come into close contact 
<br/>with it, and beheld a little of that vast extent of surface 
<br/>over which the population is scattered in the regions before me 
<br/>I powerfully feel its special, nay, overwhelming importance. 
<br/>Having lately in company with <span class="">Rev<span class="sup ">d</span> R. Edwards</span> of this mission 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>performed a journey (in going &amp; returning) of about 700 miles in 
<br/>length, the tract of country we saw seemed to me of immense 
<br/>extent, but when I look to the map it is a mere iota compared 
<br/>to what is yet to be possessed by the missionaries of the cross. 
<br/>But although the territory is larger than can be imagined by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>any one who has not seen a little of it, and though the 
<br/>tribes are situated at very formidable distances from each 
<br/>other, I see no cause for discouragement. And if at any 
<br/>time the prospects of success assume any other than a 
<br/>bright and cheering aspect it is when I have out of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>view the machinery of <span class="">native</span> agency put into vigorous 
<br/>operation -- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">In stating to the <span class="">Directors</span> my conviction that in this 
<br/>country this means of evangelization is specially indicated 
<br/>I need scarcely advert to the great efficiency of this class 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of laborers. Of their warm affectionate manner of dealing 
<br/>with their fellow countrymen - Of their capability to bring 
<br/>the truth itself before the mind entirely divested of that 
<br/>peculiar strangeness which cleaves to foreigners - And of the 
<br/>very eminent <span class="add  above">success</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> of those employed by the bretheren of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="">Griqua Town</span> I am persuaded they are already well 
<br/>aware - Their success is most encouraging, and no less 
<br/>so are the results which have followed the comparatively recent 
<br/>employment of two by this mission. Indeed I have no 
<br/>hesitation in affirming that during the short period <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">of</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>since they have been employed, these two have been as</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">efficient in propagating both a knowledge &amp; love of Christianity as 
<br/>could have been anticipated by even the warmest admirers 
<br/>of <span class="">native</span> agents.<span class="space" title="space: 5 chars ">          </span> In their hands the work still goes on 
<br/>well, and every now &amp; then our hearts are cheered by goodly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>accessions to the church of such as we hope that they are 
<br/>the "saved in <span class="">Christ Jesus</span>"- And if the measure is allowed free 
<br/>operation, if we are allowed by the <span class="">Directors</span> to employ a few 
<br/>more who in the judgement of the bretheren are fit for the work, 
<br/>we may anticipate conversions by the Divine blessing to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>increase in a compound ratio, &amp; regions not yet explored 
<br/>by <span class="">Europeans</span> will soon be supplied with the bread of life</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I do most earnestly beg the sanctions of the <span class="">Direction</span> for 
<br/>the employment of a few who are both able &amp; willing to devote 
<br/>their attention to this work. And in this request I have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the full concurrence of these bretheren on whose long 
<br/>experience greater confidence can be placed. I may 
<br/>also state <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">that</span> as a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: guarantee">garauntee</span> for the purity of the 
<br/>motives of those who are willing to devote themselves that £10
<br/>is by no means sufficient to support a <span class="">native</span> of this country 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>It is consequently at a sacrifice they engage in the work of 
<br/>the Lord -- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">With respect to the points at which operations could at 
<br/>present be most advantageously put in operation both the 
<br/><span class="">candidates</span> and missionaries who know the country have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>but one opinion, and that is, that the tribes 250 miles 
<br/>northward <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">than</span> are in a much more favourable state 
<br/>for our object than those in the surrounding localities 
<br/>The adjoining tribes amongst which no regular systematic 
<br/>operations have been carried on, are decidedly hostile to the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="">gospel</span>. They treat missionaries with respect, but at the 
<br/>same time manifest very great opposition to the <span class="">doctrines</span> we 
<br/>teach. And with scarcely one of them would a <span class="">native</span> teacher 
<br/>be allowed to live - I state this with diffidence because 
<br/>it is at direct variance with the opinions expressed in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="">my written instructions</span> yet at the same time I indulge the 
<br/>hope that when I state that the very opposite of a great 
<br/>desire for religious instruction prevails, my change of 
<br/>sentiment will not be ascribed to insufficient consider<br/>-ation, for conviction has been forced upon me by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>proofs of which, had it been possible, both my prejudices</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p ">and <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">inclination</span> expectations should have induced me gladly to have 
<br/>revisited the pressure -- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The tribes within 100 miles North &amp; North East of this are all parti- 
<br/>-ally acquainted with the requirements of the <span class="">gospel</span> but manifest 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the greatest hatred to them, and this is just what our knowledge 
<br/>of the human heart would lead us to expect. The same depravity 
<br/>exists <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: everyhere">every where</span> and this although to <span class="">christians</span> it may seem 
<br/>but the bare <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">enuntiation</span> of a self evident truth, ought to stand 
<br/>out prominently alongside the expectations of every young 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>missionary.<span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span> Those tribes however which be at a greater 
<br/>distance say 250 &amp; 300 miles Northward are in quite a diff-
<br/>-erent condition. They know nothing of the <span class="">gospel</span> &amp; consequently 
<br/>form neither a good nor bad opinion of it. They know nothing 
<br/>more of missionaries than that they are a <span class="">friendly race of whites</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>who love all men. And in many respects we occupy the same 
<br/>position with respect to them as some of our missionaries 
<br/>have with the <span class=""><span class="">South Sea</span> Islanders</span>.<span class="space" title="space: 4 chars ">        </span>There exists a strong 
<br/>impression in favour of <span class="">Europeans</span>. Strongest among 
<br/>those not previously visited by missionaries, traders &amp;c. but only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>in a minor degree in the tribes nearer;<span class="space" title="space: 5 chars ">          </span> To account for 
<br/>this phenomenon, it is only neccessary to remember the te<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: tear">[    ]</span>
<br/>scourging to which nearly all the <span class="">Interior</span> tribes have been <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: tear">[    ]</span>
<br/>in recent years subjected. They have experienced the crueltie<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: tear">[ ]</span>
<br/>of the, to the Bechuana, invincible marauders who <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: overran">overan</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the whole country and they have all heard of their successive 
<br/>repulses by mere handful of <span class="">whites</span>, and now the most 
<br/>distant are most anxious to secure the friendship of <span class="">Europeans</span> 
<br/>The last marauder the notorious <span class="">Mosilekatse</span> although obliged 
<br/>by the <span class="">Boors</span> to retire to the <span class="">Eastern extremity</span> of a lake in the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="">Interior</span> has recently recommenced plundering and the whole 
<br/>country is in a state of alarm. Those who dread him 
<br/>most have the greatest anxiety to obtain alliance with 
<br/><span class="">Europeans</span> and this feeling will induce them to receive 
<br/>either missionaries or teachers gladly; Now if we can 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>while this impression lasts confer on them a decided benefit 
<br/>we may hope it will continue. But if we allow this 
<br/>opportunity to pass unimproved it appears to me the time is 
<br/>not far distant when the <span class="">Interior</span> tribes will be in the same 
<br/>state of indifference &amp; opposition to those nearer. Injurious 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>influences are now in operation to effect this. The <span class="">Boors</span>
<br/>of <span class="">Port Matal</span> have advanced right into the <span class="">centre of the continent</span> 
<br/>&amp; seized most of the country &amp; the best of the fountains toward</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/><p class="p ">the <span class="">North East</span>. These on the one hand, and from this direction, traders <span class="">Griqua</span>
<br/>hunters &amp; individuals from the tribes which hate the <span class="">gospel</span> are every year passing 
<br/>in with more freedom and in many instances they prove curses 
<br/>instead of blessings (a <span class="">Griqua</span> has during this present year to my knowledge 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>communicated the venereal disease to three tribes amongst whom it was 
<br/>unknown before. One of these has been visited by missionaries but the 
<br/>other two have received one of the worst accompaniments of civilization 
<br/>before the missionaries came to give any of its blessings. This <span class="">Griqua</span>
<br/>does not belong to any mission station).</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">May I beg an early intimation empowering us to make an effort 
<br/>immediately in behalf of the post ignorant <span class="">heathen</span> in the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>if it is accordance with the intentions of the <span class="">Directors</span> to form a new 
<br/>mission in the <span class="">Interior</span>. I beg leave to call their attention to 
<br/>a tribe called the Bakhatla the location of which is the best I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>have seen in the <span class="">Interior</span>. A large valley with a fountain about 
<br/>equal to this at <span class="">Kuruman</span> &amp; much more land which by reason of 
<br/>the great <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: blotting">[  ]</span>ight of the point from which the water comes out, could 
<br/>be irrigated without any expense. Abundance of pasture for 
<br/>cattle with several other fountains at no great distance and a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>manufacture of iron from ore found in abundance in the 
<br/>adjoining mountains constitute the local attachments. Being a 
<br/>valley however it may be exposed to viscissitudes of temperature, unfav<br/>-ourable to health, but it does not contain anything like the amount 
<br/>of decaying vegetable <span class=""><span class="">K.</span> valley</span> does &amp; yet this is a healthy spot. I shall 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>in my next furnish fuller information on this topic</p>
