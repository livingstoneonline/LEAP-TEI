<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p noindent">My dear friend</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am now <span class="">two letters</span> in debt to you. One I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> on 
<br/>the <span class="">22<span class="sup ">d</span> Feb.</span> last when I was on the way towards the <span class="">Interior</span> the other 
<br/>I found a few days ago on my return &amp; now while I thank you 
<br/>heartily for them both I shall try to pay off the debt. This is for 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Pyne</span> the other I shall address to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Pyne</span> and though I think of 
<br/>you as "joined together" I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> be in the least offended though 
<br/>you each take separate sheets when you think of me. Every<br/>thing you mention is interesting so you must not think <span class="">your 
<br/>letter</span> valueless. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> advert to the topics contained in yours 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>because I think you will be more pleased with things relating 
<br/>to this country. In <span class="">this letter</span> however I shall deviate from my 
<br/>usual customs. I beg however to say that though I do not 
<br/>recur to the topic mentioned in yours on paper I often 
<br/>recur to them in spirit. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> feel overcomplacent
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>towards <span class="">Tho<span class="sup ">s</span> Prentice</span> he got <span class="">Miss Ridley</span> simply because he 
<br/>was intending to be a missionary. This was the stepping stone 
<br/>by which he gained her affections, now he sticks up at home 
<br/>in a miserable climate, &amp; I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> expect he will enjoy much 
<br/>happiness apart from sickness.  I am truly sorry to hear 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of the sickness of <span class="">Salome Cecil</span> &amp; intend writing her parents by 
<br/>this same opportunity. I earnestly hope the means used have 
<br/>proved effectual. I have had <span class="">a letter from <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Drummond</span></span>
<br/>He writes me he says first as he had <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> <span class="">my letter</span> before 
<br/>those of any others. He had <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> yours &amp; expected the small 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>boxes soon.  He has gone to <span class="">Savaii</span>. Navigators.  But I am 
<br/>pretty certain you have also <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> <span class="">a letter or letters from him</span> 
<br/>&amp; will not on that account say more about him. O I beg 
<br/>his pardon I must tell you the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: world's">worlds</span> population has been 
<br/>augmented by a unit in the person of <span class="">Jean D.</span> the daughter of <span class="">Rev 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>G.D.</span> of <span class="village ">Savaii</span> He says "a prettier sweeter little creature was never 
<br/>seen by me nor any other old <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: bachelor">batchelor</span> like me" This of course 
<br/>I feel much obliged by your kindness in sending me the box you 
<br/>mention. It has not yet arrived but I expect it shall by <span class="">Mr 
<br/>Nighs</span> whom we expect next month. I cannot say that I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>have all things I need but I most certainly prefer to be as<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: hole">[ ]</span>
<br/>getting a little assistance now &amp; then from kind friends like 
<br/>yourself &amp; feeling both a light purse &amp; light heart to being encum<br/>bered with such a load as good <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> brings with him 
<br/>You tell me a secret I shall tell you one in return He has 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>no less than 50 tons of goods &amp; luggage with him. We poor 
<br/>ignorant things here hold up our hands in amazement &amp; say 
<br/>better he have them than we. I feel much obliged to you 
<br/>for your suggestion respecting the watch but I feel quite out 
<br/>of <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: humour">humour</span> with <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: it &amp;">&amp; it</span> its maker. It is only valuable to me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>now as proof of your disinterested kindness. I feel disinclined 
<br/>to have anything more to do with <span class="">Yonge</span>. Perhaps sometime when 
<br/>I become rich I shall buy another. At present I am content with 
<br/>the sun as my guide. However if I see a good opportunity

       

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>yet avail myself of your willingess to serve me. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Williams</span> of 
<br/><span class="village ">Hankey</span> is at present in <span class="">England</span>. He has taken that step in 
<br/>consequence of a disease in throat. He wished much to come up 
<br/>here &amp; go with me to the <span class="">Interior</span> but after all was prepared 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>at <span class="">Algoa Bay</span> a doctor there declared that the season was too 
<br/>far advanced &amp; the attempt might cost him his life. What nonsense 
<br/>There is not a finer climate in the world. I hope going home 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> cost him his life. He was an excellent man. I have requested 
<br/>him to call upon you. I wish he may I only saw him for a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>short time but I love him as much as if he had been the comp<br/>anion of my boyhood. If he should come &amp; spend a day with 
<br/>you, you would be delighted with him. He is a real good warm
<br/>hearted welshman. I hope he will find it convenient. I intend to 
<br/>send a few things to you immediately they are so few I am 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>ashamed to send them alone, &amp; as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> W.</span> desires me to purchase 
<br/>for him a few karosses I shall send yours in the same box 
<br/>But you mush not think this is the box I promised you 
<br/>I send these as a rememberance &amp; pledge of a greater expression of my 
<br/>regard at some future time. I would have sent you a greater number 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of karosses but I am informed that the duty on them is very great 
<br/>&amp; I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> like to put the professor to over much expense. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>Williams</span> desires me to send him karosses as a mode of 
<br/>transmitting money for some articles which I must be in want of &amp; 
<br/>which he is anxious to serve me by purchasing for me. I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>shall write you again when I send off the box &amp; specify all 
<br/>the articles it contains for you. They will be put into two 
<br/>separate parcels so that <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> W.</span> will perfectly understand 
<br/>what is intended for you. The camel thorn I shall procure without 
<br/>difficulty. The wood is what we <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">burn</span><span class="add  above">use</span> as fuel &amp; it is as you will 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>see by the specimen very hard. Insects I have not been able 
<br/>to preserve with the exception of a few locusts But in <span class="">my next</span> 
<br/>I shall mention them all. <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>O I forgot to give you all the secret 
<br/>about the 50 tons Perhaps there not 20 worth the freight for 
<br/>can you believe it there are some <span class="">donors</span> who give what
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> make the least use of themselves. They must  
<br/>be <span class="">old maids</span> surely. Only think of lots of old dirty ball dresses 
<br/>which the Bechuanas <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> look at as they can be seen 
<br/>through. Hundreds of old oblong silk buttons <span class="figure">{figure}</span> which I remember to 
<br/>have seen on ladies dresses when I was a little boy. The old worn
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>out coverings of parasols. Old starched shirt collars to people 
<br/>who have no shirts. Together with nameless other old rubbish 
<br/>of which the Bechuanas can make no earthly use. Really some 
<br/>of the good people in <span class="">England</span> seem to have consciences of 
<br/><span class="">India</span> Rubber. Somethings  more for his transmission 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>than would suffice to purchase new ones at <span class="">Colesberg</span>. The 
<br/>shirts with holes in them <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: too">to</span> bad I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> even make good 
<br/>bandages to bind up sores with them. It is not want of 
<br/>knowledge which makes them send such things. For you know 
<br/>as little of what was proper as they do when you kindly gave 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>me your first box &amp; yet every article you gave was valuable 
<br/>There was not a useless thing in it. And although I joked 
<br/>you about the babies clothes it was because I did not then

<br/>know that they could be useful in the hands of a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: bachelor">batchelor</span>, they 
<br/>have however been very useful in the hands of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> W. Phillip</span> now of 
<br/><span class="">Hankey</span>. I would not now give all to her as I did then. All these things 
<br/>are useful for the purpose of gaining the affections &amp; thereby leading the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">natives</span> to the Saviour. Your remarks about having one to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">warm</span>
<br/>to till that solitude is sweet I can fully understand, I have however 
<br/>usually a good stock of spirits (not artificial) &amp; can bear up against 
<br/>loneliness. But it sometimes requires all my philosophy especially when 
<br/>away for months together from all <span class=""><span class="">European</span> Society</span>. The friends at <span class="">Griqua<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>town</span> imagined that I must be dying for want of a wife &amp; kindly sent  
<br/>their daughter all the way to <span class="">Kuruman</span> by way of experiment. When 
<br/>that failed great anxiety was manifested to know who were my 
<br/>female correspondents in <span class="">England</span>. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Ross</span> told them that I was 
<br/>in love with a young widow in <span class="">London</span> called <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Sewell</span>! <span class="">My 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>letters to her</span> have all failed in reaching their destinations ever since 
<br/>She is now becoming angry with me for not writing <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: fading">[  ]</span> this 
<br/>account I beg leave to enclose one to her in yours. She has 
<br/>always been most kind to me &amp; even now writes me regularly 
<br/>sends <span class="">my publications</span> &amp;c although she never hears whether
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span> anything she sends unless she hears it from you 
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know who destroys <span class="">my letters to her</span> but the above 
<br/>circumstances make me suspicious of certain <span class="">parties</span> connected 
<br/>with the <span class=""><span class="">Mission</span> families at <span class="">Griqua Town</span></span>. None of the 
<br/>bretheren here feel in any way satisfied with either <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> or M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Ross</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>They have most unhappy dispositions &amp; often grieve us all. You saw 
<br/>his letter in the <span class="">Chronicle</span>. It gives such a false view <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> R.</span> felt 
<br/>ashamed of it &amp; said <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> R.</span> had not written the <span class="">Directors</span> so, the conver

<br/>to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> alone. The first day I was in the church I obse<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: hole">[    ]</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="">Baba</span> weeping under <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Mr EEdwards's"><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>s</span> preaching. We were all astounded 
<br/>at the change which we were told had taken place in him.  
<br/>But when <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>told of his <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">former</span> disparate wickedness <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> R.</span> insisted that 
<br/><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">that</span> his deeds such as offering to shoot his father were merely 
<br/>boyish tricks. You would imagine that he could preach when 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>he wrote that letter. He cannot even now give an address 
<br/>without reading it &amp; after all that is very little understood 
<br/>by the <span class="">natives</span>. In common conversation he interlaids it with 
<br/>English. The <span class="">natives</span> have first to guess at what he means 
<br/>I often feel dissatisfied with myself and think there are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>many far better for this great work who have not been 
<br/>permitted to enter upon<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: hole">[      ]</span> it But when I see <span class="">Ross</span>'s <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 3 chars, cause: hole">[   ]</span>seuse
<br/>I am constrained to think there are some worse <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: hole">[      ]</span>. It
<br/>was a great oversight in <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> to recommend such a 
<br/>man. <span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> &amp; I &amp; perhaps <span class="">Nighs</span> will go in the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>course of a few months to commence a <span class="">mission</span> among 
<br/>the Bakhatla. I gave you some account of them on a former 
<br/>occasion. <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: ">[      ]</span></span> it is the <span class="">Sheffield</span> of the <span class="">Interior</span>. And 
<br/>very near the spot where <span class="">J. Campbell</span> faced about to 
<br/>go home. He heard of oven <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: foundries">founderies</span> but was 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>not permitted to see them. These are still in existence 
<br/>&amp; belong to the Bakhatla, the reason why they did not 
<br/>allow him to look at them was they were afraid his 
<br/>presence should bewitch the oven. A mishap which 

       

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>always takes place when they blow too hard &amp; burn it. They 
<br/>then take out the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">cinder</span> &amp; look upon it in consternation.  
<br/>It is clearly bewitched. The evidence is so positive no one can 
<br/>doubt it. It is also near to the spot where <span class="">Sebegoe</span> with the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">remains of his tribe</span> have taken up their abode. I smiled when 
<br/>you said you almost trembled to think of my going as far <span class="">North</span> 
<br/>&amp; into the same dangers as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span>. I should have trembled 
<br/>too had I been at home &amp; thought of it. But the sense of danger 
<br/>vanishes when you are in a country of lions. I have been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>as far if not farther on the other side of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M</span>'s <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">ultimate</span> <span class="add  above">farthest</span>
<br/>point <span class="">North</span> as that is on the other side of <span class="">Kuruman</span> and 
<br/>in a country too where the lions are so plentiful they are 
<br/><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: fading">[      ]</span> &amp; roar even at midday. The place where <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M.</span> saw 
<br/><span class="">Mosilikatze</span> is about 10 miles on this side of the Bakhatla
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>He has been driven away North by the <span class=""><span class="">boors</span></span> but is still living 
<br/>and destroying the neighbouring tribes as formerly. I walked 
<br/>over the site of his town when I was returning. The 
<br/>whole country was bare the grass having been burned 
<br/>off so I had a good view of the whole &amp; a few 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>human bones scattered about were the only relics 
<br/>I could discover of all the greatness of the tyrant 
<br/>When I was lately at the <span class="">Makalaka</span> I saw some of his 
<br/><span class="">people</span> &amp; sent a message to him. One took off an armlet
<br/>and gave it me as a token to my nation that I had seen him 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>&amp; requested I should give him a pair of earrings to be a 
<br/>token to <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> that he had seen me. I gave him two
