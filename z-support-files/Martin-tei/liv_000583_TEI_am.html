<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">Mabotsa </span> <span class="">12 May 1845</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> <span class="">your very welcome letter</span> by
<br/>the Bakhatla who went out with <span class="">Mosi</span> &amp; felt very thankful
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for it for we were very anxious to hear what you
<br/>thought after perusing <span class="">my long epistle</span> on the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: disagreeable">disagreable</span>
<br/>subject. We hope to have an opportunity soon
<br/>so I begin to answer what is answerable &amp; let you
<br/>know how we get on. Your question about the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Boerish</span> peace makers is easily settled. The <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>is not yet pacified. <span class="">Bube</span> intends it is currently
<br/>reported, to remove to a spot not very distant from
<br/>this. He sent me word that he intends coming
<br/>for the purpose <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">of</span> asking land next week, &amp; the reason
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>is, he fears the Matibele will come out during this
<br/>winter. <span class="">Sekhomi</span> has stolen some sheep from
<br/><span class="">Mosilikatse</span> this year &amp; he killed 23 of <span class="">his people</span>
<br/>last year when they came to ask tribute. All
<br/>are now dreading <span class="">Mosilikatse</span>'s resentment. <span class="">Sechele</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>told me he would remove instantly to a <span class="">fountain
<br/>called Kolobeñ</span> in hopes of getting a missionary
<br/>if it were not for that same fear - And
<br/><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">last</span> two years ago when the Matibele attacked in
<br/>succession the Bamangwato, Bakwain &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>Wanketaze of <span class="">Sebegoe</span>. the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> heard the news
<br/><span class="underline ">and fled</span>. They would do so again this year
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> went with large presents of ivory
<br/>to <span class="">Hendrick Potkeiter</span> the commandant of the
<br/><span class="">Boers</span> to entreat their assistance for the recovery
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of his cattle. Instead of <span class="underline ">pacifying</span> the poor
<br/>fellow as he wished they told <span class="">Mr Bain</span> that the
<br/><span class="">Caffres</span> had come with tribute to them. Catch
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> going back again with his ivory
<br/>while <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hume</span> lives. Not a single fray
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>has been prevented by the <span class="">Boers</span> &amp; the notion</p>

	
<br/><p class="ab "><span class="">Mary</span> has been ill but a small bleeding has relieved the most troublesome symptoms &amp; she now does
<br/>well. My arm is very much stronger but the splint is still in the same state</p>


	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">that they drove away <span class="">Mosilikatse</span> I believe now to be
<br/>very questionable. the Goolahs were the cause
<br/>of his flight &amp; not the paltry attack of <span class="">Mosega</span>
<br/>Ask the <span class="">people of <span class="">Sechele</span></span> how they like the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Boers</span> &amp; they will tell you that rather than come
<br/>near them again they will desert their chief</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I began a meeting for the purpose of trying
<br/>to interest the people in our meetings in general
<br/>&amp; have continued talking on different subjects
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>calculated to engage their attention But have not
<br/>met the success I expected. <span class="">Our own people</span>
<br/>are the chief attendants and they seem to enjoy
<br/>what is told them. The hearts of the Bakhatla
<br/>must <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, hand: #U; type: strikethrough; ">be changed before anything can be made
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of them, that is the first thing I see, and I
<br/>shall attend to it as the everything. My mind
<br/>has been taken up with the affair of <span class="">Edwards</span>
<br/>to an extent far exceeding my wishes. I think
<br/>of it when I ought to be meditating on better
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>things But I hope I may not indulge in
<br/>any improper spirit towards him. I have
<br/>felt less anxious than I expected I should be
<br/>when told I should have a <span class="">committee</span> held over me
<br/>By the way, I may ask, if he will be allowed to
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>speak or contradict without my presence, I
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> as I speak by writing he ought although
<br/>there to do the same &amp; then let the bretheren judge
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know what he will say after, he could
<br/>speak about my shabby treatment when he
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>offered <span class="underline ">to build the house</span>, &amp; no such offer was
<br/>ever made</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, hand: #U; type: strikethrough; ">Another affair I wish to mention to you as I
<br/>feel rather at a loss how to act in it, if I</span> were not
<br/>already involved with <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> I should see my path clear


	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>But as it is I fear I may act more from an improper
<br/>spirit than f<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: blotting">[  ]</span>m a wish to prevent the degradation of the
<br/>missionary character. Some time last year <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> told
<br/>me that having been at <span class="">Bube</span>'s a brother of the latter offered
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>him a large tusk for a musket he had with him, But he (<span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>)
<br/>had declined, the same man came here a short time before
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> left for <span class="">Kuruman</span> &amp; came to me &amp; asked if I should
<br/>give him a cow for a large tusk. I replied, no, I am not a
<br/>trader. He said yes I know you are not a trader but <span class="">Edwards</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>helped me with a gun &amp; I helped him with a tusk. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span>
<br/>was that day down on a visit to the Bahurutse &amp; having come
<br/>home in the evening the man left on the day following and
<br/>I neither asked nor heard any more about it untill the
<br/>return of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Milligan</span> from <span class=""><span class="">Bube</span>'s</span>. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>'s man went
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>with <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M.</span> to <span class=""><span class="">Bube</span>'s</span> to purchase Karosses, for <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> (I suppose
<br/>for carpets) and <span class="">Mr M</span> said to me, "O <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> has turned
<br/>trader now". "His man brought a fine large tusk <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above"><span class="underline ">this is N<span class="sup ">o</span> 2</span></span> from the
<br/>Bakwains for him". If it were not for our difference
<br/>I should ask an explanation from <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> and caution
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>him against appearing to degrade the missionary character.
<br/>He has been purchasing oxen ever since we came here
<br/>but he always mentioned his journey to the <span class="">Colony</span> as 
<br/>the reason, and of course that journey does require many.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I shall not feel surprised although I hear that
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> has made overtures to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ashton</span> to supplant me
<br/>here. Many things have recently come back to my
<br/>recollection which had entirely escaped me, and why
<br/>they should have vanished from my mind I cannot
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span>. But now when I put them together I see
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the reason of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> running to a <span class="">committee</span>, He
<br/>wishes to have me out of this altogether &amp; he thinks
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ashton</span> a more likely subject for him to twist
<br/>round his finger. When <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">I returned from</span> <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Moffat</span>
<br/>wrote from <span class="">Bethelsdorp</span> she o<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">m</span>mitted mentioning anything
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>about the young bretheren. When I returned, to the
<br/>house this was the first piece of news I got, and
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E.</span> having conjectured that there must be some
<br/>difference among them. "A very good thing indeed
<br/>remarked <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> if there is <span class="">Moffat</span> will not have it all
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span><span class="space" title="space: 8 words ">                                                                </span>his own way"

       

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>and again on a subsequent occasion, I think after your
<br/>arrival but I am not sure. Perhaps after my return from
<br/>meeting you "I think <span class="">Ashton</span> is a man of <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independent">independant</span> mind &amp;
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> be led by the nose by <span class="">Moffat</span>" and then when
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I returned from seeing <span class="">Mary</span>, I was asked if I should not
<br/>like to live with my father in law. I thought the question
<br/>very impudent &amp; simply said "No" &amp; then among a
<br/>number of fishing pumping questions put to <span class="">Mary</span>
<br/>such as "You &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Ashton</span> must be very intimate, &amp; if
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Ashton</span> was to remain at the <span class="">Kuruman</span>, these things had
<br/>all vanished from my mind, But in thinking over the
<br/>other affair a connecting link I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> from one
<br/>of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>'s intimate friends. came back with great
<br/>vividness, "I advise you said he to be as little <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: dependent">dependant</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>on <span class="">Kuruman</span> as possible, we have all been too much so"
<br/>Now I may be wrong but my close connection with    
<br/><span class="">Kuruman</span> seems to have had some influence
<br/>as well as my "dishonest dishonourable unchristian
<br/>&amp; shabby conduct".</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p ">The plough is in process of resuscitation and though
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> consigned it to "old iron" I feel sanguine it
<br/>will soon be of more use than that material. Not
<br/>having the instruments for boring or drilling holes for
<br/>rivets I have taken the essential portions &amp; let them
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>into a log of murutu of this shape  the
<br/>different portions are firmly screwed to it &amp; tomorrow
<br/>we shall put in a new beam of white ash much
<br/>thicker than the old but with the old wheel &amp; coulter
<br/>irons. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Milligan</span> gave me an idea of the shape
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>or I should have gone wrong, altogether. I had the
<br/>handles in when he came &amp; as I was doing it simply
<br/>from my recollection of the shape of a plough I have
<br/>the centre of the handles right in the centre of the
<br/>plough &amp; not chiefly on the furrow side as it ought
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>to be. Will you send the iron which runs from
<br/>the handles to the beam, which you shewed me in
<br/>the printing office. the one you made is entirely
<br/>gone.</p>


	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><p class="p ">We have been favoured with <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Greig</span>'s presence more
<br/>than <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: agreeable">agreable</span>. We escaped from him only once &amp; that
<br/>was by getting all ready &amp; starting for <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s</span> as soon
<br/>as he made his appearance from the other side. He was
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>nearly quits with us for he said he would come to meet us
<br/>We went round by another way But our gent. very soon
<br/>came back to see if we had not arrived. I thought of
<br/>going off to <span class="">Bube</span> but he is determined to accompany us
<br/>So I give up that &amp; now think of going Eastward to
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the son of <span class="">Sebegoe</span>. I could easily be plain with him
<br/>&amp; get quit of his very insipid company but for one
<br/>consideration Before we had been many days here
<br/>he made some remarks which made me believe <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>
<br/>had been reciting to him the burden of his song, for
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>instance, "<span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> is a man of a very peculiar
<br/>temper" "very difficult to get on with I should think"
<br/>"He tells me he did the most of the work of the church
<br/>at <span class="">Kuruman</span>" "at least all the woodwork" To these
<br/>remarks I only replied that as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hamilton</span> &amp; <span class="">Moffat</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>were there it is not very likely they would be idle
<br/>&amp; avoided saying a word about <span class="">Edwards</span>. But believing
<br/>that <span class="">Edwards</span> had given as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> E.</span> would say "the
<br/>other side of my character" I rather submit to be
<br/>half eaten up by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> G.</span> than that he should have
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>any thing to say against us. If we could by any
<br/>possibility get a secondhand mill untill our own comes
<br/>we should get on well whoever comes <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> us
<br/>We have maize &amp; the large box which contained the
<br/>drawers nearly full of wheat. We are inundated with
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>pumpkins. I got two sheep for gun mending, thanks
<br/>to you, and two karrosses (debt) which I shall send
<br/>as soon as I get as payment for the steel. The people
<br/>believe that having married your daughter I must know
<br/>as much about the business as yourself. the goodness
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of the steel confirms their opinion When putting
<br/>on a plate for <span class="">Sechele</span> last week I soldered it very
<br/>well with powdered glass instead of the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">borax</span> you use
<br/>But on hardening again the libi were not warm
<br/>enough so I took it to the bellows &amp; the copper
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>came all out again. I tried it again with

       

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>other copper no fewer than four times &amp; it always
<br/>ran any where but where I wanted it. In despair
<br/>I put in some white lead. What must I do if
<br/>I make the same mistake again? the old files
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>you gave me I case hardened &amp; find they supply the
<br/>place of the fine large coarse teethed one you gave
<br/>&amp; which I got spoiled by lending to <span class="">Paulus</span>. If you
<br/>have any others from <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hamilton</span>'s burned house
<br/>which you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> care about I shall feel thankful
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>for one or two either to harden or make taps
<br/>of. My small plate has been spoiled by some<br/>one. the thread is nearly gone, I have made taps
<br/>of those holes which will make them and
<br/>will take the liberty of sending out two of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>smaller ones for the screw from your plate
<br/>and then I shall try &amp; finish a plate which
<br/>I have already forge<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">d</span>. The small screws I
<br/>need are those inside a lock, particularly that
<br/>which goes through the pan. I have got the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>chief &amp; a few of his principal men to try
<br/>their hands at the anvil and this although
<br/>they believed they should die if they did. One of
<br/>the hereditary smiths came and taught us
<br/>how to make <span class="">native</span> axes. I did not know
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to fold in &amp; weld a thin bit before I saw him
<br/>do it. I took one of the antient smiths
<br/>with us to <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s</span> to shew me where his forefather
<br/>found the tsipi &amp; men. there are many mines
<br/>and the smoke of the fires is still adhering to the
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>roofs but they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> go in far. the veins reach
<br/>the surface &amp; are about <span class="">2 inches in diameter</span> only
<br/>The man asserted while in the first recess <span class="add  below">or</span> <span class="add  above">mine</span> that the
<br/>rock above contained the ore. It is nearly identical
<br/>with the <span class="">Kuruman</span> <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Trap</span>. I doubted but as he
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>repeated his assertions with great confidence
<br/>I thought perhaps it was the ore of tin. As
<br/>I have nearly forgotten its appearance But when

       

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>we came out I noticed a piece of the pretty green
<br/>copper ore in a vein of about <span class="">½ an inch diameter</span>
<br/>&amp; pointed it out to him He said yes it is so after it is
<br/>subjected to the fire. These were copper mines
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>The tin I believe is found nearer to this place but in
<br/>the same direction <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Evans</span> found a piece of the ore
<br/>much richer than any I have seen although I have
<br/>been on the look out for it every time I have been
<br/>in that country. The hill where I think it must
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>lie in is called <span class="">Tsipcane</span> or as <span class="unclear">Batlapi</span> would say
<br/><span class="">Tsicane</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">Sechele</span> you will have heard lately put a man
<br/>to death for witchcraft. We of course had a great
<br/>deal of conversation on the subject &amp; on that of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>revenge. Before the former subject was introduced
<br/>He asked me if an individual acted justly, fairly
<br/>avoided fighting treated <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">b</span>oth his own people and
<br/><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: hole">[ ]</span>trangers kindly, killed witches &amp; prayed to God
<br/>would he <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">be</span> saved - this question made me see
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>he thought he had committed a meritorious action
<br/>in killing the man. The above affair became
<br/>mixed up with another which you will perhaps
<br/><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: hole">[ ]</span>lso hear about. One of his people who formerly
<br/>killed an uncle of <span class="">Sechele</span> fled on hearing that
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the witch had been killed &amp; came here, being afraid
<br/>that he might be the next. When he arrived here
<br/>he told the people that <span class="">Sechele</span> wished to kill him on
<br/>account of his cattle &amp;c. The man's father brought
<br/>all his son's sheep &amp;c. to <span class="">Sechele</span> after the latter had
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>fled &amp; divided them among the principal people. <span class="">Sechele</span>
<br/>took one only &amp; eat it &amp; told the others not to slaughter
<br/>any of them untill he had tried to recover the man
<br/>the man was sent for &amp; returned and is now
<br/>alive &amp; well. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> believing the man's
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>testimony against <span class="">Sechele</span> sends him "a severe
<br/>reprimand" as he expressed it to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Greig</span> for a
<br/>deed which he did not do. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E.</span> does not
<br/>like <span class="">Sechele</span> because <span class="">Sechele</span> is rather friendly with me

       

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>when leaving in order to visit <span class="">Sechele</span> last time the chief
<br/>here said to me, "Yes you can go to visit <span class="">Sechele</span>, you
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know him <span class="">Edwards</span> knows him &amp; he says when
<br/>I took the Doctor to the <span class="">Bakwain country</span> I let him see what
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Sechele</span> was but he does not see now" If I liked I could
<br/>get plenty of evidence of "going to <span class="">natives</span>" for expressions
<br/>are let drop perpetually which convince me that the
<br/>rogue was suspicious because he knew his own deeds
<br/>I believe <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">he</span> thinks I have mentioned to you all the nonsense
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he talked about you &amp; everybody else at times, and that
