<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">8<span class="sup underline ">th</span> April 1842</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear <span class="">Manning</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 12 chars ">                        </span>I feel much pleasure in commencing an epistle to you but 
<br/>whether you will feel as much in perusing it is another question, The place 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>whence I now write you is the residence of <span class="">Bubi</span> one of the Bakwain chiefs 
<br/>The town is situated on the top of a hill which forms part of a pretty extensive 
<br/>range and from its height it feels much pleasanter than in the plains below 
<br/>Round the bottom and through a deep defile which separates this from another 
<br/>part of the range runs a river not very large but superior to the contem<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>-ptible thing that runs past <span class="">Ongar</span>. In this country such a stream is 
<br/>invaluable for irrigating the land. I came here for the purpose of 
<br/>assisting a <span class="">native</span> teacher to commence operations and likewise to 
<br/>perfect myself in the language by cutting myself off from all <span class="">European</span> 
<br/>conversation. A great deal of intercourse being necessary on account 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of the want  any <span class="">dictionary</span> except such as every one constructs 
<br/>for himself. After we commenced school for the children I wished 
<br/>to lead out some water to irrigate a garden for <span class="">Pomore</span>. (The teacher) 
<br/>And when I explained that this was my way of making rain and 
<br/>how far superior it was to their enchantments all were quite 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>delighted with the idea. The chief sent as many men as I needed &amp; 
<br/>we proceeded to operations in the best way we could.  We have raised 
<br/>a huge dam of earth &amp; stones and dug a canal which will water many 
<br/>gardens. And the whole of the labour has been performed by themselves 
<br/>for I was unable after the first day to stimulate them as I wished, on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>account of having got both legs &amp; arms severely sunburned. And 
<br/>that too although most of the time immersed in the water 
<br/>the digging was performed by sharpened sticks. When they came to a 
<br/>large stone too large to lift out they had just to dig round it so it is quite 
<br/>of a zig zag form. The earth was lifted out in handfuls &amp; carried to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the dam in their karosses, a wooden bowl or tortoise shell. After nearly 
<br/>completing it a tornado came down &amp; swept a great portion of our 
<br/>work away, but after looking a little with rueful countenances 
<br/>they commenced again with all their might. I have been the
<br/>more astonished at the industry of these wild ignorant <span class="">heathen</span>, as    
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the early missionaries could never get them to work. At <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>the missionaries have been obliged to perform most of the manual 
<br/>labour themselves. Working even for wages was almost out of 
<br/>prospect of a future <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">benefit</span><span class="add  above">benefit</span> held out before them. I have no 
<br/>doubt but you could have managed the business much better 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>I did not even think of it when I left home, (So I should imagine 
<br/>that many things of a like nature will occur to you and if 
<br/>you can gain their attention and affection you will do great 
<br/>good among them) I am quite ignorant of the scientific way 
<br/>of irrigation. It was almost all guess work &amp; with a trembling 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>heart I watched untill I saw the water assume its new course</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">You can by ingenuity lead the <span class="">people</span> but one can never force them. They 
<br/>are mere children and although they have the passions of men thay are as 
<br/>easily pleased as babies. Shew one a looking glass &amp; he will almost go 
<br/>into convulsions laughing at his own image. But if you are habitually kind 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to any one in particular you will spoil him &amp; get the envy of the rest. He 
<br/>immediately thinks he has a right to what he gets &amp; becomes impudent. To this 
<br/>the missionaries here never knew an exception. You require therefore 
<br/>to study their characters a little and then there is no difficulty in guiding them 
<br/>you must expect disappointments among them for they are an exceeding<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>-ly selfish <span class="">race</span> &amp; it by no means leaves them entirely when they become 
<br/><span class="">Christians</span>, to this however there are exceptions. The <span class="">people</span> here are 
<br/>more simple &amp; know less of vice or at least the vices of <span class="">Europeans</span> than 
<br/>those further to the <span class="">South</span>.  They <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> hate the <span class="">gospel</span> because they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>
<br/>know it. I think they are not so greedy either. Towards the <span class="">South</span> if 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>one follows you into the field he will ask payment for it May even 
<br/>the children after having enjoyed in play with the children of the missionary 
<br/>will sometimes come and demand payment for the same. Part of the 
<br/>reason of this may be the manner in which they treated the first mission<br/>-aries induced them to give to almost everyone who asked. They live in danger 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of their lives &amp; durst not say a sharp word to them. Here I have ventured 
<br/>on a different plan<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">t</span> I pay all baneful debt mere begging I discour<br/>-age by speaking out in pla<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: illegible">[  ]</span><span class="add  inline">˄</span><span class="add  above">terms</span> from the king downwards. They begin 
<br/>now to understand that I am not to be imposed on, the other day the 
<br/>king came &amp; begged something. I answered <span class="">Bubi</span> you know I hate beggars 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>He disappeared in an instant. Some <span class="">natives</span> from a tribe about 
<br/>100 miles south of this came on a visit while the dam was in progress 
<br/>&amp; told the <span class="">people</span> that they ought to demand payment for that 
<br/>work. Next day when they began to be tired they told me what the 
<br/>strangers had said, adding that the missionaries at <span class="">Kuruman</span> always 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">demanded</span><span class="add  above">gave</span> payment &amp; they did not mean to work without. I told 
<br/>them it was all kindness in one to shew them how to do such a 
<br/>work &amp; instead of my paying them they ought to pay me but as they 
<br/>were discontented we should drop it instantly. I left them immediately 
<br/>as it was only to try me they felt sorry they had proceeded so far 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>and came begging I should not cease to shew them how to work 
<br/>the king himself joining them saying I must not think of leaving 
<br/>them alone it was just their foolishness. Perhaps these little incidents 
<br/>will let you see what sort of <span class="">people</span> you will have to deal with.
<br/>It is not so much the present as the future we have to look to. We    
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>must stimulate them to industry. Giving without making them feel 
<br/>that they have earned what they receive has a very bad effect 
<br/>it makes them covetous &amp; does not tend to advance their civilization 
<br/>This is the effect of all these clothes sent out by kind friends in 
<br/><span class="">England</span>. If it were in the power of the missionary to dispose 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>of these articles for payment in labour they would be a benefit 
<br/>to the <span class="">people</span> But they are to be distributed &amp; the distribution  
<br/>however conducted is the cause of heart burnings without end 
<br/>amongst all both rich &amp; poor. Even <span class="">Mahura</span> the chief of the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Batlape</span>
<br/>grumbled because he did not get some of the clothes sent out for the</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">poor of <span class="">Kuruman</span></span>. When you come therefore much of plans whereby 
<br/>you will make them benefit themselves. A trader can do more for the 
<br/>mere civilization than a missionary. The missionaries deny this but it is 
<br/>to me quite apparent. The <span class="">natives</span> here never imitate the missionaries. (I <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">mean</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>at <span class="">Kuruman</span>) We have Christianized but the <span class="">natives</span> have preferred to 
<br/>imitate the <span class="">Griquas</span> who have a remnant of the customs of the Dutch  <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boor">boor</span></span>
<br/>There is only one square house in <span class="">K.</span> besides those of the missionaries &amp; 
<br/>traders &amp; that was built by a <span class="">Hottentot</span> &amp; is now uninhabited. All the 
<br/>Bechuanas live in their old beehive huts as they did in the beginning. At 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Moteeto</span> there is not one <span class="">native</span> house square. And only now they are 
<br/>beginning at <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Helman</span>'s to erect a few square houses. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know 
<br/>what is best to be done. I should think our chief hopes be in the infant 
<br/>schools <span class="space" title="space: 10 chars ">                    </span>Here I could build <span class="">Thomas</span> a house for a few lbs
<br/>of beads &amp; would certainly begin if I knew his intentions but I have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>not had a single line from him, If I were certain he would come 
<br/>I could place it in a sufficient state of forwardness for his recept- 
<br/>-ion soon after his arrival but I am quite in the dark. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> like 
<br/>to begin one although it would not be great trouble while mixing with 
<br/>people to learn the language But perhaps I am speaking <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: too">to</span>confid<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>-ently. I have not yet tried housebuilding though I succeeded pretty 
<br/>well in irrigation. You must take care &amp; never let your temper 
<br/>get soured on beholding the ingratitude of the <span class="">natives</span>. You will be tried 
<br/>but rather be a stoic than otherwise. You ought to have a plow &amp; above 
<br/>all a smiths apparatus if you can work a little in that way. But these 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>things are not so absolutely necessary as the first missionaries would 
<br/>had you to believe. They were indeed for them but I have been unable 
<br/>to see that they are so to us, A good stock of medicines. These have <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: blotting">[    ]</span>
<br/>exceedingly serviceable to me but <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> will say the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: smith">smiths</span> bellows 
<br/>above everything. For this part &amp; all before us beads are the only coin 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>so as many of these as you can bring. You may either purchase these 
<br/>in the <span class="">Colony</span> or in <span class="">England</span> I suppose they are cheaper at home than in 
<br/>the <span class="">Colony</span>. They are the only circulating medium, tin vessels, knives 
<br/>snuffboxes must do instead of money, money itself <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span>, small looking 
<br/>glasses, here &amp; nearer to <span class="">Kuruman</span> handkerchiefs. I did not like to give
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>beads at first &amp; so great was my prejudice against them I brought none 
<br/>to <span class="">K.</span> but I cannot now help thinking that they look much the better of a 
<br/>few round their dirty necks &amp; arms.<span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span>You need not fear the langua<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: cutoff">[  ]</span>
<br/>it is easy. I have found no difficulty with it &amp; I am no great genius at the
<br/>languages. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> represents it exceedingly difficult &amp; it was so to him 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>but it will never be so to any one else. The only difficulty in it is the jumb<br/>ling way of speaking it many of the <span class="">natives</span> have. With those who speak it 
<br/>well one finds no difficulty in understanding. It was indeed a great work in 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M</span> to reduce it to writing &amp; no one can understand it fully but himself 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hamilton</span> is always quoted by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M</span> as never having acquired the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>language but the reason is quite plain. He never once made an effort 
<br/>He has the Dutch will, is an easy soft sort of good man, uses an interpreter 
<br/>&amp; thus content with his crutch goes on in the old way. <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Don't">Dont</span> fear it</p>
