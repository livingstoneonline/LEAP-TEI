<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p center">As <span class="">Apie</span> leaves tomorrow I begin
<br/>another hurried scrawl. For the first time in my
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>life I feel that my hands are really full. Too
<br/>many irons in the fire over head &amp; ears and the
<br/>rain will come I have no doubt. I came here
<br/>last friday week &amp; after a fortnights sojourn
<br/>intend to leave on thursday or friday next, my
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>window frames must be done then. I am now
<br/>busy at them. When the first row of thatch
<br/>is on "I shall sleep a month" The <span class="">letter to
<br/>the <span class="">Directors</span></span> is not finished &amp; lies like an
<br/>incubus on my mind. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> make it
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to please myself. Tired out every night
<br/>I fancy I feel like you in your per-
<br/>petual bustle. I have been in bustles
<br/>frequently but never felt as now But
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> by the above ask help either
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>sideways or anyways. I just speak
<br/>as I feel. The more we toil here the
<br/>sweeter rest will be. Let us look to
<br/>the Heavenly rest &amp; peace with more
<br/>intense desires. <span class="">Mary</span> I suppose will
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>give all the news I have none</p>

<br/>Thank you for the <span class="">Music Book</span> I am precentor now
<br/>&amp; such a precentor! I am in agonies before
<br/>I can screw out anything like a tune &amp; then <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Rira</span></span> drowns
<br/>me. I have to watch for a chink here and there in his voice 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>&amp; stick in a note just to let them hear their leader is not asleep</p>

<br/><p class="p ">I mentioned your waggon. As it was
<br/>principally for the beads you will not
<br/>of course send it now. Fear we do not
<br/>thank you sufficiently for all the things
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>sent It is not want of gratitude but want
<br/>of thought prevents us enumerating all the
<br/>things &amp; thanking for each May be the gratitude
<br/>is not quite the thing either. Thank you
<br/>for the barren cow consolation. It equals
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>what one might have given the gravedigger's
<br/>wife who complained of the hardness of the
<br/>times. "Naething doing at a<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">ll</span> noo, <span class="">Jamie</span> has na
<br/>had a job for three weeks, I dinna ken hoe
<br/>we can fen ava". I have got seeds of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>gigantic tree 51 feet in diameter. Very
<br/>good food, <span class="">native</span> testimony. The one
<br/>I broke has a good flavour, you will
<br/>taste. These are small. I have seen them as
<br/>large as ostrich eggs. <span class="">Oswal</span> &amp; <span class="">Murray</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>may take them down. They were
<br/>extremely kind to us. The former promises
<br/>to send seeds from <span class="">India</span> &amp; the latter
<br/>offered to do anything in his power in 
<br/><span class="">Scotland</span>. If I had had the money I

<br/>should have entrusted him with an order
<br/>for a magic lantern. It would be cheaper in
<br/><span class="">Edinburgh</span> than <span class="">London</span> &amp; he being acquainted
<br/>with many ship captains says he can send
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>anything safely. Surgical instruments are ⅔<span class="sup ">ds</span>
<br/>cheaper in <span class="">Edinburgh</span> than <span class="">London</span>. Did you
<br/>talk about <span class="">Rome</span> Masepa hela. The account
<br/>reconciled me to the <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: illegible">[      ]</span> of the Bechuanas
<br/>they talked frequently about <span class="">Edwards</span>. We
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>could with difficulty answer their questions
<br/>they were so pointed. But we avoided saying
<br/>anything to shew we were obnoxious. He <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span>
<br/>has not however observed the same rule
<br/>respecting us. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Murray</span> said "<span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> is the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>coarsest &amp; most uncouth man I ever saw
<br/>I was ashamed to be seen in his <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">presence</span><span class="add  above">company</span>"
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Oswal</span> said, What is that tall queer looking
<br/>man we saw at <span class="">Motito</span>? "He seems to speak 
<br/>as if he were always in a rage" Many
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>questions were put to <span class="">Mary</span> when I was absent
<br/>which shewed <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> E</span> had been going on
<br/>at a fine rate to them. She felt very
<br/>much at a loss what to answer. <span class="add  above">He</span> told
<br/>them he intended to go all along the <span class="">East
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>coast</span> before he returned. He likewise told
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Greig</span> that he intended doing wonders in
<br/>the travelling line northwards. How daring
<br/>I was to make such a one an appendix

<br/>Whether he has done anything or not when last 
<br/>here or whether it is merely the effect of
<br/>knowing that we shall leave, the people
<br/>now <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> turn out to the meetings. We
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>have not a quarter of the former number
<br/>so I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> feel bound to remain here longer
<br/>than I can help. Before his visit
<br/>the house was generally quite full, since then
<br/>we have scarcely ever ⅓ of the former number
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>The only relaxation we have is half an
<br/>hour in the garden before sun set trans-
<br/>-planting. <span class="">Mary</span> is a real gardener &amp; enjoys
<br/>this much when not too tired. She is
<br/>wonderfully well. We have had some
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>dishes of Scotch Kale, spinach, leaves
<br/>of Mangold Wurzil, carrots an inch in
<br/>diameter. Lettuces we shall have in abundance
<br/>&amp; broccoli &amp; cabbages &amp; turnips ad nauseum
<br/>endure in abundance but we <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>how to eat all our good things. Perhaps
<br/>I shall turn out a half gardener at my
<br/>ain hand like the boys <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">brither</span> <span class="">Jock</span> &amp;
<br/>the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">diel</span> at sinning. I like it very much
<br/>Many thanks for the vine cuttings. When you
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>come you must give me some instructions
<br/>Send out some oats &amp; barley from <span class="">England</span>
<br/>The latter is perhaps superior, the former may
	<br/>
<br/>go to comfort the stomachs of <span class="">Ann</span>'s winged friends if
<br/>you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> like to sow it.</p>
