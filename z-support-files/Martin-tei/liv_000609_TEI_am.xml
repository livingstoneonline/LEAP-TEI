<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear Father
<lb/>We were very sorry to hear of the toss 
<lb/>your system <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> from the mill. The pain must
<lb/>have been intense for an extensive <term type="ailment">laceration</term>
<lb/>is of all others the most irritating. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ashton</persName>
<lb/>seems to have done his duty in the surgical line
<lb/>the only difference I should have suggested in
<lb/>the treatment might not have pleased you as 
<lb/>it would have been a simplification and
<lb/>might have appeared as doing less than duty
<lb/>You ought to have had a strong <term type="medicament">opiate</term> as <!-- Not sure if opiate and Morphia (line 15) are medicaments or prescriptions... HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>soon as possible in order to allay or
<lb/>prevent the effects of the shock on the
<lb/>system. <term type="medicament">Morphia</term> perhaps repeated for a day
<lb/>or two and afterwards if pain prevented
<lb/>sleep, the wound dressed with lint dipped
<lb/>in water after the bleeding ceased or suppurati<add place="above">-on</add>
<lb/>fairly begun. Till then nothing but dry
<lb/>lint is necessary. If there is too much
<lb/>inflammation set up in the wound and
<lb/>it looks red &amp; angry (Like <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> R</persName>) warm 
<lb/>water frequently poured over the lint and
<lb/>evaporation prevented by the whole being covered

<lb/><choice><sic>covered</sic><corr/></choice> over with oil silk or oil cloth and a <!-- Adrian, is this additional "covered" coded correctly? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>little cooling medicine will soon relieve it and
<lb/>is far better than <term type="medicament">poultices</term>. The wound <!-- Is poultices a medicament, or no coding needed? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>should never be washed. Pus is the best
<lb/>salve. In dressing the skin around alone
<lb/>needs cleaning - the sponge ought not to
<lb/>touch the red flesh. If the new parts
<lb/>springing up use above the surrounding 
<lb/>skin or are too large &amp; flabby a little of  
<lb/>what salves are usually composed, Zinc

<lb/>in the water and applied Nature does all
<lb/>the water dressing is now used more than
<lb/>any other where people are willing to pay
<lb/>without a farrago of <term type="occupation">doctoring</term> and is
<lb/>asserted by those who have the best 
<lb/>means of judging as better than any other
<lb/>Hope you will never need to apply it on 
<lb/>your own person. Shall not be surprised
<lb/>if you feel numbness &amp;c in your little &amp; 
<lb/>next finger for some time to come. It
<lb/>was a mercy the arm was not lost you 
<lb/>will be obliged to spend your time in 
<lb/>better work than <term type="occupation">roofing</term> &amp; other manual  

	

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000609_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>labours. That which although all very necessary
<lb/>are not to be compared to the effects of translations
<lb/>for these will be known when our stations
<lb/>swept away &amp; we all dead &amp; rotten. I am glad
<lb/>to think as it is the left arm you may be just
<lb/>as useful as ever. I have got up the roof
<lb/>and <persName>Mebola</persName> is now at the third row in <term type="occupation">thatching</term>
<lb/>I felt very nervous in <term type="occupation">roofing</term> this time in <w>conseq<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>uence</w> of a piece of lath breaking &amp; setting me 
<lb/>aswinging in the air like a pendulum. All my
<lb/>operations aloft were conducted after that in  
<lb/>the crawling order and in perpetual fear of 
<lb/>coming down by the run. The walls
<lb/>in consequence of long detention at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>were sadly dilapidated on my return and 
<lb/>had we enjoyed the usual supply of rain 
<lb/>we should have found them prostrate. Is
<lb/>it the prince of the power of the air who 
<lb/>avenges drought at <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName> this year
<lb/>As was last season at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>? If he has
<lb/>the power I suppose we may say He has the 
<lb/>will &amp; no mistake. The <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> is short 
<lb/>burned &amp; shooting into ear at about 2 feet
<lb/>from the ground and I suppose many think 
<lb/>we are the cause</p>


	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000609_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>We have so many clouds around us I believe
<lb/>we are to be favoured with success soon 
<lb/>And I feel the more inclined to stick to
<lb/>and persevere in the great work: I would 
<lb/>not go back to live at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName> with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>for the good word of seven or even seventeen 
<lb/>ladies, for though I liked &amp; do still love 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> the prospects are so much 
<lb/>more encouraging, here there is no <w>com<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-parison</w>. This although in addition contentions 
<lb/>between the tribes. <persName>Edwards</persName> dirt &amp;c I have got 
<lb/>the <orgName>Boers</orgName> about my ears. I send a note we 
<lb/>got last week, almost if I understand it right  
<lb/>prohibiting farther operations without their 
<lb/>sanction. As they seem to know perfectly 
<lb/>of this station and are only five days distant 
<lb/>We thought it would be imprudent to take 
<lb/>no notice of their mandate so I answered 
<lb/>shortly in English by informing them <!-- Are languages tagged? HB 6-19-13 --> <!-- I don't think so AM -->
<lb/>of my object. An object which they 
<lb/>as professing <orgName>Christians</orgName> approve (?) and 
<lb/>which they I hoped would endeavour to promote 
<lb/>To this I added I was a <term type="nationality">Scotchman</term> &amp; MC. <!-- unsure of abbr, ks, 9.1.13- Possibly Mr Cumming? HB 6-19-13 -->and

<lb/><choice><sic>and</sic><corr/></choice> without promising any obedience to their order <!-- Adrian, is this additional "and" coded correctly? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>I hoped to visit them at some future time and  
<lb/>might be of some service to the afflicted.
<lb/>We thought civility the best mode of dealing in the 
<lb/>affair. </p><p><space dim="horizontal" extent="5" unit="chars"/>A <term type="occupation">chief</term> named <persName>Mokhatla</persName> lives in their <!-- Is this really the end of a paragraph, or just one of DL's spacings? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>direction and although he would be glad of <persName>Paul</persName>
<lb/>to come and live with him he says the <orgName>Boers</orgName>
<lb/>would not allow it. As it seems a favourable  
<lb/>opening. He being a sensible <choice><sic>agreable</sic><corr>agreeable</corr></choice> man <w>per-

<lb/>to hunt every winter for <term type="animal">sealcows</term>. They may come 
<lb/>sooner But we feel at perfect ease whether 
<lb/>they come or not - I should not like them  
<lb/>to come in my absence. If here I have no

<lb/><persName>Saul</persName> coming here. He will not be so well as  
<lb/>he is at <placeName><settlement type="village">Motito</settlement></placeName> and those who invited him 
<lb/>must have told him so. <persName>Mebala</persName> has far

<lb/>every one of his <term type="animal">goats</term> and <term type="animal">sheep</term> died. The ground
<lb/>he could irrigate is about 100 <choice><abbr>yds</abbr><expan>yards</expan></choice> in length and in
<lb/>my garden which is situated in every respect 
<lb/>as his is, if drought continues a week although 
<lb/>I turn the whole of the water in a piece of ground 
<lb/>four yards in breadth &amp; one hundred paces in 
<lb/>length will not be irrigated in half a day - <persName>Saul</persName>
<lb/>knows all both losses in <term type="animal">cattle</term> at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and that <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName> is worse than <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName> so
<lb/>if he comes it must be for other reasons 
<lb/>than those <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Lemue</expan></choice></persName> might ascribe And indeed ascribe 
<lb/>what she likes her words are wind to me.</p>
<lb/><p>When <persName>Saul</persName> came to <term type="occupation">nurse</term> <persName>Mebala</persName> after the bite
<lb/>of the <term type="animal">lion</term> he said to me "Marry &amp; I shall come &amp;
<lb/>live with you" To this I only replied by the joke 
<lb/>of offering to employ him to go &amp; seek a wife for  
<lb/>me as I had then no time myself. I should 
<lb/>be sorry to write him as a member of another 
<lb/>society and equally so to say a word against him 
<lb/>coming ᅳ I put <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Lemue</expan></choice></persName> in nearly the same
<lb/>category with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ross</persName>. She must side with 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> or woe betide her ᅳ It is not now 
<lb/>convenient to indulge in the style of invective 
<lb/>against your egotism &amp; ingratitude for the immense 
<lb/>assistance <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lemue</persName> afforded you in criticism
<lb/>(of which criticism by the bye they confessed
<lb/>you had not availed yourself in actual printing)
<lb/>And which was the burden of their song on
<lb/>every occasion your speeches or <bibl>letters</bibl> came

	

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000609_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Lemue</expan></choice></persName> knows <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> would make disclosures if she did
<lb/>not keep friendly. Having heard so much of your  
<lb/>egotism before I ever saw you in this country 
<lb/>I remember having considerable dislike to you 
<lb/>and as your faults were always mentioned in the 
<lb/>deploring <term type="animal">crocodile</term> strain I thought the men 
<lb/>really mourning <add place="below">˄</add> <add place="above">&amp; praying</add> over your frailties. As however 
<lb/>I am now favoured with the same lugubrious
<lb/>prayers and dolorous wailings I know their
<lb/>value &amp; wonder at my own utter ignorance 
<lb/>of mankind</p>
<lb/><p>As for <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <supplied cert="high">Ross</supplied></persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ross</persName> I feel strongly inclined 
<lb/>to expose their conduct towards me. I believed 
<lb/>he treated me most ungentlemanly in the way 
<lb/>and when I looked back after our arrival at 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> I felt humbled that I had not 
<lb/>been more patient of insult &amp;c than I had been 
<lb/>I thought I should have borne more and 
<lb/>have uniformly taken the blame in part 
<lb/>upon myself. After accusing me of an 
<lb/>intention "to impose on his wife", calling me 
<lb/>"a liar" when I denied it &amp; repeating the 
<lb/>insult in several ways. I could <hi rend="underline">not</hi> esteem 
<lb/>him. My heart burned with indignation 
<lb/>for I was conscious of just as little inclination 
<lb/>towards his wife as I now have towards
<lb/>my grandmother<supplied>'</supplied>s <term type="animal">cat</term>. Yet I felt distressed

	

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000609_0008"><!--pb/@n='4v'--></pb>
<lb/>that being a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> I had these feelings. Many
<lb/>a sleepless night I spent &amp; wished I were not
<lb/>a <term type="occupation">missionary</term>. Well when I came to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>I tried to subdue my feelings &amp; never mentioned 
<lb/><choice><sic>any thing</sic><corr>anything</corr></choice> to any one. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Edwards</persName> has repeatedly 
<lb/>told that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ross</persName> did not allow three days to
<lb/>pass over before she began and made statements 
<lb/>respecting me which to use <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>'s own words 
<lb/>"made us afraid of you" And - that I never 
<lb/>said one word about the <persName>Ross</persName>es for more 
<lb/>than three months. Why did I then begin? 
<lb/>Because <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> then began to tell me all
<lb/>that they had heard from the <persName>Ross</persName>es about me  
<lb/>their statements being gross misrepresentations 
<lb/>I was compelled to tell my way of viewing the 
<lb/>subject. The <persName>Ross</persName>es went on month 
<lb/>after month retailing scandal <add place="below">˅</add> <add place="above">against me</add> &amp; that was 
<lb/>just as regularly reretailed to me at table 
<lb/><choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> I was sick of it. I would have spoken 
<lb/>to the <persName>Ross</persName>es about it But was so disgusted 
<lb/>with them I could not. This continuous 
<lb/>scandalizing which I bore as a nail in my 
<lb/>shoe for two years determined on no 
<lb/>account to quarrel again I called to 
<lb/>my friends and to <persName>Inglis</persName> amongst the
<lb/>number most abominable <term type="animal">mule</term> headed
<lb/>wickedness and I shall repeat it as long
<lb/>as I live if <persName>Ross</persName> does not acknowledge it</p>

<lb/><p>As a specimen of the details with which I was furnished
<lb/>her first child was on the point of strangulation 
<lb/>in birth as <persName>Rachel</persName> did not know how to deliver 
<lb/>the head, I assisted the child immediately by doing what 
<lb/>you know. But as it is very simple I never thought 
<lb/>of mentioning it <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> told by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>R</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>told both <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Helmore</persName> &amp; <persName><supplied>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi></supplied> Lemue</persName> that I had "done 
<lb/>nothing at all but pretend that the child was 
<lb/>in danger in order to take credit to myself. I was 
<lb/>also told that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ross</persName> said that when previously 
<lb/>consulted by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>R</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName> (Having explained the nature 
<lb/>of the pains) I had tried to make her afraid 
<lb/>and other things of a like nature. Now in  
<lb/>reference to this I have felt if they did not 
<lb/>choose to feel gratitude &amp; <persName>Ross</persName> never once 
<lb/>thanked meᅳ They need not have told a lie 
<lb/>in order to detract from my character. I never 
<lb/>boasted of what I had done. Why <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> hatred 
<lb/>towards me. Why pursue me with such 
<lb/>inveterate enmity when during my whole 
<lb/>intercourse with them after coming to 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> I never said an uncivil word 
<lb/>or did one uncivil thing. Why begin 
<lb/>detraction and lie to <persName>Mary Moffat</persName> about 
<lb/>me as soon as she came to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>If I did <add place="inline">˄</add> <add place="above">not</add> feel that I should degrade myself
<lb/>by giving her an opportunity of familiar

	

	<pb n="0010" facs="liv_000609_0010"><!--pb/@n='5v'--></pb>
<lb/>intercourse I should speak to her frankly But
<lb/>after being told by <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>R</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName> that he looked to me 
<lb/>"with infinite contempt" "never mind" said 
<lb/>he to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>R</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName> "We are far above him" I never
<lb/>come near them but feel I have no more

<lb/>that you may know whether I have had 
<lb/>reason to speak against them. I have 
<lb/>spoken against them and can repeat
<lb/>every word again. I should like to bring 
<lb/>a few things like the above to their remembrance 
<lb/>and if I met him should probably do so</p>
<lb/><p>We thank you heartily for the bellows

<lb/>the present <term type="occupation">messengers</term> will take on the note to you
<lb/>if he refuses to write we shall have a guess 
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> was very much pleased with your message
