<br/><p class="p ">My very dear friends</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Afraid lest when you hear of the reception
<br/>of <span class="">a letter from me</span> by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> Cecil</span> you should think I had forgotten you
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I hasten to send you one too &amp; hope although it is of a later date
<br/>it will be favoured with a more speedy passage than the
<br/>other.<span class="space" title="space: 3 words ">                        </span>I am now quite recovered from the effects of a
<br/>long journey I made in company with <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> into the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>and lest you should feel anyway concerned about my comforts
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I may mention that I have as many as I can desire; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> &amp; M<span class="sup ">rs</span>
<br/>E.</span> are excellent people <span class="space" title="space: 1 chars ">  </span>The longer I live with them I like them
<br/>the better. Perhaps you will be pleased to hear I was not permitted
<br/>to commence housekeeping here. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> &amp; M<span class="sup ">rs</span>E.</span> insisted that they
<br/>should take all of the trouble of lodging me &amp;c. And although I felt loathe
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to put them to any additional trouble I was fairly compelled to it
<br/>They likewise entertain Good old <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hamilton</span> in the same manner 
<br/>Another friend! whom you know has not conducted himself in the 
<br/>most amiable manner to myself, is behaving in rather a strange
<br/>sort of way to our bretheren here. Indeed I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> help thinking he
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>is what you in <span class="">England</span> call a sort of imbecile. But he had
<br/>ability enough to vex me thoroughly on sundry occasions. It will
<br/>&amp; I hope has done me good notwithstanding the nauseousness of
<br/>the draughts</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Our journey was very long for this is a country of prodigious
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>extent &amp; the people live far apart from each other. We however
<br/>visited some who had not previously been visited by missionaries
<br/>Traders have been much farther than we &amp; they endure more
<br/>fatigue in search of ivory than we do in endeavouring to
<br/>gather in immortal souls to the Saviour's Kingdom. But I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>hope this <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> be said again with truth: We hope to do 
<br/>more for souls after this than the <span class="">men of the world</span> for gain
<br/>I intend soon to go into the <span class="">Interior</span> again. &amp; I perhaps will
<br/>go farther than in this last Journey. for although we travelled 
<br/>about 700 miles we were not more than 250 directly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>North.<span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>Circumstances compelled us to go in the hottest
<br/>season of the year, but you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> understand <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">what</span> heat of Sun
<br/>means by feeling his summer rays in <span class="">England</span>; When we
<br/>came even here although the difference in latitude is
<br/>not great. It felt quite cool &amp; pleasant compared to the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>the sun was "indeed <span class="unclear">A</span>ngry Angry" <span class="add  above">a <span class="">native</span> expression</span> in the wide wide waterless

<br/>sufferings or call them such for I bore it I thought quite 
<br/>as well as the <span class="">natives</span>. I only wish to give you an
<br/>idea of the country I am to consider my own hereafter. It was
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>really intolerably hot. The very flies sought the shade &amp; the
<br/>enormous centipedes coming out by mistake I suppose from
<br/>their holes were roasted to death on the burning sand</p>
	
	<p class="ab ">
<br/>I have seen several of the Bechuana chiefs &amp; my candid opinion of them all except one is they are a set of hereditary downright 
<br/>asses &amp; it is no scandal to say so for generally they are much more insignificant in every <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 3 chars, cause: illegible">[   ]</span><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">respect</span> than to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">poorest</span>

<br/><span class="">Jany 4<span class="sup ">th</span> 1842</span> No opportunity seems likely to occur of sending this but I leave it with <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hamilton</span> I am 
<br/>about to start for a distant part of the country Yours Affectionately <span class="">DL</span> I expect letters from you 
<br/>&amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moore</span> when I return 
	</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Water is very scarce towards the <span class="">north</span> But there is plenty of game
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>both large &amp; small near all the watering places, so we usually 
<br/>got something to eat as well as drink at them. And then if
<br/>you saw the mirth &amp; laughter of the <span class="">natives</span> when cutting up an 
<br/>animal you should feel perhaps more strongly the meaning of
<br/>the expression "rejoicing as in the day of slaughter" then you have
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>before - <span class="space" title="space: 1 chars ">  </span>Great numbers of the <span class="">natives</span> always turned <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">out with</span>
<br/>us from every village in order to get a share of whatever might 
<br/>be killed. &amp; It did not matter although we killed nothing for the 
<br/>first 40 or 50 miles. If they got after that a backful of meat 
<br/>they returned rejoicing in their good success. Sometimes at night
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>an amusing circumstance occurred putting as sudden a stop to
<br/>their laughing roasting &amp; stewing, as if a thunderbolt had fallen 
<br/>amongst them. The approach of a wild animal towards
<br/>our fires, then there was such a rushing for spears guns &amp;c  
<br/>the belly was entirely forgotten in our anxiety to do some valorous
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>action - but courage was <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">not</span> never at night (fortunately for us) 
<br/>put to the test. If it had it might have been found wanting</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We saw all the large game of this country except the Elephant
<br/>&amp; we saw abundance of marks where he had recently been. They
<br/>must have immense power for large "camel thorn trees" 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>a kind of mimosa with wood so hard it <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> be worked by 
<br/>our chisels &amp;c. were lying twisted down to the ground, or split
<br/>down the centre in order to allow them to eat the branches at the 
<br/>top. They must have great power of digestion too for the 
<br/>branches they had eaten were as thick as my thumb &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>covered with large strong thorns more than an inch in length
<br/>The Giraffe is very beautiful &amp; so are the Zebra &amp; ostrich
<br/>but the Rhinoceros is like a huge pig; we got one Zebra
<br/>as large as <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Mr P's"><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> P</span>s</span> grey mare &amp; the meat was very good -- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">But the people will be more interesting  you than <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">wild</span> beasts 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Although I believe the latter are greater in number than the 
<br/>former.<span class="space" title="space: 2 chars ">    </span>They are quite a timid <span class="">race of people</span>, &amp; there is
<br/>not the least danger to be apprehended by any <span class="">European</span> 
<br/>traveling amongst them.<span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>They can be cruel enough
<br/>to each other but are very much afraid of the "<span class="">whites</span>"
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>The terrible effects of the guns of a few <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> has contributed more
<br/>than anything else to produce this fear of us &amp; now through the 
<br/>whole country they have an impression that "<span class="">whites</span>" are decidedly 
<br/>their superiors - <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>Everywhere we were received with respect 
<br/>but more especially by those who had never seen a white face 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>before. My hair was in their eyes a very curious affair indeed 
<br/>and the wife of one of the chiefs very innocently put up her hand 
<br/>to my nose to make herself sure by the sense of feeling that it really 
<br/>was so far elevated from the level of my face as it appeared to 
<br/>be &amp; were not like her own little flat thing. When  told of   
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>the creation it seemed strange to them how one father should 
<br/>have some children with such sharp noses white skins &amp; 
<br/>eyes that can see everything while others had flat noses 



	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>short hair &amp; their skins like pots - <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>About praying to God they had 
<br/>many strange notions. Because we kneeled &amp; bowed down our head they 
<br/>thought our God must surely be in the ground. <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span>One woman told me 
<br/>when I was looking at some of them drawing water out of a deep well 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>that she would pray to God after this. <span class="space" title="space: 1 words ">        </span> The nature of her prayers 
<br/>I suppose will be like that of one of her <span class="">countrymen</span> who told me a 
<br/>day or two afterwards when he &amp; I were returning from shooting 
<br/>a Rhinoceros that he had prayed for success in getting game 
<br/>before we went &amp; now the prayer was answered. We sometimes 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>had to exert ourselves considerably in pursuit of game to supply the 
<br/>wants of our people. It was no easy matter in the midst of such 
<br/>heat. some people might blame a missionary assuming the 
<br/>character of a huntsman but if they knew the toil connected 
<br/>with it they would never suspect he did it from motives of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>pleasure -</p><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span><p class="p ">They are very superstitious. We had 8 with 
<br/>us from the Bo-quain tribe. (Bakuain) who come for the purpose 
<br/>of trading with an <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: elephant's">elephants</span> tooth &amp; a few skins they had got 
<br/>one of them a hearty openhearted youth who had been a 
<br/>soldier of the notorious Marauder <span class="">Moselekatsi</span> &amp; had with his 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>own hands killed 3 men, attached himself to me as a particular 
<br/>friend of mine (we have in almost every village a particular 
<br/>friend and although the chief burden of the friendship rests upon 
<br/>us we encourage it for when arriving at a village our 
<br/>friend is sure to turn out with a bowl of porridge, milk or 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>boiled beans which <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">we</span><span class="add  above">is</span> really most acceptable after <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: living">livin</span>
<br/>chiefly on meat for some time) As I liked this hearty 
<br/>fellow I allowed him to ride sometimes. But one day I requested  
<br/>him to bring me a human bone lying near. With an exclam
<br/>-ation of horror he replied, "My friend how can you ask me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>to do that. How can I love you after this. Nobody but <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">bewitchers</span>
<br/>use human bones. I am afraid you are one." And from 
<br/>that time he never would even look into my waggon
<br/>he traveled about 200 miles after that on foot</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In order to try him I promised to reward him if he should bring it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>but he declared he would not do it Although I should give him 
<br/>as much as he had agreed for with <span class="">Mr E.</span> to go as servant 
<br/>to <span class="">Graham</span>'s town &amp; back again, first going home to his own 
<br/>country to ask his <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: father's">father s</span> consent, see his wife &amp; child 
<br/>&amp; then return. The whole distance he offered to travel 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>being about 1500 miles - He was quite friendly in all other 
<br/>respects, a most obliging fellow but that he could not get 
<br/>over at all ---- </p><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span><p class="p ">I am sorry I said the baby's clothes 
<br/>were not the thing for me. I hope you did not think me

<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>purpose &amp; even in my own hands they would have been 
<br/>of considerable use. I should have liked to have had one suit 
<br/>of them now for a child that has been named not <span class="">David L.</span>
<br/>but <span class="">Monari Livingston</span>, or <span class="">Master L.</span> &amp; very likely they will add 
<br/>the word for D<span class="sup ">r</span> yet so my poor little black representative will 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>have a handle to both ends of his name. I may mention for the

<br/>they are sold for oxen &amp;c, when mere children to be wives to those who 
<br/>perhaps have several already. The men care not how many they have 
<br/>for as the women sow the corn &amp; cultivate all the other articles of cons-
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>-umption as well as build the houses; The more wives the more corn &amp;c. 
<br/>and when they are old or a little ugly from disease they are put away 
<br/>&amp; must shift for themselves by digging up roots until they perish 
<br/>from hunger or are devoured by wild beasts. Do your young 
<br/>people value their privleges? I am sure if they for one night only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>heard the dismal howling of the wolf or were once wakened up with 
<br/>a start by the horrid roar of the lion, they would never forget 
<br/>them &amp; I think they would pray more earnestly for the spread of 
<br/>the <span class="">gospel</span> into these dark places of the earth - A poor little 
<br/>girl was brought to me at one village she had been enduring intense  
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>pain in her eyes from a certain disease for about a month  
<br/>and now they had both burst. During all that time she had no 
<br/>comforts neither by night nor by day. Although I had to adopt 
<br/>severe measures to stop the disease. She never complained, And 
<br/>this was a solitary case amongst many. Many both men &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>women were so ill they could not crawl to the waggon. They 
<br/>have no comfort here &amp; they have no hope of anything better in the 
<br/>world to come - I could fill a letter. many letters telling you about 
<br/>their sorrows but this will suffice. Pray for the outpouring 
<br/>of the spirit upon our feeble labours that they may result in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>turning many of these <span class="">heathen</span> to the Lord --- You have I hope 
<br/>heard from <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Drummond</span>. Please let me know how the lad
