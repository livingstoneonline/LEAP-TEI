<br/>Boy I have nothing more to trouble you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>with now that it is appointed for 
<br/><span class="">Hendrick</span> to accompany him. <span class="">Paul</span>
<br/>expected the conveyance of my waggon
<br/>for <span class="">Isaac</span> but the intention of 
<br/>sending it having been relinquished 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he now sends his own. They 
<br/>have some hankering after <span class="">Francina</span>
<br/>but having disuaded the father from 
<br/>sending for her I hope he will refrain 
<br/>The house has at length got a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>coat of clay on its top. This was 
<br/>accomplished today. The kitchen 
<br/>and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: bedroom">bed room</span> with the vorhuis
<br/>are furnished. Two inside walls 
<br/>alone remain to be raised a few 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>feet. We go to <span class="">Mabotsa</span> on

<br/>friday (this is Wednesday Evening) to remove 
<br/>our duds &amp;c. The white ants are already

<br/>to try our inventive powers for extermination</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Cumming</span> left a good deal of 
<br/>powder under my care with liberty to 
<br/>assist any of the people with it for 
<br/>karosses whom I thought fit. Fortun<br/>-ately my engagements prevented my 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>using that power with one exception 
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> is now apprehensive of 
<br/>an attack and looked very queer 
<br/>when told that I should place <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>Cumming</span>'s powder back again 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>into the hands of its owners. And 
<br/>never mend a gun while there 
<br/>was any probability of its being 
<br/>used in shedding blood - strange 
<br/>to say he goes on reading and listens 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to preaching with as much attention 
<br/>as ever. He quotes <span class="">Malura</span>'s advice 
<br/>in justification of his late deed

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>&amp; declares he will stand everything but a 
<br/>direct attack on his town if from a 
<br/>nation not his subjects. Says his reason 
<br/>for not telling us was I would have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>gone before or with them and spoiled 
<br/>all. For they persevere in plaguing 
<br/>him because they know he has 
<br/>a teacher to hinder him from attacking 
<br/>them. The fellow does not want arguments 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he would beat many who look with con<br/>tempt on <span class="">savages</span> as void of sophistry 
<br/>"unsophisticated children of nature" say they 
<br/>A funny mother and stranger children 
<br/>verily. Had <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ross</span> been the first 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>who got <span class="">Malura</span> to consent to hear 
<br/>the <span class="">gospel</span> he would not <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">have</span> found it 
<br/>so easy as entering on other men's 
<br/>labours. Had I been to the <span class="">committee</span> 
<br/>meeting I suspect this pill might 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>have been given to the Translator of 
<br/>the Flower gathered. This last was 
<br/>denounced by <span class="">Edwards</span> in no meas<br/>-ured terms at this time

<br/>and a building line finds its way out 
<br/>among the sticks of the tent? this brings 
<br/>to my recollection the other tent. <span class="">Paul</span>
<br/>brought it and said it was to be left with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>us, we supposed till an opportunity of 
<br/>returning it occurred. A short time 
<br/>afterwards he required it again as a shelter 
<br/>for his family till their house was 
<br/>finished. Knowing you would have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>no objection to this I let him have it 
<br/>and he has used it ever since. I have 
<br/>just been out to enquire if he could 
<br/>not send it with <span class="">Hendrick</span>. But he 
<br/>says he does not understand how it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>is. Whether he is to buy it or give it 
<br/>to me to be sent back. I think it 
<br/>better to let it remain till you inform 
<br/>him. He seems to like it. I am 
<br/>very glad of the "<span class="">Lancets</span>" I thank you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>heartily for ordering them. I shall pay 
<br/>2⅔<span class="sup ">ds</span> price or the whole if you allow 
<br/>me to keep them. Hope this is not covetous<span class="add  below">ness</span>

<br/>I am very thankful for the promise of old iron
<br/>my smithifying has been at a stand for 
<br/>some time partly because of the house &amp; 
<br/>partly because I was afraid of running 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>through my stock. I often thrashed at it 
<br/>till I was fairly done up. You did not 
<br/>tell me how to temper cold chisels 
<br/>I shall need mine tempered soon for 
<br/>I must cut through a band of one

<br/>as large as that you cured exists 
<br/>which I must rectify. <span class="underline ">Please remember
