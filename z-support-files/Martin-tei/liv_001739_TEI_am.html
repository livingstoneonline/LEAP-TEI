<br/>the statements respecting the treatment endured
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>by the Makololo missionaries are perfectly
<br/>astounding, yet, though far from supposing
<br/>myself to be proof against misrepresentation
<br/>I cannot <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> how I could have been
<br/>so grievously misled as you imagine - If
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>you allow me to state a few particulars
<br/>connected with our visit I may possibly
<br/>appear not altogether unreasonable in
<br/>withholding my assent to the statements so
<br/>generally <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>, even should the opinion
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>that the mission ought to be abandoned not
<br/>be modified -</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">Sekeletu</span> was labouring under a skin
<br/>disease when we arrived which we did not 
<br/>then know but now believe to be leprosy -
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>He was shut up apart from <span class="">his people</span> and
<br/>with the exception of his mother and a near
<br/>relative, no one was admitted to his presence
<br/>save <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> and myself. He was low</p>

<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Livingstone</span> joined me in good health on <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Thu</span> 1<span class="sup underline ">st</span> <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">currt</span></span>.

<br/><p class="p ">spirited enough in the belief that the disease had
<br/>been inflicted by <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: witchcraft">witch craft</span> for which some
<br/>influential headmen had been executed, but
<br/>he treated us with exactly the same <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: cordiality">cordialty</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>as he did in former years when I was alone
<br/>He was by no means popular, and was believed
<br/>by many to be more deformed by the disease
<br/>than we found him to be - Some had talked
<br/>openly of deposing him - which was equivalent
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to killing him - but from both well and ill-
<br/>affected we <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> the unvarying testimony
<br/>that <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> </span> and <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Helmore</span> had been highly valued
<br/>by <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">both</span> chief and people. The subject tribes
<br/>are by no means so tongue-tied there as they
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>are under <span class="">Mosilikatze</span>, yet not at <span class="">Sesheke</span> and
<br/><span class="">Linyanti</span> alone did they speak well of our
<br/>departed friend but on the <span class="">East coast</span>
<br/>utterance was given occasionally to expressions
<br/>respecting <span class="">Helmore</span> which were particularly
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>gratifying - <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> who alone of our
<br/>company understands Sichuana <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> the
<br/>very same impressions that I did - <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium"><span class="">Moboka</span></span>
<br/>the son of a man who escaped execution in
<br/>the witchcraft affair by flight to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">Lechulathebe</span></span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>had certainly no great love for <span class="">Sekeletu</span> - Yet
<br/>he spoke of <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Helmore</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span> supplies of
<br/>meat whenever he asked - and when nearly
<br/>insensible the chief asked him if he wished
<br/>meat and <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> H</span> shook his head &amp; smiled. The
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>difference of social position to which you
<br/>refer was not viewed by the Makololo as
<br/>the missionaries may have looked upon it -</p>

	<p class="ab ">
<br/>very heartily for your kind wishes and <span class="">letter</span> and also for the <span class="">Report</span></p>

<br/> beg you not to think that I in the least consider <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; "><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: ">[  ]</span></span> <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above"><span class="">Price</span></span> unfit for his office - greater

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p ">for in speaking kindly of <span class="">Helmore</span>, they often
<br/>remarked "he was just like you a man with
<br/>a heart" i-e. a kind man.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">It was also very painfully apparent that no
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>feelings of respect were entertained towards
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Price</span>. I have refrained from saying a
<br/>word to anyone on this point but yourself -
<br/>Thus, while <span class="">Helmore</span> was represented as <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span>
<br/>supplies of meat "<span class="">Price</span> might ask long enough
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>before he got any." And <span class="">Helmore</span> was said to
<br/>have declared after the death of his wife "that
<br/><span class="">Price</span> being a child might return, but he (H.)
<br/>never would go back, but proceed onward
<br/>as soon as I came whether his elders had
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>sent him." The question was put repeatedly
<br/>Why was <span class="">Helmore</span> not taken to the <span class="">Highlands</span> - 
<br/>and the answer was just what I gave you -
<br/>It is notorious that only two influential men
<br/><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">in the tribe</span> object to the whole tribe removing
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>thither and the general belief was that had
<br/>he lived a little longer <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> H.</span> would have led
<br/>them to the <span class="">South East</span>. We never heard a syllable
<br/>to his disadvantage but we overheard one man
<br/>tell another <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">who had come from <span class="">Tette</span></span> that having gone to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> P.</span>'s waggon
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>while the latter was at a meal he was kicked
<br/>away, and he added "Had <span class="">Sekeletu</span> not been
<br/>there by -- I would have fought with him -"
<br/>Some remarks made at a public meeting
<br/>at <span class="">Cape Town</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">about binding a man to his waggon wheel &amp;c</span> and fortunately unreported
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>in the <span class="">papers</span> - and a statement about using
<br/>his revolver with the Makololo made at the
<br/><span class="">Royal Observatory</span> before going into the country
<br/>at all lead me to make some abatement
    


	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>as to the colouring without questioning <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> P.</span>'s
<br/>veracity. It was abundantly evident that he
<br/>had failed to secure the respect of either chief
<br/>or <span class="">people</span>. This is no justification of any
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>wrong the Makololo may have committed,
<br/>but it is remarkable, if they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> no
<br/>provocation, that they should shew so
<br/>much rapacity towards <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Price</span>, and leave
<br/>my goods safely in my waggon &amp; in their
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>huts though the boxes are unlocked.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As to the further prosecution of this mission
<br/>I am very glad to see in your <span class="">Report</span> since
<br/>I began this <span class="">letter</span> that you still look hopefully
<br/>forward. I grieve over the loss this
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>country has sustained in the departure of
<br/>our brother to his rest. Nine Englishmen
<br/>have died in that country since the discovery
<br/>of <span class="">Lake Ngami</span> - One perished by trying to save
<br/>a duck in the <span class="">Zouga</span> - Another, with his servant,
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>was lost under suspicion of foul play - Another
<br/>ran madly under the feet of an elephant -
<br/>and others blew themselves up with gunpowder
<br/>the tenth, with his wife, lies at <span class="">Linyanti</span> &amp;
<br/>of the whole he alone had an object worth
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>risking his life for. There, without a tree
<br/>within a hundred yards to mark the spot, he
<br/>rests from his labours, as good and as
<br/>devoted a missionary as ever left <span class="">England</span>.
<br/>I collected a few bones &amp; placed <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: them">him</span> over his
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>head - there is not a stone in the country - but
<br/>these will soon vanish and his memory
<br/>will remain only in men's hearts - I still
<br/>feel convinced that a flourishing mission might
<br/>be established <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">there</span> by a judicious missionary</p>

	<p class="ab ">	
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>I was only one day there &amp; went over from <span class="">Sesheke</span> only for my medicine box</p>


	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><p class="p ">P.S. It has occurred to me to add that the
<br/>treatment we <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> was not the effect
<br/>of presents as each of the men from
<br/><span class="">Tette</span> had a load of his own and they
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>would not carry much for us or their
<br/>chief. We abstained from complaining
<br/>of this as it would have caused
<br/>the confiscation of all their hard
<br/>earned property. We gave <span class="">Sekeletu</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>comparatively little &amp; may have appeared
<br/>stingy.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The want of horses was <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: severely">severly</span>
<br/>felt by <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Helmore</span> - It is not
<br/>likely that I should have recommended
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>them to one who knew the country
<br/>so well but he was seen at one
<br/>of the watering places in the Desert
