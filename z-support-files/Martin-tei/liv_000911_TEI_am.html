<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Friend</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 14 chars ">                            </span> I could not have been
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>more surprised by your own personal
<br/>appearance at <span class="">Quilimane</span> than I was
<br/>by that of <span class="">George Fleming</span> on the <span class="">10<span class="sup ">th</span></span> <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Ult.</span>
<br/>and when I witnessed all the kind
<br/>preparations you had made for my
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>comfort in travel it appeared like
<br/>a scene we see in dreaming. <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">and</span>
<br/>I had begun to fancy <span class="">my letters</span> contained
<br/>an order forthwith to return whence
<br/>I had come. On perusal however
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I found that I am somewhat to blame
<br/>in not stating explicitly my intention
<br/>to go from <span class="">Tette</span> to <span class="">Quilimane</span> soon  
<br/>after the dispatch of <span class="">my letters</span> and
<br/>thence proceed to <span class="">England</span>. I had

    

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>mentioned my plans so often I un-
<br/>-fortunately took it for granted that all
<br/>my friends knew them perfectly. And
<br/>when the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Tete">Tett</span></span> packet left I intended to
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>proceed down the river in a few days
<br/>afterwards. Indeed I fully expected to
<br/>overtake it at <span class="">Quilimane</span> but my
<br/>good friend <span class="">Major T. A. d'A Sicard</span>
<br/>the commandant of <span class="">Tette</span> generously
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>advised me to remain untill the
<br/>beginning of the healthy season in
<br/>the <span class="">Delta</span> viz.<span class="">April</span>. I was not 
<br/>without need of rest for our cattle
<br/>having all been killed by Tsetse
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I had a severe spell of trudging on
<br/>foot and had become tired 
<br/>and thin enough. My men got
<br/>food from the worthy <span class="">Major</span>
<br/>and employment in carrying
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>wood &amp; in canoe work also

    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>about 16 came down with me to <span class="">Senna</span>
<br/>eight returned thence to <span class="">Tette</span> and eight
<br/>came to <span class="">Quilimane</span> but were glad
<br/>to go back too for there was a famine
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>in the land which cut off thousands
<br/>My head man named <span class="">Sekwebu</span>
<br/>I have taken with me - a sensible
<br/>worthy <span class="">heathen</span>, but for whose tact
<br/>and knowledge of the <span class="">Zambesi</span> language 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I might not have been here today
<br/>The rest about 110 are to remain
<br/>at <span class="">Tette</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: until">till</span> I return to take them
<br/>to their own land again. Such was
<br/>my plan but a short time before 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the arrival of the Frolic I got <span class="">a letter
<br/>from the <span class="">Directors</span></span> by way of <span class="">Mosam-
<br/>bique</span> in which I am told that "they
<br/>are restricted in their power of aiding
<br/>plans connected only remotely with
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the spread of the <span class="">gospel</span>." and they
<br/>add that even though certain

    

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>obstacles (fever, tsetse &amp;c.) should prove
<br/>surmountable "the financial circumstances
<br/>of the <span class="">society</span> are not as such as to afford
<br/>any ground of <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: blotting">[  ]</span> hope that it would 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>be in a position within any definite
<br/>period to undertake untried, remote
<br/>and difficult fields of labour." I had
<br/>imagined in my simplicity that both
<br/>my preaching conversation and
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>travel were as nearly connected with
<br/>the spread of the <span class="">gospel</span> as the <span class="">Boers</span>
<br/>would allow them to be. The plan
<br/>of opening up a path from either
<br/>the <span class="">East</span> or <span class="">West coast</span> for the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>teeming population of the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>was submitted to their judgement
<br/>and secured their formal approbation
<br/>I have been seven times in peril
<br/>of my life from <span class="">savage men</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>while laboriously and without

    

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>swerving pursuing that plan, and 
<br/>never doubted but that I was in the
<br/>path of duty. Indeed so clearly did
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: perceive">percieve</span> that I was performing
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>good service to the cause of Christ    
<br/>I wrote to my brother that I would
<br/>perish rather than fail in my
<br/>enterprise. I shall not boast of what
<br/>I have done but the wonderful
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>mercies I have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> will constrain
<br/>me to follow out the work in spite
<br/>of the veto of the <span class="">Board</span>. If it is
<br/>according to the will of God means
<br/>will be provided from other quarters</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><p class="p ">I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> all the articles sent
<br/>in charge of <span class="">Captain Peyton</span> and
<br/><span class="">George Fleming</span> as noted in the
<br/>lists which accompanied them
<br/>Some, as the clothing for myself

    

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>bedding stockings &amp;c. were most
<br/>welcome and did not come certainly
<br/>before they were needed. Some
<br/>woolen articles and others which
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>would spoil by keeping I directed
<br/>to be sold and others as the desk
<br/>and work box I left at <span class="">Quilimane</span>
<br/>for future use. The money viz.
<br/>fifty sovereigns and 500 Spanish
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>dollars I took with me. I have
<br/>some debts against me up the river
<br/>for clothing &amp;c. of which though my
<br/>kind friends there refused to give
<br/>a formal account I consider
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>myself bound to repay by bringing
<br/>articles which I know they require
<br/>As I could not settle my affairs
<br/>at once I leave it for a future
<br/>time. About 18 tusks belonging

    

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>to <span class="">Sekeletu</span> are left also in charge of
<br/><span class="">Colonel Galdino José Nunes</span> in
<br/>whose house I lived at <span class="">Quilimane</span>
<br/>with orders to sell them in case
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of my death and remit the proceeds
<br/>to <span class="">Sekeletu</span>. The money from
<br/>you I reserve for oceanic use. The
<br/>dollars are said to be worth 4/2 or 4/1
<br/>only, at the <span class="">Mauritius</span> though you
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>gave I hear 4/6 for them. Rather
<br/>than part with them at such a loss 
<br/>I shall <span class="add  above">if not needed as passage money</span> <span class="add  below">^</span> keep them for the <span class="">Zambesi</span>
<br/>again. I suppose all goes down
<br/>to my account with the <span class="">society</span>.
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I prefer the overland passage to
<br/>that by the <span class="">Cape</span> because I have
<br/>a chance of a free passage from
<br/>one of the <span class="">companies</span>. P. O. O. I believe 
<br/>and none from the common
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>vessels which pass your way

    

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>I wish to come back without any
<br/>delay in <span class="">England</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I was happy to see <span class="">Ralph</span>'s name
<br/>among those who <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> prizes
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>at the college. Hope he will profit
<br/>largely by the mental discipline he
<br/>now enjoys and become fit to serve
<br/>our great Creator in his day and
<br/>generation. How are the other two 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>little <span class="">Hottentots</span> <span class="">Jessie</span> &amp; <span class="">Willie</span>? If they
<br/>lag behind <span class="">Ralph</span> and I am obliged to
<br/>write about them in a book I shall give
<br/>them <span class="">Boer</span> names as having no
<br/><span class="">Wardlaw</span> blood in them. "My Dear 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Wife" you say, and I knew not you
<br/>had one. Of course I fell into a quandary
<br/>as to who had taken charge of you,
<br/>if she had a long nose or red hair,
<br/>or squinted, but I was obliged at last
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span> the compliments with thanks
<br/>though only from as yet an abstract idea</p>

<br/>but not nearly so <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: fertile-looking">fertile looking</span>, as
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the banks of the <span class="">Zambesi</span> (inland)
<br/>I cannot of course give any notice
<br/>of my future but may tomorrow 
<br/>I intend to live on board <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">Frolic</span> till I sail 
<br/>homewards. for I had a little touch
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of my <span class="">African</span> fever yesterday &amp; the 
<br/>purer the air the better. I shall
<br/>visit <span class="">Mr Lebrun</span> when I can &amp; see
<br/>his Malagassi. At <span class="">St Augustine's
<br/>Bay</span> we saw many of them. They
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>resemble closely the better classes of
<br/>Makololo and many words in
<br/>their tongue shew them to be true <span class="">negroes</span> 
<br/>The French are causing them to
<br/>emigrate to <span class="">Bourbon</span> by promise 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of wages &amp; facilities for returning
<br/>It seems all fair and above board

    

	<span class="pb-title">0010</span>
<br/>work for they had an official of
<br/>the <span class="">French Gov<span class="underline ">t</span></span> aboard to see that none
<br/>but <span class="">free men</span> were taken</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Respecting <span class="">George Fleming</span> I suppose
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>it will be best to settle with him in
<br/><span class="">Cape Town</span> for besides not having
<br/>more money than I may need supposing
<br/>I get not a free passage the agreement
<br/>does not specify what was to be given
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>supposing he was required to do no
<br/>more than has happened. Here he has
<br/>able seaman's pay as <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Captain's">Captains</span> servant
<br/><span class="add  above">He serves me too</span> He came to <span class="">Quilimane</span> with another
<br/>man of colour who left us at
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">St Augustine's Bay</span>. He would have
<br/>found no difficulty in going to <span class="">Tete</span> as
<br/>it is all fair sailing though against
<br/>the stream. Whatever you think
<br/>proper to give please put it to my
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>account I have full confidence
<br/>in your discretion. I only feel

    

	<span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<br/>sorry that my not noticing my plans
<br/>in the <span class="">Tette</span> packet should have caused 
<br/>so much anxiety and perplexity</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I send <span class="">letters</span> for the <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>along with this. <span class="">Sekwebu</span>'s mind seems
<br/>affected by the marvels he sees. The
<br/>steamer which took us into the Port 
<br/>was a terrible apparition to him, All
<br/>are very kind to him. One who went
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to <span class="">Loanda</span> became insane also but
<br/>recovered in a few days as I hope
<br/><span class="">Sekwebu</span> will, Remember me
