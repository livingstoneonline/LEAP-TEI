<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">Kuruman</span> <span class="">18<span class="sup ">th</span> June 1843</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear <span class="">Watt</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">Your <span class="">long and excellent letter</span> I found awaiting my return from
<br/>the <span class="">Interior</span> a few days ago. I wrote you twice previous to leaving
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the <span class="">21<span class="sup ">st</span> of Feby</span> &amp; now I shall give you some account
<br/>of my sayings &amp; doings since that period. I passed northward
<br/>in nearly the same path I trode last year but I had now
<br/>different objects in view. I have told you of the massacre
<br/><span class="add  above">of the <span class="">people</span></span> of the unfortunate but brave <span class="">Sebegoe</span>. No one would go
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>with me to him for several months as every one feared
<br/>for his life. And they had some cause to fear for sever<br/>al of the people of <span class="">Kuruman</span> were there at the period
<br/>of attack on a trading visit &amp; the night previous
<br/>to the attack by <span class="">Mahura</span> they had accidentally fired a
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>gun &amp; as usual engaged in family worship. The
<br/>former deed is considered by the <span class="">people of S.</span> as the sign<br/>al by which they apprised <span class="">Mahura</span> where they were
<br/>&amp; the latter as incantations to ensure success in
<br/>their undertaking. I longed to go to him &amp; disabuse
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>his mind of the unfavourable impression against the
<br/><span class="">gospel</span> it had received but it was the above date
<br/>before I could prevail on <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: anyone">any one</span> to drive my
<br/>waggon. Well I went straight to the town
<br/>where he with the remains of his tribe have taken
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>taken up their abode &amp; entering squatted down beside
<br/>him as if I had been an old acquaintance. He
<br/>&amp; his <span class="">people</span> recognized a young man who was 
<br/>with me as having been of the <span class="">trading <span class="">party</span></span>
<br/>&amp; after the prove identification had passed 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>S. turned to me and said Why have you attacked &amp;
<br/>destroyed all my <span class="">people</span>. I gave him a Scotch
<br/>answer &amp; said Why did you refuse to listen
<br/>to the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: advice">advise</span> I gave your messengers last year
<br/>not to leave the <span class="">Bakalihari desert</span> as <span class="">Mahura</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>would certainly attack you if you did. Did your
<br/>messengers not deliver my message or did you
<br/>discredit it &amp; thus destroy yourself? I was</p>
	<p class="ab ">
<br/>If you could procure the seeds of the "asclepia gigantica" or any other
<br/>medicinal plants &amp; seal them carefully up in a bottle or tin you would
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>oblige me much. Of Cardamoms, all must be sealed from sea air</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">He was evidently surprised to get such an answer as he
<br/>imagined he had acted quite properly in all he had done. He said
<br/>he did not disbelieve my message but had been compelled by the 
<br/>sickness &amp; <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">deaths</span> of his <span class="">people</span>, want of water &amp; corn to
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>come out of the desert &amp; was on his way when he sent
<br/>messengers with the ox to me. The messengers who have
<br/>escaped the slaughter recognized me again &amp; our subsequent
<br/>intercourse was of a most friendly description. By the
<br/>bye <span class="">Sebegoe</span> lives about 10 days from this &amp; near the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>place where <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span> faced about to go home. The
<br/>oven foundries, he mentions as not having been permitted
<br/>to see I gave you an account of the reason he was
<br/>not permitted to see them as no one who has had 
<br/><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">female</span> intercourse with the other sex since the period
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of the year when they commence to work the iron
<br/>is permitted to approach as they believe firmly the
<br/>presence of such a one would certainly bewitch alias
<br/>burn the metal. This which of course always occurs
<br/>when they blow too hard is invariably attributed to
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>witchcraft. I who am a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: bachelor">batchelor</span> am permitted
<br/>to examine freely. And this spot is that at which
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> saw the notorious <span class="">Moselekatze</span>, I walked
<br/>over the site of his town &amp; the place where he
<br/>suffered his last sad defeat by the <span class=""><span class="">boors</span></span> &amp; a few
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>human bones are the only remains I could
<br/>observe of the former greatness of the tyrant
<br/>I am thus circumstantial because I shall probably be
<br/>for some time located in that very neighbourhood
<br/>I passed on to the Bakwains but the commotions
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>lately convulsed the country have produced great
<br/>changes in all I saw. <span class="">Bubi</span> has fled to another
<br/>part of the country, <span class="">Sechele</span> was fulminating
<br/>against me when I had passed him last year but
<br/><span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: fading">[    ]</span> he did not know what to do with me for
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>kindness. He told many he would lay hold on me
<br/>if I came back to this country again But to think
<br/>of laying hold of me when I am absent &amp; to look
<br/>me in the face &amp; do it are two very different things</p>
	<p class="ab ">
<br/>Please refrain from apologies it fills up so much valuable
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>space &amp; they are not worth the ink you write them with</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p ">I had a <span class="">set of most dastardly fellows</span> with me who refused to 
<br/>go with me beyond the Bakwains. Woe betide them for they
<br/>alone prevented me seeing the lake and now <span class="">Moffat</span> is on his
<br/>way hither &amp; is going to do wonders in the way of going
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>northward. I left the waggon at <span class=""><span class="">Bubi</span>'s</span> &amp; proceeded on my
<br/>pack ox more than 200 miles north of that, a distance
<br/>greater than I should have been obliged to go had I
<br/>according to my plan got the waggon on to the Bamang<br/>-wato &amp; thence proceeded to the lake. As it is if <span class="">Moffat</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>goes beyond every other <span class="">white man</span> I can tell you
<br/>he will go a good way, for I have been as far beyond
<br/>his furthest point <span class="">north</span> as he has been beyond <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>A weary way it was &amp; that too beneath a burning sun
<br/>But I can bear thirst better than the <span class="">natives</span> &amp; am as
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>tough as a "wuddy" I had the privilege of making known
<br/>the glad tidings of mercy to many who never before
<br/>heard them or saw the face of a <span class="">European</span>. I had
<br/>three wild Bakwains as my only attendants &amp; poor
<br/>fellows they served me faithfully. Every night
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>gave me the best place at the fire &amp; the first 
<br/>dive at the meat. We were entirely <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: dependent">dependant</span> on
<br/>my gun for food and many a weary <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">man</span> with an empty
<br/>stomach <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">I had</span> after the game. I killed 2 rhinoceros
<br/>8 large antelopes, we ate or rather took a "blow out"
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>over the carcass, each one then took a piece &amp;
<br/>away we trudged. You go with a tent. My tents
<br/>were growing <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: everywhere">every where</span>. A bush at my head &amp;
<br/>a fire at my feet with some grass spread under
<br/>were my necessary abodes for 3 weeks &amp; 10 days
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>The lions were very numerous &amp; sometimes came
<br/>so close, roaring tremendously, we were or rather I
<br/>was obliged to get up &amp; fire at them. I became
<br/>acquainted with many of that poor oppressed 
<br/>tribe called Bakalahari who are usually used by
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>all the other Bechuanas. They usually have fled
<br/>from us but now I got into friendship with
<br/>many as they came when they saw me in the
<br/>wilderness &amp; invited me to their villages which
<br/>are usually so situated it is very difficult to 

	

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>find them out. They are obliged to hunt almost constant
<br/>for their masters &amp; are not allowed to keep anything to
<br/>themselves of what they take Once they supplied my want
<br/>when I should have been put to shifts without their aid I
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>had the misfortune to break my finger bone when descending
<br/>the lofty rocks of the Bakaa &amp; was unable to procure
<br/>food for my <span class="">party</span> with the gun. They had had the
<br/>fortune to kill a horse a little before &amp; generously gave
<br/>me a supply which lasted till we arrived at the waggon
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Meat was my staple article of diet but I eat every<br/>thing eaten by the <span class="">natives</span>. Bread is quite out of 
<br/>the question. locusts a kind of large caterpillar &amp;c &amp;c
<br/>every thing goes down with them &amp; so they had to
<br/>do with me. I lost my way one day &amp; became
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>entirely separated from my <span class="">companions</span>. I wandered
<br/>on &amp; on &amp; on the country was a flat forest, I slept
<br/>on a tree while the lions &amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: hyenas">hyeanas</span> howled around
<br/>my airy couch. The following night late I arrived at
<br/>a <span class="">village of Bakalahari</span> &amp; right thankful I was to see
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the human face divine or rather dirty for hungry
<br/>&amp; faint &amp; weary I had often thrown myself down under
<br/>a bush &amp; thought that here I should surely die. But <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: the">the 
<br/>the</span> Lord was merciful to me &amp; <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">next day</span> I got food &amp; two
<br/>men to go in search of my <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">surviving</span> <span class="">companions</span>.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><p class="p "><span class="">Professor Owen</span> has got one box but I am waiting
<br/>for further instructions before I shall send the other, a
<br/>third box I gave in charge to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Williams</span> of <span class="">Hankey</span> an
<br/>excellent man who is now compelled to leave for <span class="">England</span>
<br/>in consequence of a disease in the throat. He was
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>fully bent on accompanying me to the <span class="">Interior</span> But
<br/>was prevented by the opinions of medical men
<br/>in the colony. As soon as he gets well he intends to 
<br/>come out &amp; strike fair across the country to
<br/>where I am. He is no shilly shallier but a right good<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>hearted Welshman. I hope he will succeed in one
<br/>object he has in view by the Establishment of a
<br/><span class="">Welsh missionary magazine</span> &amp; if so I shall give in
<br/>the <span class="">Rev<span class="sup ">d</span> D. G Watt </span> <span class="">Benares</span> as a contributor to its pages

	

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>Tell me if you object. He has been most successful among
<br/>the <span class="">Hottentots</span> of <span class="">Hankey</span> &amp; I pray be may be still more success<br/>ful amongst the <span class="">inhabitants of the <span class="">Interior</span></span>
<br/>What do you think. I am appointed <span class="">member of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">district committee</span></span> about to be established here and
<br/>this without asking me whether I liked the affair or
<br/>not. A strange world we live in this <span class="">Africa</span>. But we
<br/>shall see. I mean to vote against its coming into the
<br/>world at all &amp; after that give myself not trouble
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>at all about it, for to meet only once a year
<br/>would in this slow travelling country cost me at
<br/>least ⅟₁₂ of my time. How is your <span class="">committee</span>
<br/>organized? <span class="">Inglis</span> &amp; <span class="">Ashton</span> are on their way
<br/>to this place &amp; are designed by the <span class="">directors</span> to
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>go to the <span class="">Interior</span>, they are both intent on obeying
<br/>the command to increase &amp; multiply &amp; replenish the
<br/>earth. Last night I was called up to assist but
<br/>in another way the same laudable undertaking, the night
<br/>before to another &amp; in a day or two I expect to be
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>at a third so you see we are all tending one way
<br/>Please present my very kind regards to <span class="">Budden</span>
<br/>&amp; <span class="">Kennedy</span>. If they become ill they must not
<br/>run away to <span class="">England</span> <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">at once</span>. It will do them good to
<br/>take a look at this outlandish quarter before
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>they go. Poor <span class="">Giles</span> is gone &amp; so is <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Wright</span>
<br/>of <span class="">Phillipolis</span>. May we be enabled to improve 
<br/>by these warning voices. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moore</span> is gone to
<br/><span class="">South Seas</span>. He expected till within a month of
<br/>sailing to come to me. Alas my brother, he wrote
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>me a note which betokened a man in a predicam<br/>-ent Had been married yesterday. All my linen down 
<br/>in the hold &amp; compelled to purchase other today and will
