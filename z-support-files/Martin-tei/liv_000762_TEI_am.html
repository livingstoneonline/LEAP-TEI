<br/>1852</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="">Rev<span class="sup underline ">d</span> W. Thompson</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Sir</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">Having by means of a sound constitution survived
<br/>tedious drawl through the <span class="">Colony</span> I crossed the <span class="">Orange River</span>
<br/>at <span class="">Priestcar</span> - a spot which has been selected for a mission
<br/>station by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Alheit</span> of <span class="">Scheit fontein</span>. The enormous
<br/>weight on my waggon soon after that told on one of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>wheels and down came the elegant Dutch vehicle. The <span class="">African</span>
<br/>coach and ten, on to its marrow bones. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hughs</span> kindly
<br/>lent a wheel and by the assistance of himself and some
<br/>of my old patients I managed to crawl to this place about
<br/>10 days ago. I was sometimes vexed with myself for
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>having loaded up so much but when I reach the places
<br/>where I could offload it gave me sincere pleasure to hand
<br/>the goods to the owners. I was disposed to blame myself
<br/>most when we had to offload at the bottom of acclivities and
<br/>carry the boxes up ourselves. I am now detained here getting
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>my wheel mended.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I had written another <span class="">letter</span> to you and mentioned a number
<br/>of conjectures respecting <span class="">George</span> but his arrival at <span class="">Kuruman</span>
<br/>today renders my surmisings as valuable as conjectures
<br/>usually are. I could not understand what should have
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>prevented him coming up to me on the way and after
<br/>waiting here a week I began to suspect he had got into
<br/>mischief by going to <span class="">Beaufort</span>. He has been at more expense
<br/>than I have - and I had to spend upwards of £50 in the way.
<br/>We shall now help him on. I waited for him as soon as I
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>got a spot which possessed forage, but when he did not turn
<br/>out I concluded he must have taken another road. I
<br/>came here ten days before him.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Now that I can calmly look back on my sojourn among
<br/>the <span class="">natives</span> who live in a hollow under <span class="">Table mountain</span> and
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>who <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: daily">dailly</span> and nightly inhale effluvia known only to the initiated
<br/>in the mysteries of Sanatory reform, I do remember them</p>

	
	<p class="ab ">
<br/>I had a fine <span class="">medical library</span> - and many <span class="">good works on general subjects</span> - the former was my pride &amp; a
<br/>great comfort. I have got lightened - and will move so much more easily now. You will hear of my
<br/>Bakwains yet - they are not broken spirited <span class="">Hottentots</span> that attack sealed many a
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boer's"><span class="">boer</span>'s</span> doom.    
</p>


	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">with feelings of compassion. Poor creatures, living in a state
<br/>of utter respectability - exchanging their <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">how</span> dye do's - their noddings
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: curtsyings">curstyings</span> and ministerial breakfasts and all the while to carnivori
<br/>The <span class="">cannibals</span> I may say of the Law &amp; state &amp; <span class="">Puseyite church</span> ready
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to spring upon them and devour them. They are obliged to live &amp;
<br/>walk as circumspectly as Elephants among well covered pitfalls
<br/>I do pity you from my heart. I could not breathe freely
<br/>till I got over the <span class="">Orange River</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">Well, that is a fine <span class="">letter from his <span class="">Riverence Calderwood</span></span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I look upon it with mingled feelings of scorn and shame. With
<br/>scorn when I think of an English Professor of Christianity so
<br/>unutterably mean as to join in the hue and cry against a
<br/>poor <span class="">Hottentot</span>, and so dead to the shame of infamy as to
<br/>confess at the same time that it has been his practice
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to act the part of a common informer. A salaried
<br/><span class=""><span class="">Government</span> spy</span>.- I blush up to the ears when I
<br/>read his confession (after spending years in the service
<br/>of <span class="">our society</span>) that he does not know the language
<br/>sufficiently well to know exactly the statement of a
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">native</span> without an interpreter. Is it not disgraceful
<br/>to find the <span class="">gospel</span> of <span class="">Christ</span> proclaimed in a <span class="underline ">patois</span>
<br/>called "school <span class="">Caffre</span>"? We must not lose sight of this
<br/>confession. It is good that he makes it though that
<br/>and other statements ought to cover him with lasting
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>infamy. A man who could write as he has done
<br/>will do more. This is not his last letter nor
<br/>his last stab at the cause of truth &amp; righteousness</p>
<br/><p class="p ">You see how the <span class=""><span class="">Government</span> officials</span> feel towards
<br/>the defence of <span class="">Botha</span>. In <span class="">Scotland</span> counsel is provided
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>for the most depraved criminals at the expense of the
<br/><span class="">state</span>. This <span class="">Reverend Commissioner</span> would have us
<br/>believe that such defence "tends to break down important
<br/>moral distinctions" - that its tendency is to cause the
<br/>whole of Scottish society to be suspected for we have
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>criminals there out of every class. From Commissioners
<br/>who can play the fool for £600 per annum with the
<br/><span class="">bible</span> in one hand &amp; the sambok in the other. Good Lord delivers <span class="add  below">us</span></p>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p ">The <span class="">copies of <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Read</span>'s letters</span> have not reached any of the miss-
<br/>ionaries up here.. The <span class="">Reports</span> all did - I have made arrangements
<br/>for the delivery of <span class="">your letters</span>. Have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> two notes from
<br/>you. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span>'s head is still affected. Nothing he has tried
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>has the least effect on it. The <span class="">Translation</span> goes on briskly
<br/>notwithstanding. <span class="">Edwards</span> has left his station and the
<br/>people of <span class="">Mabotsa</span> have come over to <span class="">Sechele</span>. The <span class="">Boers</span> are
<br/>reported by an individual who came here two days ago to be
<br/>encamped at <span class="">Mabotsa</span>. They contemplate rooting out <span class="">Sechele</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and wait only till two or three of their <span class="">party</span> return from the
<br/>Lakes They fear if an attack is made now that <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s people</span>
<br/>fleeing Northwards would meet their friends and of course -
<br/>treat them as they <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">now</span> hope to do the Bakwains. they may find it
<br/>more difficult to subdue <span class="">Sechele</span> than they dream of. But their plan
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>is to secure the whole country to themselves and prevent traders
<br/>and travellers from going beyond them. One of <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span> Robertson</span>'s
<br/>converts called <span class="">Chief commandant Pretorious</span> was <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">feasted</span>
<br/>the other day not far from <span class="">Boomplaats</span> where the battle
<br/>was fought. They drunk the memory of <span class="">Major Hogg</span> in solemn
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>silence but forgot the memory of the brave men who <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 words, cause: hole">[      ]</span>
<br/>butchered at <span class="">Boomplaats</span> by this same <span class="">Pretorius</span>. Is it
<br/>right or is it not for the Bakwains to make the country
<br/>too hot for this man's <span class="">party</span> - after he strikes the first
<br/>blow? I shall be there soon and must give an opinion
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>on the point. What would you advise? If it is right for <span class=""><span class="">Hottentot</span>
<br/>Levies</span> to fight against the <span class="">Caffres</span> it is right for <span class="">Caffres</span> &amp; Bakwains
<br/>to fight against the enemies of their country. I doubt if it is right to fight <span class="add  below">at all</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Ross has gone to see his people again at <span class="">Tauns</span>. He came along</span>
<br/>with me from <span class="">Griqua Town</span> as far as <span class="">Daniel's Kuil</span>. He will  
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>return by way of <span class="">Kuruman</span>. The <span class="">Directors</span> have not written any
<br/>of the bretheren for a long time. <span class="">Major Hogg</span> will have some idea
<br/>now as to whether the <span class="">reports</span> he circulated anent a certain person
<br/>were true or false. We shall all soon be hushed in the still &amp;
<br/>peaceful <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Hades</span>. All this bother &amp; bluster &amp; blarney will <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>a quietus before many years in as far as the present actors
<br/>are concerned. What a hush takes place as the shades of death
<br/>close around one. God grant that when we have finished our
<br/>work we may be hushed to eternal rest on <span class="">Abraham</span>'s bosom</p>

<br/><p class="p ">Kind love to your sister <span class="">Ralph</span> &amp; <span class="">Jessie</span>, I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> mention <span class="">Willie</span>
<br/>because he did not come to help me. I tried your plan on one
<br/>ox and he became a beauty &amp; so tame. All the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> wanted to
<br/>exchange him &amp; poor fellow he was drowned in the <span class="">Orange River</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Three fell into a muddy place on a Saturday evening. We all worked
<br/>the whole night trying to get them out of the sloughy bank and as the
<br/>morning dawned the finest of the whole lot expired. You may guess how
<br/>eagerly we toiled when I mention that when daylight appeared I thought
<br/> was only about 12 o'clock. I have not yet begun to write but have
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>not lost sight of the project. I have not been idle. A correct and lucid
<br/>analysis of the language engages my attention and has taken up all

<br/>my spare time - I have devoted a whole evening to you - your
<br/>notes were good but very short you will someday write a longer
<br/>I hope. Poor <span class="">Botha</span>. The sentence is terrible. It is worse than
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>death. Poor fellow. -- the wicked shall not always triumph
<br/>By same post I send a <span class="">letter for my brother</span> containing <span class="">Sandillah</span>s
<br/>speech to <span class="">Renton</span>. to be printed in <span class="">America</span>. All we learn of
<br/>the <span class="">Caffre</span> war is one sided. We must hear both sides
<br/>It is well <span class="">Sendillah</span> speaks out so nobly. Bringing out converts
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to assist the English is infamous - We must either preach
<br/>passive resistance or fighting for our own <span class="">countrymen</span> <span class="">D. Livingston</span></p>

<br/><span class="">20<span class="sup underline ">th</span></span> You will see by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span>'s to you the doings of <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Robertson</span>'s dearly beloved
<br/>bretheren. I mourn over <span class="">my books</span> &amp; medicines  instruments. Please say nothing
<br/>about my losses or some good Samaritan will forthwith send me odd numbers of
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the <span class="">Evangelical Mag.</span> the pictures extracted - <span class="">"Alleine's Alarm"</span>. without the title page. An odd volume <span class="add  below"><span class="">Charnocks sermons</span> &amp;c</span></p>

<br/>Two <span class="">parties</span> of <span class="">Boers</span> are gone <span class="">Sebitoané</span> wards. they will be cut off <span class="add  above">by <span class=""><span class="">Sechele</span>'s people</span></span>. One of these
<br/><span class="">parties</span> would plunder me if they met me - so I think it well to wait here till
<br/>they are out of my way or killed. It is trying to wait but God's good Providence
<br/>has detained me so long just to prevent me falling into the very worst of the strife &amp; losing <span class="add  below">everything</span></p>
