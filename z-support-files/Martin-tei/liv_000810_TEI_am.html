<br/><p class="p center">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">By a letter dated September last 
<br/>I informed you of my intention to proceed Westward in 
<br/>order to open up a way to the coast. I was then waiting 
<br/>for rains and as these have now commenced I leave 
<br/>this on the 10<span class="sup underline ">th</span> currt. I have altered my mind with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>respect to the route which I intend to try. We sent 
<br/>men to the Westward in order to examine if there is any 
<br/>strip of country free of tsetse in that direction - their 
<br/>report was unfavourable. I then resolved to go on 
<br/>the trail of the Mambari but the <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> merchant</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>signalized his departure by seizing two men and 
<br/>a woman as <span class="">slaves</span>. The Makololo assembeled im- 
<br/>mediately and compelled him to unchain the captives 
<br/>This affair made me alter my resolution <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">again</span> for if I 
<br/>followed his footsteps the different <span class="">tribes</span> through which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>we have to pass would naturally believe me to be 
<br/>of the same <span class="">clan</span>. Indeed knowing what my 
<br/>precursors had done, I should not feel very respectable 
<br/>to myself. I therefore intend going up the river 
<br/><span class="">Leeambye</span> to the point at which we turned in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><span class="">August</span> and then ascend the <span class="">Leeba</span> to the people 
<br/>called Balonda and proceed westward <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">on foot</span>
<br/>by land. The chief has lent me his own canoe 
	
	

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>and as I was unable to take a horse to the <span class="">Barotse
<br/>country</span> on account of the tsetse at this season biting by 
<br/>night as well as by day <span class="">Sekeletu</span> placed four riding oxen 
<br/>at my service, These are now in that country so I hope 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to get on. I go in the canoe from this down the <span class="">Chobe</span>
<br/>to the confluence. Then up the <span class="">Leeambye</span> and <span class="">Leeba</span> till 
<br/>we reach the falls reported to exist on that river. The canoe 
<br/>will be sent back and we must do the best we can 
<br/>beyond. I leave in company with <span class="">Barotse people</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>alone. The people we brought from <span class="">Kuruman</span> have 
<br/>been rendered useless by fever, so I send them 
<br/>back. I am again through God's mercy and kindness 
<br/>quite recovered from the effects of that disease. I 
<br/>think I am getting rid of intermittent too and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>if spared will impart some knowledge of <span class="">Christ</span>
<br/>to many who never before heard his blessed name 
<br/>There are many and very large tribes in the direction 
<br/>in which we go. All are sitting in darkness and 
<br/>the shadow of death. I hope God will in mercy 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>permit me to establish the <span class="">gospel</span> somewhere 
<br/>in this region, and that I may live to see 
<br/>the double influence of the spirit of commerce 
<br/>and Christianity employed to stay the bitter fountain 
<br/>of <span class="">African</span> misery</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><p class="p ">In the <span class="">sketch</span> enclosed in my last I neglected 
<br/>to mention that the ridges noted therein only shew 
<br/>the commencement of lands not usually inundated 
<br/>There are very large tracts of country beyond these which 
<br/>are annually flooded either wholly or partially. The 

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><span class="">Leeambye</span> is not the only source of the waters of inundation 
<br/>the reports of intelligent <span class="">natives</span> lead me to believe that 
<br/>the <span class="">Bashukulompo</span> or <span class="">Maninché</span> river - The <span class="">Loeti</span> - the <span class="">Kabompo</span>
<br/>the <span class="">Makoma</span> and <span class="">Leeambye</span> are all branches, (of one 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>river), leaving and returning to the parent stream in 
<br/>a remarkably level country <span class="figure" title="sketch map including R Zambesi R Chobe R Leeba Loeti Kabompo Makoma R Maninché Londa Barotse Sesheké">{figure}</span>
<br/>this ideal sketch 
<br/>will perhaps enable 
<br/>you to understand 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>my meaning. the 
<br/>dotted lines at the 
<br/>top may be the 
<br/>situation of an immense river or of very numerous 
<br/>branches each pouring out vast quantities of water 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>you will <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: perceive">percieve</span> also that the country is peculiar 
<br/>and will require a modification perhaps of our pla<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: hole">[  ]</span>
<br/>of operation therein. In no other country is ther<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: hole">[ ]</span>
<br/>such a large surface of land annually inundated as 
<br/>in this</p>

<br/>for <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Livingston</span>. It contained full information 
<br/>respecting the visit to the Barotse, this opportunity 
<br/>of transmitting <span class="">letters</span> was unexpected but though I had 
<br/>written fully before I thought it well to let you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>know of the alteration of my plans. and that I

<br/>As <span class="">Sesheké</span> is only about 7 days on foot from the <span class="">Maninché</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>and the falls of <span class="">Mosioatunya</span> may be avoided by sailing down 
<br/>that river into the <span class="">Zambesi</span> this may be a good path down to 
<br/>the <span class="">East Coast</span>. I mention this in case of my being cut off.</p>
