<br/><p class="p center">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 34 chars ">                                                                    </span>Your kind and encouraging letter 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I found a few days ago on returning from another tour in the
<br/><span class="">Interior</span>, and I now beg leave gratefully to acknowledge the
<br/>encouragement it imparted to my mind. It afforded me
<br/>unfeigned pleasure to be informed that the measures I felt it
<br/>my duty to adopt had met the approbation of the <span class="">Directors</span>. Their
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>satisfaction in my labours I hope at all times to feel anxious to
<br/>secure. And I earnestly pray the Great Head of the <span class="">church</span> may
<br/>condescend so to guide my operations, as that all may
<br/>be for His glory. If that prayer is answered I have no
<br/>doubt but that I shall obtain not only the testimony of my
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>own conscience but also the approbation of all His eminent
<br/><span class="">servants</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In reference to two topics adverted to in yours viz.
<br/><span class="">Native</span> agency and the appointment of a <span class="">District Committee</span>
<br/>it will be gratifying for you to be informed that having written
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>some of my <span class="">Christian friends</span> in <span class="">Scotland</span> in behalf of the former
<br/>I have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> some very encouraging promises of support
<br/>One has already remitted the sum of £12 to the <span class="">Society</span>, and
<br/>others promise to make an effort to raise other two
<br/>such sums as soon as the then depressed state of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>country had been got over. But with respect to the
<br/>latter measure I confess I entertain no very sanguine
<br/>hopes of it being successful. I only know of two
<br/>of the bretheren viz. <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Messrs">M<span class="sup ">rs</span></span> <span class="">Moffat</span> &amp; <span class="">Ross</span> at all desirous of its  
<br/>establishment. This and the fact that the others will join
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>simply because such is the expressed will of the <span class="">Directors</span>, 
<br/>seem to <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">augus</span> ill for its prosperity. For my own part
<br/>although a warm admirer of the principles on which the
<br/>congregational unions of <span class="">England</span> and <span class="">Scotland</span> are formed
<br/>my short experience among missionaries makes me not quite
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>so sure of the propriety of missionary unions. the salutary
<br/>influence of enlightened public opinion which these possess
<br/>is here entirely awaiting and without it I believe we may

	

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>in our corporate capacity do what as <span class="">individuals</span> no one of us
<br/>should ever dare. I however endeavour to repress my private
<br/>feelings on the subject And I do so with the hope that the
<br/>measure may be productive of all the advantage to the cause
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>which a well conducted combination is calculated to effect. 
<br/>But the <span class="">Directors</span> will not I trust consider me guilty of
<br/>any impropriety if when yielding a prompt compliance
<br/>with their wish I feel constrained to add I must reserve to
<br/>myself the power of withdrawing from that <span class="">committee</span> if
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>at any future time I feel that to be my duty. If compelled
<br/>to dissolve my connection with it I earnestly hope it may
<br/>not be in consequence of having indulged a spirit inimical
<br/>to brotherly union, but that it may be the result of a
<br/>humble prayerful deliberation and with grief that the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>measure has failed to answer my expectations -- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I shall now endeavour to give you some account of 
<br/>the manner in which I have been e<span class="unclear">m</span>ployed since the date
<br/>of my last viz. <span class="">18 July / 42</span>. And of the prospects still
<br/>before us notwithstanding the commotions wh<span class="unclear">ic</span>h soon
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>after that period arose. No instructions had arrived
<br/>from home and the esteemed bretheren <span class="">Hamilton</span> and
<br/><span class="">Edwards</span> having fully approved of my efforts to <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: benefit">benifit</span>
<br/>the Bakwains I resolved immediately to follow up these
<br/>endeavours in another journey. But when all my
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>arrangements had been completed the sad news were brought
<br/>that <span class="">Sebegwe</span> the chief of the Bangwaketze had contrary to
<br/>the advice I had tendered him last year from the <span class="">Bakwain
<br/>country</span>, left the desert of the <span class="">Bakalahari</span> - that he
<br/>had been attacked by the combined forces of <span class="">Mahura</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>and <span class="">Sehutsane</span>, and that very many of <span class="">his people</span> had
<br/>been murdered. To add to our grief on the reception
<br/>of these news we learned that several of the <span class="">believers</span> of
<br/>this station had been with <span class="">Sebegwe</span> at the very time
<br/>of attack, they being ignorant of the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: treacherous">treachourous</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>designs of their chief had just before assured <span class="">Sebegwe</span>
<br/>that <span class="">Mahura</span> was his friend &amp; ally. The consequence
<br/>was, an impression was produced on the minds of
<br/>both Bangwaketze &amp; other <span class=""><span class="">Interior</span> tribes</span> that the <span class="">believers</span>
<br/>had been the means made use of by <span class="">Mahura</span> for the

	

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>betrayal of <span class="">Sebegwe</span>. Some incidents which happened during
<br/>their visit tended very much to deepen that impression. The
<br/>accidental firing of a musket on the night preceding the attack by
<br/>one of the <span class="">visiting <span class="">party</span></span> was construed as having been the signal by
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>which they apprised <span class="">Mahura</span> of the exact situation of <span class="">Sebegwe</span> --
<br/>The singing at family worhsip as their incantations for success
<br/>And the collecting the people together for worship (it being sabbath morning
<br/>when the attack was made) as only a pretext by which the <span class="">believers</span>
<br/>tried to aid the massacre. On being informed of these untoward
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>events, I felt still more anxious to undertake the journey that
<br/>by my presence and explanations I might endeavour to
<br/>disabuse the minds of the <span class="">Heathen</span> of their prejudices. I feared
<br/>if no effort for that purpose were made the prejudices against
<br/><span class="">our people</span> might become transferred to the <span class="">gospel</span> and thus
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>another barrier be raised against us when we should be permitted
<br/>to carry it to them. But after making every effort I found it
<br/>impossible to procu<span class="unclear">re</span> people for the waggon. All the <span class="">natives</span>
<br/>felt certain that <span class="">Sebegwe</span> revenge himself on the first
<br/><span class="">party</span> from this quarter that fell into his hands. I was therefore
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>compelled to remain in this neighbourhood for several months
<br/>afterwards. This I very much regretted, as the <span class="">population</span> here
<br/>is very small indeed, the majority are professors of religion
<br/>and the remainder being very few there is no scope for more
<br/>than two missionaries at most. The greater portion of
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>my time I employed in itineracy to the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: adjacent">agacent</span> tribes. But when
<br/>here I took part in the routine business of the station, preaching, 
<br/>working occasionally at the printing press, assisting at the
<br/>erection of a small chapel got up by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span> &amp; myself at
<br/>one of the outstations, administering to the wants of the sick  
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>many of whom come great distances for aid, and other duties
<br/>which though differing entirely from those of the minister
<br/>at home all require to be cheerfully performed. To think of
<br/>standing upon what some people at home call "clerical
<br/>dignity" in the sense they have of it, would be as much
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>out of place in a missionary in <span class="">Africa</span> as his becoming
<br/>Entomologist would be. - The work of God has
<br/>been going on steadily here ever since we arrived, 
<br/>but I am not aware of its having <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> any visible impulse
<br/>through our instrumentality. It must therefore be attributed
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>under God entirely to the machinery previously set in motion
<br/>by our honoured <span class="">predecessors</span>. If you could realize this fact

	

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>as fully as those on the spot can, you would be able to enter into
<br/>the feelings of inexpressible delight with which I hail the decision
<br/>of the <span class="">Directors</span> that we go forward to the dark <span class="">Interior</span>. May
<br/>the Lord enable me to consecrate my whole being to the glorious work.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">Most of my period of suspense here was one of great commotion
<br/>in the <span class="">Interior</span>. One tribe or another was attacked either by the
<br/><span class="">Southern tribes</span> or by the more to be dreaded Matibele. These wars
<br/>&amp; rumours of wars seemed to occupy the minds of those under 
<br/>the preaching of the <span class="">gospel</span> to the exclusion of everything else. This
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>proved a great hindrance to the work of conversion. But by
<br/>the month of <span class="">February last</span> the ferment had so far subsided
<br/>I was at length able to find people to conduct the waggon</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I left thus on <span class="">21<span class="sup ">st</span> of February</span> and after 12 days travelling
<br/>arrived at the village where <span class="">Sebegwe</span> with <span class="">the remains of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>his tribe</span> has taken up his residence. One of my men had
<br/>been of the <span class="">party</span> which it was supposed had betrayed him.
<br/>He entered the village along with me and when we arrived at the
<br/>place where <span class="">Sebegwe</span> &amp; his warriors were seated a most
<br/>uproarious recognition of my servant followed. After
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>which I having taken my seat close by <span class="">Sebegwe</span>, he turned to
<br/>me and demanded why I had attacked and destroyed all <span class="">his people</span>. 
<br/>I replied by asking, why he had refused to listen to my advice
<br/>and thus destroy himself. Did the messengers he had sent <span class="unclear">to</span>
<br/>me last year fail to deliver my message or did he discredit
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>my words. Some of the messengers being still alive then
<br/>recognized me and <span class="">Sebegwe</span> &amp; I soon became very good
<br/>friends. He urged in excuse for acting contrary to my advice
<br/>that he was already on his march out of the <span class="">Bakalihari country</span> 
<br/>when his messengers returned. That he was most desirous
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>again to eat corn. - That great numbers of <span class="">his
<br/>people</span> had been cut off by a fever which prevails near
<br/>the <span class="">Lake Mokhoro</span> - And that being entirely ignorant of
<br/>the power of guns he despised the Batlapi as antagonists. 
<br/>The meaning of the comet which was then visible to us
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>in all its splendour was his next enquiry. He, like all
<br/>the tribes which I visited, thought that it was indicative
<br/>of the approach of some dreadful calamity. Perhaps it
<br/>was significant of the death of <span class="">Mahura</span> which he had been
<br/>trying to bring about by means of witchcraft. Or it might be

	

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>an intimation of another inroad of the Matibele as they had seen a
<br/>comet just before their first invasion." I tried to convince him 
<br/>that there was no calamity permitted to befall man except by the
<br/>will of God and that for some object of good to those who experienced
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>it. But the mind of poor <span class="">Sebegwe</span> is on these subjects as dark as
<br/>midnight. He however during the whole of our visit behaved
<br/>in a most friendly way. It being Saturday when I arrived I
<br/>explained the nature of the Sabbath and requested an opportunity
<br/>to address <span class="">his people</span>. Next morning before daybreak I was 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>much pleased to hear a herald proclaiming that by the orders
<br/>of the chief "nothing should be done on that day but praying
<br/>to God and listening to the words of the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: foreigner">foriegner</span>" He himself
<br/>listened with great attention when I told them of "<span class="">Jesus</span> and the
<br/>resurrection" and I was not unfrequently interrupted by him
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>putting sensible questions on the subject. He told me that
<br/>he once saw <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> but as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> M.</span> was young and did
<br/>not know the language it is not remarkable that <span class="">Sebegwe</span> had
<br/>forgotten all that had been said. May the Holy Spirit be poured
<br/>down upon him for without his gracious influences nothing
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>that we can do will penetrate the thick crest of ignorance 
<br/>which <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: envelops">envelopes</span> their benighted souls -- </p>
<br/><p class="p ">After remaining a few days with <span class="">Sebegwe</span> and partaking of
<br/>such hospitality as his reduced circumstances now enable
<br/>him to bestow I passed on to the Bakhatla who live a few
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>hours to the Northwest. Their situation is peculiarly well
<br/>adapted for missionary operations, more so indeed than any
<br/>I have seen in this country. There is as great a <span class="">population</span>
<br/>collected in one spot as in any other point in the <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>and that <span class="">population</span> seems attached to the soil - There are
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>abundant facilities for a more improved mode of agri-
<br/>-culture even should that be adopted by a much more
<br/>numerous <span class="">population</span> than at present exists. The manufactory
<br/>of iron seems to have been carried on here <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: uninterruptedly">uninteruptedly</span>
<br/>from a very remote period. The ore is found at
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>the junction of the <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Trappean</span> &amp; sandstone rocks in the
<br/>immediate vicinity of the villages, and is scarcely any-
<br/>where covered by any depth of soil. It was very
<br/>near to this spot where <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span> faced about to
<br/>go home and very probably the iron founderies which he

	

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>heard of but was not permitted to see are the very same as belong to
<br/>them. They always refuse admittance to those who have had intercourse
<br/>with the other sex since the period of the year when they annually
<br/>commence smelting lest they should bewitch the iron. Which
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>is probably the very same reason which prevented <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span>
<br/>a sight of them. Iron bewitched is when it is burned to a 
<br/>cinder from a too brisk use of the bellows. When the chief &amp;
<br/>principal families of the tribe fled along with <span class="">Sebegwe</span> on account
<br/>of the inroads of the Matibele the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: majority">magority</span> of the tribe remained
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and carried on their works in iron as usual. The nature
<br/>of the soil too is different from that at <span class="">Kuruman</span> and it
<br/>is probable we should not be mortified as here by the frequent
<br/>removals of the people on account of the deaths of their cattle
<br/>And as they are situated near several other tribes the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>difficulties of itineracy and <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: superintendence">superintendance</span> of <span class="">native</span> agents
<br/>among them would not be very formidable. I lately asked
<br/>the chief of that tribe if he should like me to come and be
<br/>his missionary <span class="unclear">He</span> held up his hands &amp; said "O I shall dance
<br/>for joy if you do" I shall collect all <span class="">my people</span> to hoe for
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>you a garden and you will get more sweet reed &amp; corn than
<br/>myself" No instructions on the subject of an <span class="">Interior</span>
<br/>mission having then come to hand I could only say in
<br/>answer to his enquiries, that I should inform my Christian
<br/>friends in <span class="">England</span> of his desires for a missionary. I
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>need scarcely add that his wish although sincere does not
<br/>indicate any love to the doctrines we teach. It is merely
<br/>a desire for the protection &amp; temporal benefit which
<br/>missionaries are everywhere supposed to bring. It is
<br/>however as much as we can expect from the
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="">Heathen</span>. If we have security for life &amp; property
<br/>we trust the Lord will give us in his own time
<br/>all the rest our hearts long for.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The <span class="">village of <span class="">Sechele</span></span> the chief of the Bakwain is five
<br/>days beyond the Bakhatla. Last year he was exasperated
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>with me for remaining a month with <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">Bube</span></span> another Bakwain
<br/>chief whom <span class="">Sechele</span> considers as in rebellion against
<br/>him. <span class="unclear">He</span> made known to some of the <span class="">believers</span> of this
<br/>station his determination to do me mischief should

	

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>I ever attempt to pass his country again. But the Lord was
<br/>my shield and <span class="">Sechele</span> was kinder than I ever saw him before
<br/>His only child was sick when I arrived and the child of one of
<br/><span class="">his principal men</span> was red<span class="unclear">uc</span>ed to a skeleton by dysentery. The
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>means I employed were with the Divine blessing useful to both
<br/>and <span class="">Sechele</span> did not seem able to speak a single angry word.
<br/>We had much private conversation together in the course of which
<br/>he told me all his objections to the <span class="">gospel</span> we preach. Several
<br/>of his questions were striking. One was "since it is true
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that all who die unforgiven are lost forever, Why did your nation
<br/><span class="addmargin"> [not] </span> come to tell us of it before now"? My ancestors are all gone
<br/>&amp; none of them knew anything of what you tell me. How is this?
<br/>(I thought immediately of the guilt of the church but did not
<br/>confess.) I told him multitudes in our own country were
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>like himself so much in love with <span class="unclear">their</span> sins my
<br/>ancestors had spent a great deal of time in trying to per-
<br/>-suade them And yet after all many of them by refusing
<br/>were lost. We now wish to tell all the world about
<br/>a saviour And if men did not believe the guilt would
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>be entirely theirs. <span class="">Sechele</span> has been driven to another
<br/>part of his country from that in which he was located
<br/>last year. And so has <span class="">Bube</span> so the prospects I had
<br/>last year of benefitting them by <span class="">native</span> teachers are
<br/>for the present darkened. It is painful to see it
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>But we must not be discouraged. If we only do our
<br/>duty in an energetic hearty way the Most High will
<br/>surely lift upon us the light of His countenance &amp;
<br/>bless us.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The Matibele of <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> during their last
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>inroad upon the tribes in the <span class="">Interior</span> took many of
<br/>the women prisoners. These are constantly making their
<br/>escape &amp; returning to their respective tribes. When
<br/>still at the <span class="">town of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sechele">Sehele</span></span></span> I saw a <span class="">party</span> of these fugitives
<br/>which had just arrived. They had travelled nearly two
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>months from the period of making their escape, collect<br/>-ing the roots of the desert for subsistence by day
<br/>and climbing any high rock they saw in their way
<br/>for protection by night. The hardships they had
<br/>undergone reduced them almost to skeletons and
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>it was most affecting to listen to their tale of woe 

	

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>But on the part of their fellow countrymen the recital of their sufferings
<br/>seemed <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">to</span> excite not the smallest sympathy. They were "women only" and
<br/>the men sat &amp; listened with the greatest indifference Truly Heathenism
<br/>has no <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">bowels</span> of compassion. The tale of these females although
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>it had no effect on the Bakwains, had a powerful effect upon the
<br/>people of my waggon. I could not prevail upon them to go an inch
<br/>further for to go any nearer the Matibele than they were seemed
<br/>like rushing into the jaws of death. Their very hearts seemed
<br/>ready to die within them. I was thus reduced to the necessity
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of either giving up my tour &amp; returning, or going forward on
<br/>oxback. I chose the latter and although it has some
<br/>inconveniences, it possesses some advantages over the
<br/>waggon. I visited no fewer than four <span class="">villages of the 
<br/>Bakalihari</span> to which with the waggon I could not have
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>come. And as they are much more attentive to our instructions
<br/>than any other Bechuana tribe the pleasure of proclaiming
<br/>the message of mercy <span class="unclear">to</span> those who had never before
<br/>seen a white face, far outweighed any fatigue incurred
<br/>in reaching them. <span class="unclear">By</span> far the happiest portion of my 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>late journey was when sitting by their fires &amp; listening to
<br/>their traditionary tales I could intermingle the story of the
<br/>cross with their conversation. They are a poor degraded
<br/><span class="">enslaved people</span>. The other tribes consider them as their
<br/>inferiors - keep them constantly hunting for them and
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>although they procure all the skins which the other tribes
<br/>sew into Karosses they can scarcely keep as many as 
<br/>cover their own nakedness - their gardens are always
<br/>situated far from their villages in order to secure the
<br/>produce from the exactions of their masters. And they
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>are always found far from water in order to get as few
<br/>visits from the servants of the chiefs as possible. To us
<br/><span class="">Europeans</span> it is wonderful how they live. But though they
<br/>are in want of much that we consider almost necessary
<br/>to existence a kind Providence has supplied them with
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>many substitutes, they have shewn me more than 40
<br/>different kinds of roots and above 30 kinds of fruits which
<br/>the desert spontaneously yields them. And many of these are
<br/>by no means unsavoury <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">esculents</span>, "Locusts and wild
<br/>honey" abound to them. Perhaps I may be excused if I mention
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>the physiological effects of <span class="">the Baptist</span>'s food, the former 
<br/>is excessively constipating and the latter has quite the opposite
<br/>tendency. The locusts pounded &amp; mixed with honey are as good

	

	<span class="pb-title">0009</span>
<br/>if not better than shrimps at home. It is not probable that he confined
<br/>himself to that diet. If however "locusts and wild honey" were as plentiful
<br/>in the wilderness of <span class="">Judea</span> as they are now in the <span class="">desert of the
<br/>Bakalihari</span> he would have had very little difficulty in finding a constant
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>supply. During a period of twelve months I saw no fewer than
<br/>nineteen swarms of locusts and yet no particular damage was
<br/>done to the crops of the <span class="">natives</span> in consequence; and had I myself
<br/>attended all the calls of the "honey bird" I should never have been
<br/>without a sufficiency of honey.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">When at the Bamangwato I saw a son of <span class="">Conrad Buys</span>, a name
<br/>both known and dreaded by the early missionaries. He is apparently
<br/>about 30 years of age. - is dressed &amp; speaks the language exactly as
<br/>the <span class="">native</span>. He is one of their lowest menials &amp; is kept to tend a garden
<br/>in a sort of <span class="">slavery</span>. His father, <span class="">Buys</span> after committing many
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>acts of injustice &amp; murder among the more southern tribes proceeded
<br/>to the <span class="">North East of the Bamangwato</span> and there fell a victim to
<br/>fever. The <span class="">natives</span> took possessi<span class="unclear">on</span> of everything belonging to him
<br/>Even his children of <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">whom</span> by different <span class="">native</span> wives he had seven, the
<br/>different chiefs took and distributed among their servants
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>This man had been given by a former chief of the Bamangwato
<br/>to his present master, two brothers he informed me are still
<br/>alive but in <span class="">servitude</span> to another tribe. He has forgot all
<br/>about God &amp; <span class="">Jesus</span> &amp; only remembers that his father sometimes
<br/>collected his children - read a book, and then knelt down to pray. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>He does not remember a single word of Dutch although I tried 
<br/>to recall it to his memory by frequently addressing him in that
<br/>language. His owner would not consent to part with him
<br/>so I was obliged to leave him in his sad position. And I could
<br/>not help thinking that the passage "the seed of evil doers
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>shall never be renowned" has found in him something like
<br/>a fulfillment</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Both Bamangwato, Bakaa &amp; Makalaka have been
<br/>visited during the last year by the <span class="">commandoes of <span class="">Mosilikatze</span></span>
<br/>and they are all in a much more impoverished condition than
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>when I saw them last. The caverns of the Bakaa &amp; Makalaka
<br/>saved their lives; their property has all been carried off
<br/>The Bamangwato in addition to the loss of property have been consid<br/>-erably reduced in numbers in consequence of having been

<br/>too, during which the chief killed his own brother have tended to the same
<br/>result - </p>
<br/><p class="p ">During my last visit to the Bakaa a <span class="">native</span> who accompanied me
<br/>was seized with fever just before we entered their village. A report
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>was afterwards circulated that he had been poisoned by the people
<br/>This year they seem determined all cause for such an
<br/>imputation for during my three days sojourn with them they gave
<br/>me nothing but a little sweet reed and a few watermelons. These
<br/>were very good but my Bakwains (of whom I had three <span class="">my own
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>people</span> being left with the waggon) said it was only a little water
<br/>&amp; complained bitterly of hunger. I felt it too but I had reason
<br/>to be thankful for their stinginess. For when returning down
<br/>their lofty rocks to our sleeping place below I was so interested
<br/>in the questions they were putting concerning the subject on which
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I had just addressed them I forgot for a moment the dangers of
<br/>the path I was descending. Presently however feeling as if falling
<br/>down the precipice I made a violent effort to save myself
<br/>but in doing so struck my hand against a sharp fragment
<br/>of the rock And the <span class="">testament</span> being in that hand <span class="unclear">it</span> served as
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a point of resistance between which &amp; the rock a finger
<br/>suffered compound fracture. I got a good splint made of a
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: piece">peice</span> of sweet reed. My involuntary low diet saved me from
<br/>irritative fever and though I did not rest a day in consequence
<br/>of the accident it proceeded to heal kindly. One night however
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>a lion of which there are very many in that country came very
<br/>near to the bush where we were all sound asleep &amp; then
<br/>suddenly commenced his hideous roaring. - my ox leaped in
<br/>among us - the poor Bakwains shrieked for fear and
<br/>I half asleep and stupid seized a pistol with the disabled
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>hand, fired but the rebound hurt me more than the shot did
<br/>the lion. - it rebroke my bone. The Bakwains, who were
<br/>most attentive to my wants during the whole journey of more
<br/>than 400 miles, tried to comfort me when they saw the
<br/>blood again running by saying "You have hurt
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>yourself, but you have redeemed us, Henceforth we will
<br/>swear only by you." Poor creatures I wished they had
<br/>felt gratitude for the blood which was shed for their
<br/>precious souls. The second edition of the fracture was
<br/>worse than the first but as I can bear a little pain, it was

	

	<span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<br/>not nearly so great a hindrance as you may imagine and it is
<br/>now nearly well. The Lord has been exceedingly kind to me. He
<br/>has shielded me in many such dangers. May my heart be
<br/>stirred up to love Him more ardently and may his name be
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>blessed for ever and ever.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I might have proceeded further into the <span class="">Interior</span> but as I
<br/>was more than 200 miles north from the waggon and the
<br/>people of it not very trustworthy, I deemed it more prudent
<br/>to return. The only new people I saw besides the Bakalihari
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>were <span class="">a portion of the race of Makalaka</span>. They live much
<br/>farther <span class="">North</span> than the other <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">portion</span> <span class="add  above">tribe</span> mentioned above and are
<br/>within 2 days of <span class="">Mosilikatze</span>. They assured me that that
<br/>Tyrant was still alive and still pursues his career of blood
<br/>In returning I walked over what was once the site of <span class="">his
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Town</span> near <span class="">Mosiga</span> and where he suffered his last dreadful
<br/>defeat by a handful of <span class="">Boors</span>. The grass had recently been
<br/>burned off the country so I got a good view of the whole
<br/>and a few human bones were all that remained of what
<br/>once belonged to the marauder. And these will soon
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>be removed for the hyaenas are so plentiful in a few years
<br/>they remove everything by which one could discover a recent field
<br/>of slaughter. <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> is living at the distance of 12 days
<br/>or about 200 miles <span class="">North East of the Bamangwato</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">To one other topic I feel compelled after a long &amp; painful delibera<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>-tion explicitly to advert, and while I do so I feel tremblingly alive
<br/>to the responsibility which a statement in anyway calculated to
<br/>influence the decisions of the <span class="">Directors</span>, necessarily involves. Every
<br/>time I have the thought of the duty of making known my convictions
<br/>my heart has palpitated with fear. But now when I hear of
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the glorious prospects opened up for missionary enterprise in
<br/><span class="">China</span> the dread of unfaithfulness overcomes the fear of <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">unfaith</span>
<br/>misleading you. I feel consolation however in making known
<br/>what I consider to be the pec<span class="unclear">u</span>liarities of this part of the world in 
<br/>the belief that you do not act in consequence of the convictions
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>of a single mind, but from the knowledge derived from the
<br/>sentiments of <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">all</span> your other agents in the country. The conviction
<br/>to which I refer is that a much larger share of the benevolence
<br/>of the <span class="">Church</span> and of missionary exertion is directed into
<br/>this country than the amount of population as compared with
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>other countries, and the success attending those efforts seem
<br/>to call for. This conviction has been forced upon me

	

	<span class="pb-title">0012</span>
<br/>both by a personal inspection more extensive than that which has
<br/>fallen to the lot of any other either missionary or trader and by the
<br/>sentiments of other missionaries who have investigated the subject acc<br/>-ording to their opportunites. In reference to the population I
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>may mention that I was led in <span class="">England</span> to believe that the pop<br/>-ulation of the <span class="">Interior</span> was dense &amp; now since I have come 
<br/>I have conversed with many both of <span class="">our society</span>
<br/>&amp; of the French &amp; none of them could <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">reckon</span> up the number of 
<br/>thirty thousand Bechuanas. But lest I should mislead I shall
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>give the number of huts in each of the Towns not yet
<br/>under the immediate influence of missionaries. I do so
<br/>not with the hope that you will take my estimate as <span class="underline ">the</span>
<br/><span class="underline ">truth</span> but with the wish that it may lead to a call for
<br/>statistical information before any other missionaries are sent
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>here. If it is thought proper to accede to this wish &amp; correct
<br/>returns made I am confident the estimate I give below will be
<br/>over not under the mark - My confidence arises from the
<br/>following reasons. In every instance I give a larger number
<br/>of huts than actually exist in order to obviate the possibility 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>of mistake in counting. - A large proportion of the huts
<br/>are store houses &amp; not inhabited by any one - there are usually
<br/>one of these to the hut of every wife - And there are others appro-
<br/>-priated as dormitories for the growing up daughters of families - 
<br/>And the usual mode of re<span class="unclear">c</span>koning five to a family ought not
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to be adopted where as in <span class="">heathen</span> towns polygamy so extensive<br/>-ly prevails, very many have two wives, others have four
<br/>some six &amp; others such as chiefs seven. Now each of these wives
<br/>has her own hut &amp; store but for preserving corn &amp;c. And
<br/>this state of things operates most injuriously against the
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>increase of children. The advantage which <span class="">Christianity</span> has
<br/>over <span class="">heathenism</span> in this respect is already quite apparent
<br/>in villages where the former has been adopted. On these grounds
<br/>I apprehend we ought not to apply the <span class="">European</span> mode of
<br/>computation here. Two or at most three to a hut is all
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>that can be given.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I begin with <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Taons</span></span> the chief residence of the Batlapi
<br/>because although very near to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Helmore</span> &amp; frequently visited
<br/>by him it is compared to other parts destitute of the <span class="">gospel</span>
<br/>and it is one of the largest collections of population in the
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>country Huts 480 last year; but it has <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> by the arrival
<br/>of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Sehitsane</span></span> there this year about 150 more. Near to <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Taons</span></span>

	<span class="pb-title">0013</span>
<br/>there is another section of the Batlapi under a chief called
<br/><span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Motlabam</span></span>. Huts 770 To which for those engaged in tending the
<br/>cattle of the tribe we may add 200 more. The whole of this
<br/>population being situated in a valley can be seen at one
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>view And to us who are more accustomed to see the dreary
<br/>wilderness than the pleasant <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">harvests</span> of men. Their
<br/>number seems prodigously large. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Owen</span> of the
<br/><span class="">Church Missionary Society</span> thought there were at least
<br/>20,000 souls at <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Taons</span></span> But had he adopted some method
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of enumeration his estimate would have been less than
<br/>half that number. Such as it is however. What a mass
<br/>of precious immortals is congregated there. And how sad
<br/>it is to think of their state. They have fled from the
<br/><span class="">gospel</span> and are to a man its bitter opponents - </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><p class="p ">The Bahurutse another tribe in that direction numbers 800
<br/>huts But no settlement could be made with them for though
<br/>friendly to missionaries they live in a most unsuitable locality
<br/>and are constantly longing to depart from it. Their own
<br/>country is in the neighbourhood of the Bakhatla and there is
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>every probability they will return to it as soon as they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span>

<br/>The Bakaa 250 - The Makalaka 200 - </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I do not take into the account the <span class="">villages of the Bakalihari</span> as
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>they were all small and cannot be given as anything like an
<br/>approximation to the number of the tribe. The other section of
<br/>the Makalaka I had no opportunity of estimating. The sum total
<br/>of the others is 5750 which we may call 6000, and applying
<br/>the <span class="">European</span> average we have only 30 000 as the highest
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>possible estimate. This is however much over the real
<br/>population. Indeed I question if there are twenty thousand Bechuanas
<br/>within the sphere of <span class="">our society</span>'s operations. Certainly there are
<br/>not forty thousand on the side of this 21<span class="sup ">st</span> degree of the South
<br/>Latitude unless we include those under the French &amp; Wesleyan 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>missionaries to the <span class="">Eastward</span>. Now for this comparatively
<br/>small population we have no fewer than 12 missionaries
<br/>&amp; their wives. In this I include the two bretheren at <span class="">Moteeto</span>
<br/>Also <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Schreiner</span> and one of the bretheren at <span class="">Griqua Town</span> as
<br/>Bechuana Missionaries</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p ">In view of these facts and the confirmation of them I have
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> from both French &amp; English bretheren computing the
<br/>population much below what I have stated I confess I feel
<br/>grieved to hear of the arrival of new missionaries. Nor
<br/>Am I the only one who deplores their appointment to this
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>country. Again &amp; again have I been pained at heart to 
<br/>hear the question put. Where will these new bretheren
<br/>find fields of labour in this country? Because I
<br/>know that in <span class="">India</span> &amp; <span class="">China</span> there are fields large
<br/>enough for all their energies - I am very far
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>from undervaluing the success which has attended
<br/>the labours of missionaries in this land. No, I
<br/>gratefully acknowledge the wonders God hath wrought
<br/>and I feel that the salvation of one soul is of
<br/>more value than all the effort that has here been
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>expended. But we are to seek the field where there
<br/>is a probability most souls will be converted and

	

	<span class="pb-title">0015</span>
<br/>it is this consideration which makes me earnestly call the
<br/>attention of the <span class="">Directors</span> to the subject of statistics. If these
<br/>were accurately returned and there would be very little difficulty
<br/>in doing so. (An individual could take a census counting each
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of the population personally in such villages as this in the course
<br/>of a single day &amp; the largest in this country would require
<br/>very little more time) It might perhaps be found that there
<br/>is not a country better supplied with missionaries <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">than any
<br/>other</span> in the world. and that in proportion to the number
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of agents compared to the amount of population the success
<br/>may be inferior to most other countries where efforts have been
<br/>made</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Well supplied as the country is it bears no comparison
<br/>to the <span class="">Colony</span>. There the number of missionaries of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>different societies is so large compared to the population
<br/>it must strike every one with astonishment. <span class="">Algoa
<br/>Bay</span> for instance or <span class="">Colesberg</span>, villages not larger
<br/>than <span class="">Ongar</span> which is I believe the smallest market
<br/>town in <span class="">England</span> have each the <span class="">gospel</span> preached by three
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Evangelical</span> ministers. And each of them feels convinced
<br/>that he has a very large &amp; very important field of 
<br/>labour. <span class="underline ">They do believe it</span>. But in what way they
<br/>have come to the belief I could not ascertain.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">In conclusion I beg leave to say whatever may be
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the views of the <span class="">Directors</span> on this portion of my commun<br/>-ication I feel immensely relieved by making the statement 
<br/>I feel a load taken off my heart. And may the Lord 
<br/>in mercy guide them to the view of the subject which
<br/>will tend most to His glory. I must also state
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>that I have since hearing of the delightful prospects opened
<br/>in <span class="">China</span> felt again the glowings of heart towards that
<br/>country which were familiar to my mind when I dedicated
<br/>myself to the mission work there. I feel it is wrong to
<br/>think more of another field than that to which in the
