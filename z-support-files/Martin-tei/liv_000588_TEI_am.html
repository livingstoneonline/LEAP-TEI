<br/><p class="p ">We have enclosed thoughts on
<br/><span class="">Helen</span>'s affair. We think the young
<br/>man did right in speaking to <span class="">Helen</span> first

<br/>come to you first for the world
<br/>It may be well for her future
<br/>prosperity if she is directed past

<br/>he would get to the <span class="">Colony</span> first, perhaps  
<br/>this statement may be included in the
