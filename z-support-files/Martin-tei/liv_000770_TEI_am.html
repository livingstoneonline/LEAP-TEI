<br/>My Dear Sir
<br/>Enclosed you will <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: perceive">percieve</span> <span class="">a letter</span> which
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I have ventured to address to the <span class="">Lieutenant Governor</span>
<br/>I have endeavoured to give a plain outline of the
<br/>facts and merely hinted at the possible consequences
<br/>and now if the <span class="">Government</span> goes on heedlessly
<br/>the blame will rest on its own shoulders. I enclose
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it to you because I understand you are expected
<br/>to be our go between in all matters pertaining to the 
<br/><span class="">Government</span>. The reason which I feel the chief one
<br/>in my mind for troubling you is that you may
<br/>reverse your judgement on it whether it ought to be
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>delivered at all － From it and <span class=""><span class="">Mr Moffat</span>'s letter</span>
<br/>you will have a pretty clear idea of the doings of
<br/><span class=""><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Robertson</span>'s converts</span> - and may fancy that reverend
<br/>sinner turning up the white of his eyes and saying to 
<br/>them at the communion table "Eat O friends! drink, yea
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>drink abundantly O beloved" － they went the whole hog
<br/>attended church on Sunday hearing <span class="">Mebaloe</span> preach and  
<br/>then made the parson flee for his life on Monday
<br/>he ran the gauntlet some of them calling out when
<br/>they saw him with clothes on there is the chief &amp;
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>then the bullets whistled over behind &amp; before him
<br/>he seems to have become terrified － ran through 
<br/>the midst of the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> &amp; so fast his feet were
<br/>dreadfully bruised － He has lost all he had － viz
<br/>27 head of cattle &amp; his furniture &amp;c his house was
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>burned by the <span class=""><span class="underline ">Christians</span></span>. He it was who stood by
<br/>me when bitten by the lion &amp; got bit himself － He
<br/>has been with me ever since I came into the country</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">but I fear this will be a settler for him － he is now on
<br/>his way out here. Some fine young men whom I
<br/>knew and loved have fallen － My heart is sore when
<br/>I think of them － <span class="">Sechele</span> had two bullets through his hat
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and a third through his coat sleeve － the <span class="">Boers</span> have
<br/>lost one of their principal men － I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know his
<br/>name － The chief with whom <span class="">Inglis</span> lives is heart &amp;
<br/>soul with the <span class="">Boers</span>. He ought to leave. He has informed
<br/><span class="">Solomon</span> that he is going to the <span class="">Cape</span> in order to send
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>his wife and children to <span class="">England</span> <span class="add  above">not of course in imitation of me</span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Edwards</span> sends
<br/>her children to <span class="">Walthamstow</span> school. If you ask
<br/>the opinion of the <span class="">Directors</span> you will find that they
<br/>would like <span class="">Inglis</span> to come home too and there would 
<br/>be little doubt but that he would remain there
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>You may wonder what will be the end of all this
<br/>and you may perhaps wonder still more if I venture to
<br/>say that I see nothing in it all unfavourable to the
<br/>progress of the kingdom of <span class="">Christ</span> － There is evidently
<br/>a process in operation in the whole of <span class="">South Africa</span> －
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>and there soon will appear another wonderful develop
<br/>-ment of this Providence who is wonderful in counsel
<br/>&amp; excellent in working. In every district of the country 
<br/>the process tends the same way － We "poor renegades from
<br/>the anvil and loom" long insisted that the <span class="">Hottentots</span> had
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>souls and our statements were looked upon as the blarney
<br/>of silly enthusiasm, A few hundred of them however
<br/>take it into their monkey heads to rebel and they actually
<br/>kick the ossa coccyges of our dragoons and <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">minié</span>
<br/>rifle men － No wonder that great was the wrath
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>of the <span class=""><span class="">Gov<span class="sup underline ">t</span></span> Officials</span> － <span class="">Hottentot</span> rebellion! what next. We may
<br/>expect our cats to have a strike "cause missus <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> give
<br/>us the silver forks to eat with" － If we had hinted at a
<br/><span class="">Hottentot</span> rebellion I believe they would have believed
<br/>that a cow could handle a musket as well as they － The
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Rebellion is however a great fact and the con-
    
	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>demnation of <span class="">Botha</span> has sown seed which will yet vegetate
<br/>But I am away from my <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">text</span> － Everywhere there is a strong
<br/>feeling of <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: independence">independance</span> springing up － The English as a nation
<br/>have lost character &amp; honour － the destruction of my property
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>is a fortunate thing for me. there is not a <span class="">native</span> in the country 
<br/>but knows now for certain on whose side I am. The <span class="">Boers</span>
<br/>in plundering my house often expressed great regret that they
<br/>had not got a hold of me. But we shall yet catch him said
<br/>they. How good God's Providence is to me. I was detained in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Cape Town</span> till I quite fretted and then again in the way up －
<br/>But now I can plainly see that had I got my own
<br/>way I should have been in the very thick of the fight for
<br/>I always intended to spend a fortnight or so with the Bakwains
<br/>I grieve over the losses they have sustained but there is another
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>point of view in which the matter may considered. the majority
<br/>of the Bakwains have heard the <span class="">gospel</span> repeatedly but have not
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> it. They treated me uniformly with respect but when
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> professed faith in <span class="">Christ</span> they persecuted him bitterly － the
<br/>Bakhatla have not only long refused to listen even but treated <span class=""> M<span class="sup ">r</span> Edwards</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>with great disrespect － Nearly £1000 has been spent on them in vain
<br/>indeed their p<span class="add  above">r</span>ofessed principles were to get all out of the missionary
<br/>they could but never <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receive">recieve</span> his message － the same may be
<br/>said of the Bahurutse and although the two stations are broken up
<br/>it is no cause for sorrow. The Bakwains I am informed
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>attended both school &amp; church better after I left for the <span class="">Cape</span> than
<br/>for a long time previously － average of the school 80. <span class="">Sechele</span>'s
<br/>children are out here living with <span class="">Mr<span class="sup ">s</span> Moffat</span> they are well behaved
<br/>the son resembles his father in manners. They give much less
<br/>trouble than was expected － I think the seed sown will yet spring 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>up among the Bakwains though I may not live to see it － I am 
<br/>at present prevented from leaving for my own country by
<br/>two <span class="">parties of <span class="">Boers</span></span> who are now in the <span class="">North</span> and are
<br/>to be cut off. If I attempted to serve them they would very
<br/>probably rob me in return, so must stand their chance
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span><span class="">Sechele</span> sends a message to me to wait a little yet so though
<br/>it is trying to wait when free &amp; all ready for work, I must
<br/>submit － I have just been driven away from <span class="">my writing</span></p>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/><p class="p ">by the chief <span class="">Mahura</span> － he is here on a visit － a great rogue
<br/>he made a remark worth noting- "<span class="">Sebube</span> and <span class="">Paul</span> and you were
<br/>taken out of the way of being killed - If either of you had been there
<br/>you would certainly have been in the midst of the affair &amp; been killed
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>God helped you by sending you out of the way" <span class="">Sebube</span> and <span class="">Paul</span>
<br/>are gone north. <span class="">Sebube</span> is a very brave fellow － <span class="">Native</span> teacher
<br/>to the Wanketse － He has lost all, though <span class="">Mahura</span> is a <span class="">heathen</span>
<br/>he has imbibed some Christian knowledge － I have been thinking
<br/>that I might draw £12 for <span class="">Mebaloe</span> － I have drawn nothing
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>for some time for either him or <span class="">Paul</span>, our operations have 
<br/>been interrupted － but as it is a matter of business I shall
<br/>write you if I do. No word from my better half yet</p>
