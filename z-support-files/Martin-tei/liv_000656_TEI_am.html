<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>a comparative anatomist I could only look at it

<br/>I might have lost ten as <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ross</span> did. and any harshness 
<br/>on my part might have had a bad effect on his &amp; other

<br/>I have some horns for you - I missed the opportunity
