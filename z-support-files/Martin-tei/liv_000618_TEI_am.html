<br/><p class="p left">My Dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As we are in daily expectation of the 
<br/>arrival of your better half we feel as if the worse 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>did not deserve a letter ᅳ This is plain enough is it 
<br/>not? It is perhaps rather a sort of nervousness 
<br/>produced by stretching our necks frequently to 
<br/>see if the waggon is in sight that quite indisposes 
<br/>us to write. We wish heartily she would come 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>&amp; relieve our suspense May be after all she 
<br/>is snugly at supper giving the meat two 
<br/>taps with her knife before she cuts it by way 
<br/>of <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">alagaing</span> it to make it more digestible</p>
<br/><p class="p ">A <span class="">report</span> furnished by <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Lauga</span> respecting 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the <span class="">party of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Arkwright</span> &amp; <span class="">Christie</span></span> made us 
<br/>think a little. We saw nothing improper in 
<br/>their conduct while proceeding Northward and 
<br/>now that <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> A.</span> returns We have neither seen 
<br/>nor heard anything which induces us to believe 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> L.</span>'s <span class="">report</span> as having originated in him 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> A.</span> has been here three days &amp; neither he nor 
<br/><span class="">his people</span> have shewn any disposition towards 
<br/>illicit intercourse. He is the son of a clergyman</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><p class="p ">&amp; if there is truth in what <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> L.</span> mentioned it must 
<br/>have been perpetrated by <span class="">Christie</span> &amp; not by <span class="">Arkwright</span>
<br/>the latter I believe abstains from traveling on 
<br/>Sunday in accordance with a request of <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Ashton</span> and if he has so much respect for 
<br/>a missionary as to accede in one particular 
<br/>he surely would not be guilty attempting to take 
<br/>a prostitute into <span class="">his company</span> a deed he knows 
<br/>would soon be published over the whole 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>country. We have found him <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: agreeable">agreable</span> &amp; kind 
<br/>&amp; he has during his whole sojourn here behaved 
<br/>like a gentleman I say this much because 
<br/>I feel it would be unfair to condemn any one 
<br/>unless the evidence is pretty strong &amp; decided. Both 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> A.</span> &amp; <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Ch.</span> have English servants who have

<br/>to the <span class="">report</span> above referred to</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We go on much as usual. Walls of school 
<br/>six feet high ᅳ  Measurement 48 by 20 ᅳ this morning
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Hope to finish it this month ᅳ We have much better 
<br/>soil for building where the school is than we had 
<br/>in this house - <span class="">Apie</span> came last week &amp; passed 
<br/>on to the Bamangwato ᅳ All is peace But we are 
<br/>sorry to hear a report of <span class="">Cumming</span> lying ill at the

<br/>For two things I can feel toothache &amp; broken bones
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> A.</span> presented me with an excellent gun in its case &amp;c.

<br/><p class="p ">I send to you three full grown fruits of the

<br/>the production of a similar impression by

<br/>Translate <span class="">Isaiah</span> by all means &amp; if we have
