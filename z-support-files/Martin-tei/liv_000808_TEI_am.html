<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">11<span class="sup underline ">th</span> October 1853</span> - <span class="">Linyanti</span></p>
<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Man</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I sent you a few days ago <span class="">a long letter</span> per
<br/>a <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Francis Thompson</span> who came up as far as the <span class="">chobe</span> in
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>company with a trader <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Chapman</span> and since I sent off the
<br/><span class="">packet</span> I find I have had time to transcribe the enclosed <span class="">paper</span>
<br/>which I have taken the liberty to believe you will not object
<br/>to read. It contains the marrow of a much longer one
<br/>carefully written for the same destination but it was penned
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>on our way here and though it contains a much fuller
<br/>view than this. Many points are now out of date and
<br/>will be much more so before reaching <span class="">Dr Vaughan</span>
<br/>I had given up the idea of sending it at all, till the idea of an
<br/>abbreviation struck my mind and now I fear that the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>haste evident in its composition &amp; writing will render it
<br/>unfit for the pages of a <span class="">Review</span>. However I send it and
<br/>my object in enclosing it to you is to request you to
<br/>note any passages you may see to be out of date by the
<br/>time you get it and signify the same to the <span class="">D<span class="sup ">r</span></span>. Is this 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>too much to ask? Well, I shall not send you the next
<br/>but will just tell you it is much better than this
<br/>indeed if it were not my own child I would say it is a very
<br/>good one. So good I may perhaps keep it to myself
<br/>altogether. It is on <span class="">missions</span>. The privilege of being allowed
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to engage in them. Their future &amp;c &amp;c. I wrote it in the
<br/>weary way <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: across">accross</span> the desert and if it never does aught
<br/>else it has comforted my own mind.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The second <span class="">paper</span> about which I told you and which
<br/><span class="">Mr Cameron</span> <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">told you</span><span class="add  above">said</span> would be published will not trouble
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>you. I meant it to be a continuation of the same subject
<br/>believing the one would not be complete without the



	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: [no text]">the</span> other. This it seems is not admissable in a <span class="">Review</span>.
<br/>Much of the <span class="">article</span> will be otherwise employed, and as doing 
<br/>good was my object I am quite satisfied. I think I have
<br/>the same object in the present <span class="">article</span>. It is a misfortune
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to be so far from proofsheets, one could make the composition
<br/>so much more smooth and perhaps telling. If I ever send
<br/>that I have by me at present it will be my last.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As I am on the subject of literature I may say you are a
<br/>very fine Editor. The only <span class="">letter</span> of any pretensions in your
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">report</span> has "what is the <span class="underline ">result</span> of these <span class="underline ">effects</span>"? and about ½
<br/>a dozen "<span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: admitting's">addmitting's</span>" spanned onto one <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">trektow</span> of a sentence

<br/>you promised to give the <span class="">manuscripts</span> to the printer. Ah very

<br/>several errors in Longitude by its means, but send
<br/>my observations to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Maclear</span> for verification before
<br/>publishing them. It is probable the <span class="">Lake</span> is wrong
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>as we never attempted or could attempt to establish its
<br/>Longitude. We never had watches worth anything
<br/>you very kindly say you <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">fear</span> for the result of my
<br/>going in here alone. I hope I am in the way of duty
<br/>my own conviction that such is the case has never
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>wavered. I am doing something for God. I have preached
<br/>the <span class="">gospel</span> in many a spot where the name of <span class="">Christ</span>
<br/>has never been heard, and would work still more
<br/>in the way of reducing the Barotsé language - if

<br/>I had not suffered severely from fever. Exhaustion produced
<br/>vertigo, causing me if I looked suddenly up <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">to</span> almost to lose
<br/>consciousness - this made me give up some of my sedentary
<br/>work. But I hope God will accept of what I can do. The

<br/>often 90° at 9 <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: o'clock">oclock</span> at night. But a merry heart doeth
<br/>good like a medicine. If I allowed my mind to dwell
<br/>constantly on the miserable degradation - wickedness &amp;
<br/>sad prospects of the <span class="">people</span> here I might become melancholy
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and soon die. But we have a fair world and all the
<br/>wonderful works of our father in it and I believe we
<br/>ought to allow our minds to dwell on the beautiful more
<br/>than on the evil. I am never low spirited. It might be
<br/>different if I had a crusty companion. I have experience
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>in the matter. And my thoughts never <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">torn</span> with any
<br/>longing except for my family. I think we are immortal
