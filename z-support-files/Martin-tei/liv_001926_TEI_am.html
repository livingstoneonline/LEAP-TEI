<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">A woman had gone over to 
<br/>the other side, we suspect, to get 
<br/>grain from old gardens, came

<br/>expect before I gave him ammuni<br/>tion that he would have gone ere 
<br/>this. He told me that he was 
<br/>occupied in hoeing, and that the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>grass was too long to see the animals 
<br/>I found out subsequently that 
<br/>he is no shot and abandoned 
<br/>the idea that we should get fresh 
<br/>meat from him, consequently</p>

<br/>declined on the plea of working in 
<br/>their gardens and I told them very
