<br/><p class="p noindent">My dear Father</p>
<br/><p class="p ">By the arrival of <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Hans</span> we are enabled to add to our
<br/>string of palavers and <span class="">Joseph</span> having left only a week ago we have not
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>much to add except that our political horizon is considerably brighter.
<br/>This is of some importance for when the public attention is engaged
<br/>by rumours of wars it is more difficult to turn it to matters of higher
<br/>importance. By our spies we have ascertained that the talk of the
<br/><span class="">Boers</span> about <span class="">Sechele</span> is over and the individual near <span class="">Mosega</span> who
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>made a sort of fortification of his house may sleep undisturbed in
<br/>his castle. <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Hans</span> brings us notice that <span class="">Sekhome</span> wishes a missionary
<br/>this if true is surprising for he was very much opposed to the word we
<br/>believe through the influence of <span class="">Apie</span> &amp; <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">France</span> God</span>. His frequently 
<br/>expressed dislike made me feel desirous to visit him. I like to hear
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of one who thinks on the subject. After <span class="">Sechele</span>'s baptism a <span class="">party</span>
<br/>of a distant tribe wished to come here to sell leglets. <span class="">Sekhome</span> would
<br/>not let them, but taking a roundabout course they arrived &amp; told
<br/>us that he had stated as his reason for refusal that <span class="">Sechele</span> had
<br/>become mad.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><p class="p ">We move on as usual - great hunger prevails and a burning
<br/>sun seems to say we shall have another failure of the <span class="">native</span> corn
<br/>crop. This is the fourth year of stunted crops and the Bakwains
<br/>formerly were remarkable for the abundance of their corn. The scarcity
<br/>is usually ascribed to the word of God: the hunger makes some look
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to us without much good will but all are civil in their deportment.
<br/>The school suffered much after the reception of <span class="">Sechele</span> but attendance
<br/>is gradually becoming better. We have finished the roof of <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s
<br/>house today, and there is an appearance of rain. All the fountains in
<br/>the country are dried up. So we cannot grumble &amp; wish we had been
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>elsewhere in this region. I have never seen anything like this
<br/>drought. The very trees seem to feel it. The leaves crumple together
<br/>and we hear that there are some tracts of the <span class="">Bakalahari country</span>
<br/>in which the trees are killed. Our rain makers have thrown 
<br/>their nostrums to the moles &amp; bats and some of them come to the meeting
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>Tell <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Hamilton</span> I have looked at the clouds more this year than
<br/>I did during all the previous years of my life put together and it
<br/>is all <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">gammon</span>. We have had every sort &amp; degree of cloud at all times
<br/>of the day &amp; night &amp; in all quarters. Clouds with calm &amp; clouds with

	

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>wind. fleecy, electric violent thunder clouds thick &amp; thin and not a 
<br/>drop of rain with them. The old grey headed weather-wise jockies were
<br/>as completely nonplussed <span class="add  above">as I</span>. They whistled and whiddled, cheeped &amp; muttered
<br/>and did everything they could (for we do not interfere except in the way
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of occasional discussion) but no rain. We have had only three good
<br/>showers this season if you ask anyone now when it threatens
<br/>do you think it will rain. "It will if it likes" I intend to take
<br/>this as my motto &amp; not trouble the clouds by looking at them.
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">rs</span> M.</span> mentioned a wish to have a Karross from this side. The drought
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>in the <span class="">Kalahari</span> side has been so great very few have been able
<br/>to go thither in search of skins so they are scarcer this year than
<br/>we ever knew. Only those who have Bakalahari near have
<br/>been able to procure any. - The majority of the people have none. We
<br/>have bought none for a long time past on account of the scarcity
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>having raised their value. I think I mentioned a brace &amp; bits
<br/>But have since been supplied with both. I had not seen the
<br/>gun traps at the time I wrote last. I was very much pleased with
<br/>your giblet pie. Can you send two locks for <span class="">natives</span> viz. one
<br/>for <span class="">Sechele</span> &amp; another for <span class="">Mebaloe</span> &amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: then">the</span> specify the price to them
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the roofs of the school temporary &amp; dwelling house with <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s too have
<br/>furnished our supply of nails. You have a box full under the
<br/>bunch of old ones if you wish to see them in use you can
<br/>send a lot here.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We enclose a bill for £60. and should like you to square off
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>at the point at which you summed up when you sent the last
<br/>account and at which there was a balance due by us. of £58..7 
<br/>and £15..4..1 = £73..11..1. To liquidate this, the Bill &amp;
<br/>perhaps something else we do not yet know of the Bill in favour
<br/>of <span class="">Draper &amp; co</span> of £28.12. and the enclosed £60. will if I understand
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>properly be available <span class="figure" title="calculation">{figure}</span>. Let us know if we are right.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am not aware of anything which we need at present except soap
<br/>and rice. And if you can without trouble <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: heifers">hiefers</span>. We find it
<br/>much cheaper to pay a <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: heifer">hiefer</span> per annum than beads by the month or
<br/>week. The Blue neck beads were very useful and those sold 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>produced about 27 sheep a supply which will enable us to hold on
<br/>for some time to come. I thank you heartily for the pans &amp; cocks.
<br/>The former were our only source of mutton chops untill the beads
<br/>came. I am not desirous to obtain any more at present. If
<br/>you can procure ewes at the same rate as formerly 3/ please

<br/>remember us But no goats on account of the disease in the feet here.
<br/>We men were very glad of the powder. We gave three strings of beads for a 
<br/>sheep. <span class="">Hume</span>'s large white <span class="add  above">neck</span> beads are saleable to the <span class="">Eastward</span> but not at his
<br/>prices. If he gave them at about 9<span class="sup ">d</span> a string we could take them but
