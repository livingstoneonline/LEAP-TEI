<br/><p class="p right"><span class="">Bakwain Country</span> <span class="">8<span class="sup underline ">th</span> April 1842</span></p>
<br/><p class="p left">Dear Sir</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Before <span class="">this letter</span> can reach you, you may have concluded that I have 
<br/>fogotten my promise to write you concerning your son <span class="">Manning</span>. But many 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>reasons have induced me to delay and when I reflect on the different feelings 
<br/>which agitated my mind as circumstances connected with <span class="">missions</span> in the country 
<br/>were made known to me. I am glad I have been prevented from writing you 
<br/>sooner. Had I written you before this very probably the <span class="">communications</span> 
<br/>would have had a tinge of what was at the time causing me either joy or 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>grief. for I daresay you know that though in the Mission field there are 
<br/>many things which it would be well for the people in <span class="">England</span> to know, there 
<br/>are others which it is well they <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know. Here I am quite <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">as much</span> separated from 
<br/>both the failings &amp; excellences of the <span class="">missionary community</span> as you are, and have 
<br/>been so for some months. I think I shall on that account be able to give 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>a calmer view of the state of matters so that you may form a correct 
<br/>judgement of how you ought to act with respect to <span class="">Manning</span>. I have 
<br/>written several times to <span class="">Thomas</span> &amp; have mentioned to him some of the things 
<br/>which form the dark side of the picture. I feel very anxious on his account 
<br/>for I fear that after all I can say that when he comes &amp; looks in matters 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>with different eyes <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">to</span> than mine he may feel disappointed. I fear he will 
<br/>take a more pervasive view than I do, for you will <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">have</span> seen if you have 
<br/>looked into <span class="">my letters</span> that I have far too much levity in my composition 
<br/>This is not as it ought to be but I always felt, when writing, not in 
<br/><span class="">Africa</span> but in <span class="">Gower Ct.</span>. You must therefore make allowances for this 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>failing of mine. Adding to the difficulties your sons will encounter the sad- 
<br/>ness which arises from being <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">a</span> strangers in a strange land. I fear for them 
<br/>on this account. <span class="underline ">It will be</span> a sacrifice for them to make. I believe it is to 
<br/>most. And I almost wish it were to me to sober me down a little</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Neither <span class="">Thomas</span> nor <span class="">Manning</span> must for a moment think of settling in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the <span class="">Colony</span> or even in <span class="">Caffreland</span>. If they come at all it must be to the 
<br/><span class="">Interior</span>. If they halt before they reach the <span class="">Tropic</span> the spot where I now write 
<br/>they had much better remain in <span class="">England</span>. I shall endeavour to explain 
<br/>just what one would wish them to be But it would seems these 
<br/>are not sufficient for the people or rather for the missionaries 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>You find missionaries in some places better supplied with his bread 
<br/>of life than many of <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">of</span> like size in <span class="">England</span>. There is <span class="">Algoa  
<br/>Bay</span> This village is certainly not larger perhaps not so large as 
<br/><span class="">Ongar</span> but it has a Roman Catholic, a Wesleyan, &amp; one of our miss<br/>ionaries with one of our schoolmasters who preaches to the <span class="">blacks</span> 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>His clergymen besides but as neither he nor the <span class="">Roman Cath. nuns</span> are 
<br/>evangelical. I shall say three evangelical missionaries to a place 
<br/>the size of <span class="">Ongar</span>,<span class="space" title="space: 4 chars ">        </span> a small town you will find 
<br/>the population in a <span class="">Gazetteer</span>. They are chiefly the descendants of Dutch
<br/>missionaries of our <span class="">society</span>, one of whom takes all the <span class="">blacks</span> under 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>his charge. A clergyman &amp; <span class="">government</span> schoolmaster who preaches  
<br/>all evangelical: <span class="">Graham's Town</span> is quite an English place has also 
<br/>one of our missionaries but not having seen it I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know 
<br/>how large it is or how supplied by other <span class="">societies</span>. <span class="">Graaf Rennet</span></p>
	<p class="ab ">
<br/><span class="">8<span class="sup ">th</span> May</span> By a <span class="">letter to <span class="">Thomas</span> of this date</span> I inform him of the reasons which prevented my going westward as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>mentioned in this but I hope my coming here will also be attended by good to souls. Yours <span class="space" title="space: 6 chars ">            </span><span class="">DL.</span></p>

<br/><p class="p ">has a most excellent clergyman &amp; our missionary is his curate. <span class="">Colesberg</span>
<br/>I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> believe it has more than 500 of a population. A Wesleyan, 
<br/>of ours &amp; a clergyman all evangelical. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> say anything <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">more</span> of the 
<br/>real <span class="">mission stations</span> such as <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Monkey</span></span> <span class=""><span class="">Bethelsdorp</span></span>, <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Rat</span> River</span> &amp;c 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>There ought to be &amp; are all supplied with missionaries. But I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> help 
<br/>thinking that the poor <span class="">Christians</span> in <span class="">England</span> are defended by the rich 
<br/>English people in these towns above mentioned who detain missionaries 
<br/>amongst them. Some of them indeed such as <span class="">Graham's Town</span> rai<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">se</span>
<br/>as much as pays the salary of their pastor. But then the expense of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>outfit &amp;c. and in some instances education too (<span class="">Robson</span>) stands a black 
<br/>debt unliquidated. If missionaries are detained by English people I suppose 
<br/>justice requires that they should in addition to defraying all expenses of the 
<br/>missionary send another on to the destination appointed by the <span class="">Directors</span>
<br/>If not they defend the real <span class="">heathen</span> for to them these missionaries 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>were appointed. <span class="">Mr Robson</span> for instance was appointed to <span class="">Lattabao</span>-- 
<br/>Perhaps however it is not the fault of the English population. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> know 
<br/>I will not condemn my bretheren But all of them with whom I convened 
<br/>seemed anxious to impress my mind with the idea that they had very large 
<br/>spheres of usefulness (Perhaps they have I however could not see it in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the same light they did). And if they have spoken so to the <span class="">Directors</span> of course 
<br/>the fault does not lie with them. It is not in the <span class="">Colony</span> as it is in <span class="">India</span>
<br/>A missionary there can do more good by means of the liberality of the 
<br/>English for support of schools than by attending exclusively to the <span class="">natives</span> 
<br/>and the chieftains there are generally <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">not</span> evangelical. But here, whoever heard 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of the liberality of the <span class="">South African Colonist</span>? Where is there either a school 
<br/>or anything else shewn as the fruits of their liberality? The clergymen of the 
<br/>Dutch church which is the established form are generally evangelical too 
<br/>It is not pleasant to write these things, but it is absolutely necessary for one  
<br/>to know them before he can judge of the spiritual wants of the country. Please 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>us to count the number of missionaries of all denominations. The <span class="">clergy</span> 
<br/>&amp; compare it with the amount of <span class="">Colonial</span> population. And I am sure 
<br/>you will not appoint <span class="">Manning</span> to the <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; "><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">that</span></span> part of the country.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">Then as to <span class="">Caffretown</span>. There are many missionaries in it &amp; there 
<br/>of almost every <span class="">society</span> in existence. The habits of the <span class="">Caffres</span> are unsocial 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>They do not congregate round one chief like the Bechwanas, but each 
<br/>lives with his few cattle &amp; dependants to retire by himself. the population 
<br/>is therefore much scattered and one of the greatest difficulties is to get 
<br/>a few families collected &amp; afterwards to keep them together. I do not 
<br/>however speak of them from personal knowledge but from the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>testimony of those who have had opportunities of examining the country
<br/>They cannot either remain near <span class="">Kuruman</span>. While the missionaries 
<br/>in the <span class="">Colony</span> may be heard in the towns expatiating on their large spheres 
<br/>of usefulness More on this side the river especially the <span class="">Kuruman</span> &amp; 
<br/><span class="">Griqua Town</span> missionaries are exchanging sour looks on account 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>of what they deem encroachments on each others spheres. <span class="">Griqua 
<br/>Town</span> by means of <span class="">native</span> teachers is expanding delightfully. I wish 
<br/><span class="">Kuruman</span> would do the same. I heard a brother about 2 months ago 
<br/>tell another then on a visit to <span class="">K.</span> from about 100 miles <span class="">East</span> of it. That 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Moffat</span> wants bring out a reinforcement of missionaries to live at 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span><span class="">Kuruman</span>. What will they do here. O we shall itinerate occasionally to Towns! 
<br/>and this the only <span class="">heathen</span> place in the neighbourhood of our visitor to which

       

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>he can itinerate. On mentioning this to the French bretheren at <span class="">Motecto</span>. 15 miles 
<br/><span class="">North East</span> of <span class="">K.</span> "A reinforcement to <span class="">K.</span>" said they "will put us out altogether 
<br/>we must leave all we have done &amp; seek a new people<span class="underline ">"</span>-- &amp; it will be 
<br/>so. Unless the new missionaries go forward they will not have work 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>equal to what they might find in thousands of villages in <span class="">England</span>
<br/>The population is by no means dense. The Bechuanas consist of tribes each 
<br/>of from 1 to 2000 in number. The Battapee. The <span class="">Kuruman</span> Tribe is 
<br/>however an exception, as it has from 10 to 12000, &amp; of which at least 
<br/>are bitterly opposed to the <span class="">gospel</span>. You cannot have a large sphere 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of usefulness here unless you come far into the <span class="">Interior</span> &amp; then although 
<br/>residing at one spot you must extend your energies over a large 
<br/>space by means of <span class="">native</span> teachers. I know about a dozen of <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: illegible">[  ]</span>
<br/>tribes beyond this all quite ignorant. I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> much <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 2 chars, cause: tear">[  ]</span><span class="add  inline">ex</span>pect to understand 
<br/>it is like an Indian population. Say each is 2000 in number &amp; you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>can form a pretty correct idea of what you might meet after trav- 
<br/>a degree of latitude between each. I earnestly recommend my Dear Friend 
<br/><span class="">Thomas</span> if he is permitted in the providence of God to come here at all to determine 
<br/>resolutely to preach the <span class="">gospel</span> in the regions beyond. <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Don't">Dont</span> let him enter on another 
<br/>line of things By bold determination I see nothing to hinder him along with <span class="">Manning</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>from <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">earning</span> an interest which may <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">be</span> more useful to the <span class="">Interior</span> than any mission 
<br/><span class="">Southward</span>. I shall write <span class="">Manning</span> along with this explaining in what manner 
<br/>he could be by the blessing of God as useful as any of us. It would also be better 
<br/>for <span class="">Miss R.</span> than any where near <span class="">Kuruman</span>, for I think from her appearance 
<br/>the bleak sterile prospects which that country affords would have a depressing 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>influence on her spirits &amp; ultimately induce disease. The country gener<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 4 chars, cause: waxseal">[    ]</span>
<br/>around <span class="">Kuruman</span> for a great portion of the year a wretched wi<span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 6 chars, cause: waxseal">[      ]</span>
<br/>appearance. The fields have a great profusion of low soggy bushes 
<br/>(scarcely any trees) most of them arrived with thorns which <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 1 chars, cause: hole">[ ]</span>re either bent 
<br/>back like fish hooks or forwards in every direction but all villainously 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>sharp &amp; strong. The grass grows in little round clumps and there is more 
<br/>stones &amp; sand between than bushes <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">shrubs</span> plants &amp; grass together.
<br/>During one portion of the year at a distance it looks beautifully green
<br/>But even then one <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: can't">cant</span> walk in the fields with any pleasure and 
<br/>this is an exercise which she must take. <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Campbell</span> visited it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>during the favourable season &amp; he speaks of some parts as equal 
<br/>to <span class="">Mahomet</span>'s paradise. I spent a few days in that paradise at 
<br/>a different season of the year &amp; I was most happy when I got 
<br/>out of it. But as we approach the <span class="">Tropic</span> the country loses its browned 
<br/>parched appearance. <span class="gap" title="gap, extent: 3 chars, cause: hole">[   ]</span> dwells here are covered all over with trees 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>the red sandstone rocks looking pleasantly out here &amp; there from 
<br/>between them. But towards the <span class="">South</span> they are quite bare. There 
<br/>the vegetation is quite tropical the nettle is no longer a mere plant 
<br/>but grows up to a tree a foot or more in diameter &amp; from 20 to 
<br/>30 in height. The wild figtree abounds on the mountains &amp; though it 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>yields little fruit, its presence indicated that fruits would thrive 
<br/>better here than at <span class="">Kuruman</span>. I think all the Tropical fruits might 
<br/>be reared here without much trouble.  Am immense amount of 
<br/>manual labour has been expended on <span class="">Kuruman</span> to make it what 
<br/>it is. All the trees had to be planted. Here you might select 
<br/><span class="linenumber">50</span>a dozen sprouts for building each of them superior in picturesque 
<br/>beauty to any mission I have seen &amp; the trees ready to your hand</p>
