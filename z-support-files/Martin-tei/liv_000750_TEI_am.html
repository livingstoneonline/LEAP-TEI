<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of the departure of <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Livingston</span> and four <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: children">chidren</span> on board the
<br/>"Trafalgar" <span class="">Captain D. Robertson</span>, bound for <span class="">London</span>. She
<br/>sailed on the <span class="">23<span class="sup ">d</span> currt</span>. And as this goes by the <span class="">Royal Mail Steamer</span>
<br/>which will sail on the <span class="">first of May</span>, you will in all probability

<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><p class="p ">In thus committing my family to your care I may state
<br/>that nothing but the fullest convictions of duty would have
<br/>led me to adopt this step, but having already addressed you
<br/>twice on this subject, and by full and explicit statements
<br/>endeavored to furnish data on which to form your
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>own <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Judgment">Judgement</span>, I feel the less inclined to advert to the subject
<br/>again. Your silence however makes me fear that <span class="">my
<br/>letters</span> may have miscarried, and I shall add that our chidren have
<br/>claims on those by whom <span class="underline ">we</span> are sent. It is well known that 
<br/>the laws of God avenge themselves on those by whom they
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>are <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: condemned">contemned</span>. they resemble two edged swords when caught
<br/>by the blades. The Emigrant <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> who despise the law of
<br/>benevolence enuntiated in the declaration that God hath 
<br/>made of one blood all the nations of the Earth are themselves
<br/>becoming as degraded as the <span class="">natives</span> whom they despise -
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>A <span class=""><span class="">slave</span> population</span> every-where works the ruin and degradation
<br/>of the free class which employs it. Tyranny and every 
<br/>other form of vice reproduce themselves and the moral con-
<br/>-tagion spreads like leaves by means of the children. It is
<br/>but just that such contagions should infect those who

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>fear not the vengeance of the divine laws or of Him who is their 
<br/>author. But missionaries expose their children to a contamination
<br/>which they have had no hand in producing. We expose them 
<br/>and ourselves for a time in order to elevate those sad captives
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of sin and satan who are the victims of the degradation
<br/>of ages. None of those who complain about missionaries
<br/>sending their chidren home ever descend to this. And again
<br/>as <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> James</span> in his "young men from home" forcibly shews
<br/>a greater misfortune cannot befall a youth than to be cast
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>into the world entirely without a home. In regard to even 
<br/>the vestige of a home my children are absolutely vagabonds
<br/>"When shall we return to <span class="">Kolobeng</span>"? "When to <span class="">Kuruman</span>"? <span class="underline ">Never</span>
<br/>The mark of <span class="">Cain</span> is on your foreheads. your father is a
<br/>missionary." Our children ought to have both the sympathies
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and prayers <span class="add  above">of those</span> at whose bidding we become strangers for life</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I intend to leave this during the course of the next week. 
<br/>I need scarcely again advert to the plans which in consequence
<br/>of what I believe to be the direct leadings of Providence I have
<br/>been led to form. In passing in to the distant region to which
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I feel called. I shall have to mourn over the defection of <span class="">Sechele</span>
<br/>now more apparent than ever. By letters which I have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span>
<br/>since I have come to <span class="">Cape Town</span> I learn that <span class="">Sechele</span> has
<br/>plundered an Englishman whom he believed to have killed
<br/>one of his people. I have little doubt but such is the fact
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>The Englishman being a person of immoral character and the
<br/>companion of the missing <span class="">native</span> declares that the Englishman
<br/>inflicted injuries sufficient to terminate life &amp; then left him.
<br/>Two companions of this same man (<span class="">Moyle</span>) have perished in suspicious
<br/>circumstances. One of them named <span class="">Dalman</span> perished near to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><span class="">Kolobeng</span> but being <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: on">in</span> the way to <span class="">Cape Town</span> at the time of his
<br/>death I can give no particulars. The plunder of <span class="">Moyle</span> by <span class="">Sechele</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>is quite unjustifiable and as I stated before I believe <span class="">Sechele</span> is an
<br/>apostate. He cannot be referred to as a trophy of grace but never
<br/>did man bid fairer for years to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
<br/>than he. You will see no success in that region so long as
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Inglis</span> and <span class="">Edwards</span> are your missionaries. It would be absurd to
<br/>expect the Divine blessing. I am sorry to write so but it is the
<br/>truth, and truth which ought to be known by the <span class="">Directors</span>. I do
<br/>not wish to be or appear censorious but were I now placed
<br/>in the most solemn circumstances my past experience of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>vicinity of these men would lead me to declare that it is a
<br/>mere waste of life to labour near the<span class="add  inline">m</span><span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">se men</span>. Eight years
<br/>experience has only strengthened the conviction that our <span class="">Society</span>
<br/>would be incalculably more useful were there a safety valve
<br/>by which such characters would be let off.</p>
