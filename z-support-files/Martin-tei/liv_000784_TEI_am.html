<br/>for the <span class="">Colonies</span></span>, I wrote to the <span class="">Lieutenant  
<br/>Governor Darling</span> an account of the attack 
<br/>of the <span class="">Boers</span> on <span class="">Kolobeng</span> and sent also

<br/>I scarcely expect any compensation but  
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>thought the more noise we made the less
<br/>likely would they be to do the same thing 
<br/>over again. But the more I become

<br/>I have of the least favour being shewn to  
<br/>anything in the shape of either missionary or 
<br/><span class="">Hottentot</span>. Indeed it would be unspeakably 
<br/>pleasing to <span class="">Sir George</span> to hang us all on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>one gibbet. He will never forgive the  
<br/><span class="">Hottentots</span> for completely foiling him in war  
<br/>nor us missionaries because our belief 
<br/>that <span class="">Hottentots</span> have souls has turned out 
<br/>in connection with the name of this mighty
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>man of valour, true all the world over. 
<br/>Such being the case I mustered courage to  
<br/>write to his master <span class="">Sir John Pakington</span>. 
<br/>I think I have good cause for complaint  
<br/>but whether I have done it in a proper 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>manner and whether it ought to be presented 
<br/>at all I leave entirely to your decision</p>
<br/><p class="p ">A <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Codrington</span>, a gentleman of large  
<br/>landed property in <span class="">Wiltshire</span> lost a good  
<br/>deal of property at <span class="">Kolobeng</span>. He had gone  

       

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>down the <span class="">Limpopo</span> on a <span class="">hunting expedition</span> and when 
<br/>he returned his cattle and goods were gone. As he  
<br/>has <span class="">Parliamentary</span> influence he will make some noise 
<br/>about the affair. He goes home to <span class="">England</span>. now 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>only one half of his cattle were taken and the other 
<br/>half were by some mistake left behind. <span class="">Sechele</span>
<br/>sent them out to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Moffat</span>, and though an 
<br/>attempt was made by the person who had them  
<br/>in charge to steal them, the people here pursued  
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>them - overtook the thievish Englishman - <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">(a <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Simpson</span>)</span> fined
<br/>him and the price of the missing cattle and such  
<br/>as remained are in custody here for the 
<br/>owner. It is pleasant to see the people making 
<br/>efforts to promote justice and perhaps it is 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>not always wrong even to fight for their country 
<br/><span class="weather ">Rains have fallen</span> and I have nearly succeeded  
<br/>in getting a <span class="">complement of men</span>. I fully intend 
<br/>starting from this on the <span class="">14<span class="sup underline ">th</span> currt.</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">I advised you of £10. for books from <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>MacLehose</span> and another £10. for clothing from 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Drummond</span>, neither of which sums, though 
<br/>deducted from my salary have yet been drawn   

       

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>They will be applied for soon. I gave <span class="">Mebaloe</span> £10. in 
<br/>consideration of his losses at <span class="">Kolobeng</span> and because 
<br/>he had kept school and other services and remained  
<br/>at his work up to the commencement of the  
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>firing. He is now at <span class="">Kuruman</span></p>
