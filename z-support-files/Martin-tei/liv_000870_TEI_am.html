<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>my <span class="">Arabian</span> post office man is detained
<br/>at <span class="">Sesheke</span> by the sickness of one of his

<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to express my sympathy in the bereave<br/>ment you have been called on to suffer
<br/>in the departure of your most excellent
<br/>father in law. I hear of it only now
<br/>and as I have always since my attendance
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>on his theological lectures and ministry
<br/>regarded him with very great affection
<br/>I think of his removal with unfeigned
<br/>sorrow. May God grant us grace to
<br/>follow in his footsteps. Unquestionably
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>he served God in his day and generation
<br/>with rare abilities and unswerving devotion
<br/>through good &amp; through bad <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">reports</span>. When
<br/>such are removed we feel somewhat
<br/>nearer to the grave. There seems to be
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>nothing now between it and us. May
<br/>we <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">live</span> to Christ and for the prosperity

<br/>memory.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I believe I did not refer very
<br/>pointedly to what may be called missionary
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>prospects in this region. And the reason is
<br/>I feel perplexed on one point viz. the
<br/>insalubrity of the climate. It is no obstacle
<br/>to myself personally. I think no <span class=""><span class="">London</span>
<br/>society</span>'s "<span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">zendeling</span></span>" worth his salt. would
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>bolt at that. Even though we have
<br/>no law against cowardice (vide the 2<span class="sup ">d Art.</span>
<br/>of the <span class="">Bushman</span> commando mighty men
<br/>of valour) most of our fellows must
<br/>feel in the same way. And my better
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>half would go as readily as any one. But
<br/>I am not clear on exposing my
<br/>little ones without their own intelligent
<br/>self dedication. As far as opportunity
<br/>goes there is no lack. There are tribes
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>and villages without number to the <span class="">North</span>
<br/>and <span class="">East</span> of this and all would be proud
<br/>of the presence of a <span class="">white man</span>. I
<br/>know of no hindrance to missionary operations
<br/>in any part of the country <span class="">North of
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>the <span class="">Zambesi</span></span> and towards the <span class="">centre
<br/>of the <span class="">Continent</span></span>. And every day we hear 
<br/>of commerce extending its ramifications
<br/>in all directions. Only think of the
<br/>way this <span class="">letter</span> goes. by an <span class="">Arab</span> from

    

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><span class="">Zanzibar</span> who takes charge of a <span class="">party of
<br/>Makololo</span> with ivory for <span class="">Loanda</span>. When
<br/>they return <span class="">my <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">late</span> companions</span> will
<br/>be ready to start again. So one relay will
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>always be abroad on business. Before
<br/>my trip the Makololo never visited another
<br/>tribe except to plunder. They have not
<br/>given this trade up yet, for two forays
<br/>were made during my absence. (not being 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>in the country I did not lend my pot <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">again)</span>
<br/>What a mercy, the "ill report" <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: won't">wont</span> be
<br/>retailed in <span class="">Government House</span> again)
<br/>But <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">the</span> remedy for that and every evil
<br/>is being applied. The blessed word of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the living God has been preached though
<br/>in much weakness - and the prayers
<br/>of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: God's">Gods</span> people</span> are ascending as incense

<br/>the time is coming, the set time, when
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>all nations shall call Him blessed.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have been guilty of some innocent
<br/>wonderment in seeing it stated in terms
<br/>lugubrious enough that the Bakwains
<br/>Bakhatla and Bahurutse &amp;c were not a
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>whit better for all our labours, nay
<br/>much worse. I followed the rule <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: invariably">invaribly</span>
<br/>of making no enquiries respecting the
<br/>labours or conduct of other missionaries
<br/>among <span class=""><span class="underline ">natives</span></span> and therefore can say



	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>nothing about Bahurutse or Bakhatla. But
<br/>about the Bakwains the verdict would I most
<br/>sincerely think, require reconsideration. During
<br/>the whole of our sojourn there we strove so to
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>conduct ourselves as that there should be no
<br/>cause of offence except concerning the law
<br/>of our God. I feel humbly and heartily
<br/>thankful to our Heavenly father for enabling
<br/>us to effect this. <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">This</span> is a point of
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>vital importance in estimating what <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: has">his</span>
<br/>been effected among a people. So when
<br/>we left we had not one single enemy
<br/>in the whole tribe x <span class="addmargin"> [<span class="vertical "><span class="note  ">if it were necessary for me to seek a "character" I 
would confidently refer to the Bakwains for it</span></span>] </span> and even when the
<br/>waggon was inspanned on our departure
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>for <span class=""><span class="">Sebituane</span>'s country</span>. <span class="">Sechele</span> and
<br/><span class="">his principal <span class="add  above">men</span></span><span class="add  below">^</span> tried to persuade me
<br/>to remove to the (afterwards) scene of the
<br/>massacre of <span class="">his people</span>, offering to build
<br/>a house and church free of expence.
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I need not refer to my reasons for
<br/>refusing - (I am perfectly satisfied as to their
<br/>validity) except that the principal one was
<br/>determined hostility to the requirements
<br/>of the <span class="">gospel</span> unmixed with any hostility
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to ourselves. Some may think this



	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>hostility to the <span class="">gospel</span> evidence of deterior-
<br/>ation from their state of heathenism
<br/>I believe it to be a most important
<br/>step in advance from that state.
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>for though they refuse to bow in
<br/>humility to the Divine law, the truths
<br/>they have imbibed exert a most
<br/>salutary influence on their morals * <span class="addmargin"> [<span class="vertical "><span class="note  "><span class="">Sechele</span> asked the <span class="">Boers</span> on commando not to fight on Sunday.

<br/>I know this to be a fact - a plain
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>palpable fact. And if any one
<br/>doubts it. As he cannot compare
<br/>what the Bakwains were with what
<br/>they are let a comparison be
<br/>made between the Makololo and
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Bakwains. Why in <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">coming from Makololo</span> meeting with

<br/>as the Bakwains I used to feel
<br/>I had entered civilized life, I
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> wonder at it. The word of
<br/>the living God has been brought in
<br/>contact with their hearts &amp; <span class="add  above">minds</span> His
<br/>word has life and power. Few



	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>human <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">souls</span> can withstand its force
<br/>and no hatred however deep can
<br/>quench its power. I bless God
<br/>from the bottom of my heart for
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>allowing me to sow the good seed
<br/>among the Bakwains. Their present
<br/>posture is a terrible one if they continue
<br/>so to the end. But though they do <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">so</span> it
<br/>is God's will the offer should be made
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>though thousands both white and black
