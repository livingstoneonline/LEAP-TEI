<lb rend="right"/><salute>May it please your excellency</salute>
    </opener>
                
<lb rend="right"/><p>I was entrusted
<lb/>with certain presents and a letter from the
<lb/><orgName>Government of <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName></orgName> for <persName>Sekeletu</persName> the
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term> of the people called <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> living on the
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> near the centre of the continent, it
<lb/>is my duty to give your excellency as full
<lb/>an account of the manner in which the
<lb/>bounty was <choice><orig>recieved</orig><reg>received</reg></choice> as possible. I wrote
<lb/>a hasty letter to the <persName>Right Reverend Lord Bishop</persName>
<lb/>of <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName> immediately after my arrival
<lb/>at the town of <persName>Sekeletu</persName> and sent it by the
<lb/><orgName>Arab</orgName> <persName>Ben Habib</persName> of <placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName> who was
<lb/>appointed to head another party with ivory
<lb/>for <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>. This letter may appear as
<lb/>a repitition of the information contained
<lb/>in that, but such is the case only because
<lb/>of my earnest desire to be certain that
<lb/>the <orgName>government</orgName> <del type="strikethrough">should</del> <add place="above">had</add> <choice><orig>recieved</orig><reg>received</reg></choice> precise
<lb/>intelligence that its kind treatment of
<lb/><persName>Sekeletu</persName> and his people has been well
<lb/>appreciated as could have been expected
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>from a savage nation. The presents of both
<lb/>the <orgName>Government</orgName> and <orgName><term type="occupation">merchants</term> of <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName></orgName>
<lb/>were delivered in presence of a large concourse 
<lb/>of people including some strangers, and
<lb/>translations of the <bibl>letters</bibl> to <persName>Sekeletu</persName> read aloud
<lb/>so as to make the matter as public as
<lb/>possible. The <term type="occupation">General</term>'s dress, sword, sash,
<lb/>epaulettes and cocked hat, were all exhibited
<lb/>to the admiring gaze of the crowd. And the tail
<lb/>of the <term type="animal">horse</term> which unfortunately died at
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Golungo Alto</settlement></placeName> was shown in evidence of the
<lb/>fact by my companions. Every article
<lb/>too sent by the <term type="occupation">merchants</term> was fully
<lb/>examined by all. And <persName>Sekeletu</persName> with his 
<lb/>principal men expressed repeatedly great
<lb/>satisfaction at the result of our journey
<lb/>thankfulness for the frienship of the head
<lb/>of the <orgName>Provisional Government</orgName>, and joy
<lb/>in prospect of being able to trade with
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName> expressed over and over again
<lb/>must be considered as the answer
<lb/>to the letters of <orgName>Government</orgName> and the <term type="occupation">Merchants</term>
<lb/>for when I asked afterwards what I
<lb/>should say in my letter the same expression
<lb/>was made use of. I consider the
<lb/>prompt dispatch of another party with, 
<lb/>it is said, forty tusks for <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>, 
<lb/>as more valuable evidence of confidence 
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>than any expressions of the tongue, And my
<lb/>opinion was asked whether presents for the
<lb/><term type="occupation">governor</term> and <term type="occupation">merchants</term> ought to be
<lb/>sent now or by my late companions
<lb/>Not having entire confidence in the <orgName>Arab</orgName> 
<lb/>who has unlimited power over the ivory
<lb/>the party being ordered only to "look and
<lb/>learn", I gave my opinion that it would
<lb/>be better to send them via <persName>Pitsane</persName>, As
<lb/>both the <orgName>Government</orgName> and <term type="occupation">merchants</term>
<lb/>would estimate their value not by the
<lb/>amount, but as <choice><orig>shewing</orig><reg>showing</reg></choice> proper feelings
<lb/>of respect and gratitude. The fact of
<lb/><persName>Sekeletu</persName> asking spontaneously the
<lb/>above question, will no doubt be
<lb/>considered as so far satisfactory. My
<lb/>late companions are allowed to rest
<lb/>some time and it is intended that they will
<lb/>then return as independent <term type="occupation">traders</term>. They
<lb/>all express joy at the prospect, and this
<lb/>is more than I expected from men who
<lb/>underwent so much hunger and fatigue,
<lb/>for they have all plenty of food and liquor
<lb/>at home. Other tribes as those of <unclear cert="medium"><term type="tribe">Katema</term></unclear>
<lb/>and <term type="tribe">Shinte</term> promised to send men with
<lb/>them for the same purposes, and I believe
<lb/>if no untoward event transpires a brisk
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>trade will in a few years be formed
<lb/>between the interior and the coast.</p>
<lb/><p>In coming Eastwards lately I found
<lb/>the navigation of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> obstructed
<lb/>by a large <unclear cert="medium">rent</unclear> from bank to
<lb/>bank of the rocky bottom. This <unclear cert="medium">rent</unclear>
<lb/>is <measure>one hundred feet down</measure> and its
<lb/>lips are from <measure>60 to 80 feet apart</measure>. It is
<lb/>made first from bank to bank 
<lb/>and then prolonged from the left bank
<lb/>away through <measure>thirty or forty miles</measure> of
<lb/>hills. Into this the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> of a <measure>thousand
<lb/>yards broad</measure> rolls and is compressed at
<lb/>the bottom into <measure>fifteen or twenty yards</measure>
<lb/>the enormous compression it suffers
<lb/>from the force of its own fall down
<lb/><measure>100 feet</measure>, causes the formation and
<lb/>ascent of columns of vapour which
<lb/>like steam ascend <measure>300 or 400 feet high</measure>,
<lb/>then lose their steam colour, become
<lb/>dark and descend in a constant
<lb/>shower. These columns of vapour
<lb/>may be seen, (when the river is full)
<lb/>and the sound heard, <measure>ten or twelve
<lb/>miles off</measure>.</p> <!-- tweet -JM--><!-- Livingstone's description of Victoria Falls evokes the local name: Mosi oa Tunya, the Smoke that Thunders. JM -->
<lb/><p>It is evident that this remarkable
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">rent</unclear> must always have been a barrier
<lb/>to canoe navigation up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName>
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0005" n="0005"/>
<lb/>But something else <add place="above margintop" hand="#U">5</add> must have prevented <add place="above margintop" hand="#U">ms 22</add>
<lb/><orgName>European</orgName> commerce from entering the
<lb/>great valley in which <persName>Sekeletu</persName> lives. 
<lb/>The settlement of <unclear cert="medium"><placeName><settlement type="village">Zumbo</settlement></placeName></unclear> is not far
<lb/>distant, not more than <measure>200 miles</measure>, 
<lb/>and the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> of those days in
<lb/>which <placeName><settlement type="town">Zumbo</settlement></placeName> flourished were not
<lb/>wanting in energy. But I believe the
<lb/>savage customs of the tribes around
<lb/>the falls were sufficient to account
<lb/>for the want of intercourse. The crania
<lb/>of strangers were considered ornamental 
<lb/>and <choice><sic>asassination</sic><corr>assassination</corr></choice> frequently resorted to,
<lb/>to procure them. I counted between
<lb/>fifty and sixty such mounted on <!-- I am not certain whether I should use the measure tag in this line. JM --><!-- No. AW -->
<lb/>poles in one village. It would have
<lb/>been impossible to have made a way
<lb/>through such a people, but <persName>Sebituana</persName>
<lb/>the father of <persName>Sekeletu</persName>, conquered them
<lb/>all, and thereby rendered a good service
<lb/>both to humanity and commerce. 
<lb/>The only use formerly made of ivory
<lb/>in this region was armlets and 
<lb/>gravestones. On the island called
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="island">Kalai</geogName></placeName>, <measure>8 miles</measure> above the falls
<lb/>I saw seventy large tusks planted
<lb/>round the grave of a late <term type="occupation">chief</term> and
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0006" n="0006"/>
<lb/>there were thirty more over the resting
<lb/>places of his relatives. I imagine no
<lb/>more ivory will be wasted in that way
<lb/>now that the people <choice><orig>percieve</orig><reg>perceive</reg></choice>its value.</p>
<lb/><p>I intend to proceed to <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>now, but on my return, there may not
<lb/>be very much difficulty in establishing
<lb/>a communication between the
<lb/>Western and Eastern possessions
<lb/>of the <term type="people">Portuguese</term><!-- Or OrgName? EM--><!-- OK as is. AW -->. This has I understand
<lb/>been the wish of different <term type="occupation">governor</term>s <hi rend="large">*</hi> <!-- There is a star symbol drawn in the right-hand margin here that directs the reader to the vertical note in the left-hand margin of the page JM -->

<add place="marginleft" rend="vertical"><note><!-- The corresponding star symbol is found in the bottom left-hand corner of the page and designates the beginning of the vertical note mentioned above. JM --><hi rend="large">*</hi> <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>The want of such a path may now not be so apparent as in former
<lb/>times when there was no communication by the <placeName><geogName type="sea">Red Sea</geogName></placeName> and <placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName></note></add>

<lb/>and if it still appears desirable I may
<lb/>suggest the way from <placeName><settlement type="village">Pungo Andongo</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>to <placeName><settlement type="village">Bihe</settlement></placeName>. From <placeName><settlement type="village">Bihe</settlement></placeName> to the nearest
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term> on the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName>, say to
<lb/><persName>Mpololo</persName> the uncle of <persName>Sekeletu</persName> who
<lb/>lives at <placeName><settlement type="village">Naliele</settlement></placeName> (<choice><abbr>Lat</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice> 15º 24' South and 
<lb/><choice><abbr>Long</abbr><expan>Longitude</expan></choice> 23º East.) The <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> would
<lb/>send any letters or dispatches safely
<lb/>down to my future dwelling place
<lb/>which will probably be near the 
<lb/>falls (<choice><abbr>Lat</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice> 15º 57' South. <choice><abbr>Long.</abbr><expan>Longitude</expan></choice> 26º 6' <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice>)
<lb/>And as we hope to have water
<lb/>communication with <placeName><settlement type="village">Tete</settlement></placeName>, this
<lb/>would complete the only difficult
<lb/>part of the continent. It is only
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0007" n="0007"/>
<lb/>a suggestion at present.<add place="above margintop" hand="#U">7</add> And I mention <add place="above margintop" hand="#U">ms 22</add>
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Pungo Andongo</settlement></placeName> and <placeName><settlement type="village">Bihe</settlement></placeName> because of
<lb/>the well known public spirit of <persName><choice><abbr>S<hi rend="underline">t</hi></abbr><expan>Saint</expan></choice>
<lb/>Pires</persName> who has trade relations with all that
<lb/>country. There would be more difficulty
<lb/>in the return from <placeName>Mpololo</placeName><!-- Or is this a settlement? EM--><!-- Does indeed sound like a settlement. AW --> to <placeName><settlement type="village">Bihe</settlement></placeName>.
<lb/>I need scarcely add that any service
<lb/>I could render not involving an
<lb/>actual outlay of my small salar<hi rend="sup">ry</hi>
<lb/>would be cheerfully and gratuitously
<lb/>rendered. I mention this because
<lb/>the <orgName>society</orgName> to which I am attached, does
<lb/>not pretend to give a salary, but only
<lb/>enough for subsistence and it varies
<lb/>according to the expence of living in 
<lb/>different countries.</p>
<lb/><p>I have found the <term type="people">Portuguese</term>
<lb/>here as kind as in <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName>, and that
<lb/>is saying a great deal, for I shall
<lb/>ever remember the hospitality and
<lb/>good will of the <term type="people">Angolese</term> both official
<lb/>and private, with gratitude and affection
<lb/>some how or other, I had imbibed a
<lb/>sort of prejudice against the <term type="people">Portuguese</term>
<lb/>probably on account of some few
<lb/>sticking most <unclear cert="high">pertinaceously</unclear> to the <orgName>slave trade</orgName>. But the uniform kind
    
    <pb facs="liv_000892_0008" n="0008"/>
<lb/>treatment and politeness completely removed
<lb/>all prejudice and now when I make
<lb/>use of expressions of gratitude they are
