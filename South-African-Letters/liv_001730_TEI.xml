<lb/><orgName><term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> <orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> decamped

<lb/>We reached them about <measure>12 miles</measure>
<lb/>from the <orgName>mission station</orgName>, and 
<lb/>found them in the act of burning

<lb/>peaceably were neutralized by
<lb/>some <term type="tribe">Maganja</term> followers calling
<lb/>out "our <foreign xml:lang="und">chibisa</foreign> is come" - This

<lb/><term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> attacked us with four muskets
<lb/>and many poisoned arrows
<lb/>and forced us to drive them off
<lb/>with our firearms - a matter
<lb/>for which I am very sorry, as I
<lb/>never had a hostile encounter
<lb/>with the natives before -</p>
<lb/><p>We then left - returned to
<lb/>the ship and carried a boat

<lb/>there are five cataracts in 35'

<lb/>launched the boat above the <w>upper<supplied>-</supplied>

<lb/>because the <placeName><geogName type="river">upper Shire</geogName></placeName> is all

<lb/>above the cataracts, and a lakelet
<lb/><measure>10 or 12 miles</measure> long and <measure>5 or 6</measure> broad.
<lb/>We sailed into the Lake on the

<lb/>and in the North no bottom
<lb/>was found at <measure>116 fathoms</measure> - The
<lb/>Lake is from <measure>18 or 20 to 50 or 60<!-- geog: Lake Nyassa -->
<lb/>miles</measure> broad but we could not
<lb/>cross to measure accurately; 
<lb/>It was very stormy when we

<lb/>The length is over <measure>200 miles</measure>.
<lb/>The shape is an approach to the
<lb/>Boot shape of <placeName><country>Italy</country></placeName>. We were
<lb/>forced to return by want of
<lb/>food without going round the
<lb/>Northern end - War had raged
<lb/>there and the country was
<lb/>depopulated by a tribe of <term type="tribe">Zulus</term>
<lb/>originally from the South,
<lb/>so we were obliged to come
<lb/>back without finding out
<lb/>about the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> - The 
<lb/>chief object of our exploration
<lb/>on the western shore one man
<lb/>would tell us that we might
<lb/>sail out of the Lake into the<!-- geog: Lake Nyassa -->

<lb/>on one point alone did all agree
<lb/>namely, that <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> is a very

<lb/>however that we returned just

<lb/>ship.</p>
<lb/><p>I beg leave to call your attention

<lb/>of 19,000 <orgName>slaves</orgName> which pass annually

<lb/>would be repressed - Without

<lb/>we have opened up - It must be
<lb/>beyond <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> claims, and
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> seems to be best adapted
<lb/>for the object - The <term type="people">Portuguese</term> 
<lb/>watch every step we take and the
<lb/><orgName>Government</orgName> by lately building
<lb/>a port at the mouth of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>intends to enrich itself by dues

<lb/>very anxious that the latter object
<lb/>should be secured while we are
<lb/>busy with the former I hope you
<lb/>excuse me in saying so much</p>
<lb/><p>I have now to thank you
<lb/>for your kind consideration in
<lb/>instructing <persName><term type="occupation">Captain</term> Wilson</persName> to render
<lb/>us assistance, and I can soberly
<lb/>assure you that I feel more
<lb/>grateful for his services than I
<lb/>can express - He brought the Brig
<lb/>having the steamer "Lady of the Lake"
<lb/>on board from <placeName><country><choice><orig>Mosambique</orig><reg>Mozambique</reg></choice></country></placeName> to <placeName><geogName type="harbor">Kongone</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>and put the principal pieces into the
<lb/>Pioneer in a week - a work that
<lb/>would have cost us a month if
<lb/>we could have accomplished it
<lb/>at all - I feel very thankful for

<lb/>in the most frank &amp; obliging
<lb/>manner possible -</p>
<lb/><p>On another point I feel inclined
<lb/>to say very little but am sure
<lb/>that you would not fully
<lb/>understand matters up here
<lb/>if I kept silence - The <term type="occupation">bishop</term>
<lb/>informed us that during
<lb/>our absence at <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake <choice><orig>Nyassa</orig><reg>Nyasa</reg></choice></geogName></placeName>
<lb/>he had gone about <measure>15 miles</measure>
<lb/>and attacked another tribe
<lb/>of <term type="tribe">Ajawas</term> - burned their
<lb/>town and drove them away
<lb/>He took <orgName>2 men of war's men</orgName>
<lb/>and our <term type="occupation">Engineer</term> whom
<lb/>I had sent up for the sake
<lb/>of change of air after being
    
    <pb facs="liv_001730_0014" n="0014"/>
<lb/>much reduced by <term type="ailment">fever</term>. They remembered
<lb/>after they had gone that I had given
<lb/>no orders to them to fight and I
<lb/>excuse them on account of the
<lb/>portion of the gentlemen who
<lb/>asked them to go - I never
<lb/>contemplated the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>
<lb/>doing anything in the offensive
<lb/>and indeed told the <orgName>natives</orgName> before
<lb/>leaving that the <orgName>white men</orgName>
<lb/>would never engage in their
<lb/>quarrels or fight unless
<lb/>attacked as we were. I disapprove
<lb/>of the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> fighting at
<lb/>all except in self defence - but
<lb/>am not very sure what I ought
<lb/>to do to prevent it - I apply by
<lb/>this mail to the <orgName>Government</orgName>
<lb/>for advice on the point. I
    
    <pb facs="liv_001730_0015" n="0015"/>
<lb/>regret very much that by going
<lb/>to try and secure a peaceful
<lb/>settlement for them I became
<lb/>in a measure mixed up with it.</p>
<lb/><p>We left our small boat
<lb/>hoisted up to a shady tree above
<lb/>the uppermost cataract. We<!-- geog: Cataract of the Shire -->
<lb/>have one gig only and very
<lb/>much shattered by the work it
<lb/>has done in laying out <unclear cert="medium">anchors</unclear> &amp;c
<lb/>May I beg a strong cutter gig
<lb/>from the dock yard?</p>
<lb/><p><persName><term type="occupation">Captain</term> Wilson</persName> will inform
