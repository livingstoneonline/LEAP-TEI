<lb/><salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
</opener>

<lb/><p rend="center"> I am sorry that all
<lb/>I have yet to say to you amounts
<lb/>only to 0. I have been detained here
<lb/>during the last four months in
<lb/>consequence of the <orgName>Boers</orgName> having seized
<lb/>our path to the interior. - Now
<lb/>however that the <seg type="weather">rains</seg> have commenced
<lb/>I can pass by a still more westerly
<lb/>path in spite of them. - I shall
<lb/>start tomorrow and hope that when
<lb/>I next write I shall have
<lb/>something of interest to communicate
<lb/><fw rend="right">(all</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>all about the <term type="animal">Unicorn</term>, <term type="animal">Salamander</term>,
<lb/><term type="animal">Phoenix</term> &amp;!) You must be kind
<lb/>enough to take this in the light
<lb/>of a parting salutation. -</p>
<lb/><p>I had several hindrances in
<lb/>the way up - These prevented me
<lb/>from falling into the hands of thee
<lb/><orgName>Boers</orgName>, for it if I had come along
<lb/>as quickly as I wished I should
<lb/>have been at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> at the
<lb/>very time the <term type="occupation">Commando</term> rifled my
<lb/>house, - they expressed much sorrow
<lb/>because they had not got my head
<lb/>as well as my property. They hate
<lb/>me cordially, and I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> think there
<lb/>is much love lost between us. The
<lb/><fw rend="right">reason</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>reason why they distinguish me so
<lb/>much is the fact that the <term type="tribe">Bakuanis</term>
<lb/>fought bravely. - They have attacked
<lb/>and dispersed eight Tribes during
<lb/>the last ten years and not a
<lb/>single <orgName>boer</orgName> was ever lost by the
<lb/>the hand of a <orgName>Native</orgName>. Having guns
<lb/>and <term type="animal">horses</term> they keep completely out
<lb/>of the way of the <orgName>blacks</orgName>. But
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakuanis</term> managed to kill
<lb/>about thirty five of the <orgName>Boers</orgName>,
<lb/>therefore that <persName>Skellum Dokter</persName> must
<lb/>have taught them. - <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Morton</expan></choice></persName> must
<lb/>try and fancy his Reverence
<lb/>"teaching the young idea how to
<lb/>shoot" <orgName>boers</orgName>, when she thinks of
<lb/><fw rend="right">missionary</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>missionary life in the interior of
<lb/><placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>. I am very much grieved
<lb/>at this outburst on the part of the
<lb/><orgName>Boers</orgName>. I can assert most positively
<lb/>that <persName>Sechele</persName> gave them no cause
<lb/>for offense except that he would
<lb/>not prevent <term type="people">Englishmen</term> from
<lb/>passing him to the north. - They
<lb/>made frequent attempts to induce
<lb/>him to do so, thinking by that
<lb/>means to divert the trade in
<lb/>ivory through their own Territory. -
<lb/>But the path through <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> was discovered in
<lb/>its entire course by <term type="people">Englishmen</term>
<lb/>and they have hitherto carried on
<lb/><fw rend="right">the</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0005" n="0005"/>
<lb/>the trade. - It does not seem
<lb/>right for our <orgName>Government</orgName> to hand 
<lb/>over this path to the <orgName>Boers</orgName>. Previous
<lb/>to my residence at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> there
<lb/>was no trade and petty wars were
<lb/>of frequent occurrence but trade was
<lb/>soon established not only with the
<lb/>tribes in the vicinity of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>but with many in the Countries far
<lb/>beyond. - And if you look at the
<lb/>map you will see that our path
<lb/>runs to the westward of the <placeName><orgName>Boer</orgName> 
<lb/>Territory</placeName>, the nearest point occupied
<lb/>by the <orgName>Boers</orgName> is at least a degree
<lb/>of longitude east of our route. And
<lb/>then this is the only route by which
<lb/><fw rend="right">the</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0006" n="0006"/>
<lb/>the interior of <bloc>Africa</bloc> is open. -
<lb/>The <term type="ailment">fever</term> presents a barrier on
<lb/>almost every other side. One of the
<lb/>Chief objects of my present expedition
<lb/>is to investigate the character of
<lb/>that disease which is the main
<lb/>obstacle to <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> being opened to
<lb/>beneficial intercourse with the rest
<lb/>of the world. - If I can only
<lb/>discover a healthy range of Country
<lb/>and means to foil that terrible
<lb/><term type="ailment">plague</term>, I shall be content to let
<lb/>the <term type="animal">Unicorn</term> <unclear><gap extent="2" unit="chars"/></unclear> sleep in everlasting
<lb/>oblivion. - The blocking up of our
<lb/>path this way only makes me more
<lb/>determined to find out another on

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0007" n="0007"/>
<lb/>either one coast or the other. My
<lb/>detention here has been difficult to
<lb/>bear, but my first hindrances having
<lb/>been the means by which a kind
<lb/>Providence prevented me from falling
<lb/>into the hands of the <orgName>Boers</orgName>, I am
<lb/>encouraged to hope that the present
<lb/>may have been the means by which
<lb/>through God's mercy I may escape
<lb/>being a victim of the <term type="ailment">fever</term>. I have
<lb/>written to <persName>Sir John Pakington</persName> complaining
<lb/>bitterly against the loss of our path
<lb/>and the destruction of my own and
<lb/>the <term type="nationality">English</term> <term type="occupation">hunters</term>' goods which were
<lb/>deposited in my house. - I have not
<lb/>yet got the length of taking
<lb/><fw rend="right">joyfully</fw>

<pb facs="liv_002675_0008" n="0008"/>
<lb/>joyfully the sporting of my goods, -
<lb/>my books were torn to pieces and
<lb/>the leaves scattered to the winds,
<lb/>and the bottles containing medicines
<lb/>all smashed. I would have forgiven
<lb/>them, if they had only taken the
<lb/>property which they could have used, -
<lb/>but having destroyed my medicines
<lb/>and library I feel quite grumpy
<lb/>when I think of a big fat <orgName>Boer</orgName> up
<lb/>lying on my sofa and drinking
<lb/><term type="foodstuff">coffee</term> out of my wife's <term type="foodstuff">coffee</term> pot,
<lb/>Ugh! I suppose <persName>King Pretorius</persName> will
<lb/>write his despatches on my wife's
<lb/>writing desk. Well i hope to get
<lb/>over it in time. I would not grudge
<lb/><fw rend="right">my</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0009" n="0009"/>
<lb/>my losses if the <orgName>Government</orgName> would
<lb/>only secure our path for all who
<lb/>choose to travel it. My house was
<lb/>situated <measure>eight miles</measure> from the Tours 
<lb/>of the plundering of it has nothing
<lb/>to do with their policy to the <orgName>Natives</orgName>.
<lb/>As I am nobody I scarcely expect
<lb/>the <orgName>Government</orgName> will take any notice
<lb/>of the affair.  I hear from <persName>Mr<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>that <persName>Oswell</persName> is already casting a longing eye back to <placeName>><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>I am very sorry that I
<lb/>stupidly left without saying goodbye
<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Morton</persName>. I was somewhat
<lb/>like one of our girls who was quite
<lb/>stupified by the sight of <placeName><settlement type="town">Cape Town</settlement></placeName>
<lb/><fw rend="right">I</fw>

	<pb facs="liv_002675_0010" n="0010"/>
<lb/>I had not all my wits about
<lb/>me. Will you be kind enough to

<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Morton</expan></choice></persName> the girl above mentioned

<lb/>it will be the "perpetual motion"
