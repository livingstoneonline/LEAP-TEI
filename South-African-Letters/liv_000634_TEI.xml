<lb/>of a visit to our friends out here for sometime back - The 
<lb/>chief object I had in view in coming was to attend a meeting
<lb/>of committee - The chief object of my wife seems to have

<lb/>previous to returning to our sphere of labour.  We are glad
<lb/>to hear that your elder sons are so honourably engaged

<lb/>I confess I feel in respect to him a little of what the <term type="people">French</term>

<lb/><p>I have a great desire to place a native teacher in one of
<lb/>the tribes over there - But the distrust with which we are
<lb/>regarded seems misfavourable to the project - the <orgName>emigrants</orgName>
<lb/>lately attacked a large tribe of <term type="tribe">Bagalaka</term> which was situated
<lb/>a little beyond those we visited - To me the affair appears
<lb/>to have been entirely wrong - the most that can be said in defence
<lb/>of the massacre is that information was obtained from other

<lb/>this much about it that you may understand what
<lb/>I shall now state - We went to the <term type="tribe">Bagalaka</term> simply to
<lb/>preach the gospel - We did not go near the tribe which
<lb/>was lately attacked, yet a general impression was made
<lb/><add place="above">among the <orgName>Boers</orgName></add> that our object was to <hi rend="underline">obtain information for the
