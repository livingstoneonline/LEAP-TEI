<lb/><p>After having imagined a sufficient

<lb/><date when="1855-06-15">15<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> June 1855</date> a few days more
<lb/>than a year having elapsed since
<lb/>you wrote it, but it was none the

<lb/>I have been gorging on the papers

<lb/>and letter with sketch from <placeName><settlement type="village">Cabango</settlement></placeName> too
<lb/>I wrote also from the <term type="tribe"><choice><orig>Barotse</orig><reg>Lozi</reg></choice></term> and

<lb/>if it were talking for I believe you
<lb/>will not cavil at defects &amp; have

<lb/>it is not likely they can afford to begin
<lb/>a new mission in an unknown field
<lb/>but wish much to confer with me on
<lb/>the subject. I think they may propose
<lb/>to send me to <placeName><country>China</country></placeName> as this proposal was
<lb/>once entertained since my arrival in
<lb/><placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>, and I see they cannot get
<lb/>suitable men for that inviting field.
<lb/>The practice of medicine &amp; surgery <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">in <placeName><country>China</country></placeName></add> was
<lb/>my own idea of the best way of
<lb/>spending my life and led to my

<lb/>the <term type="nationality">Chinese</term> <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">opium</add> war prevented my being
<lb/>sent there. Knowing (afterwards) my
<lb/>wish my destination was nearly
<lb/>removed from <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> to <placeName><country>China</country></placeName> - but
<lb/>I have now no desire to leave this

<lb/><p>The gentleman to whom you

<lb/>There are not 50 <term type="people">Portuguese</term> in the country
