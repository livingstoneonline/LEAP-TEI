<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>I send this in order to
<lb/>let you know that we have been obliged
<lb/>to alter our plan so far as to leave
<lb/>the Pinnace here in charge of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Baines</persName>
<lb/>We reached <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><orig>Senna</orig><reg>Sena</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> in <measure>four days</measure> being
<lb/>the shortest voyage made though
<lb/>the water is now getting very shoal
<lb/>and we had a whole boat overturned
<lb/>by the paddle <space extent="1" unit="chars"/> <persName>Tom</persName> will &amp; <persName>Peter</persName> moving
<lb/>it aft While we were going though I
<lb/>told them I should stop to allow them
<lb/>to do so - We lost merely the box of 
<lb/>plants &amp; some iron things - The casks
<lb/>floated &amp; were all recovered - <persName>Toby</persName> was
<lb/>nearly carried away by the current
<lb/>he having jumped in to save things
<lb/>and <persName>Tom Jumbo</persName> nobly saved him
<lb/>We spent part of two days at <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><orig>Senna</orig><reg>Sena</reg></choice></settlement></placeName>
<lb/>then came on - with two pilots who
<lb/>have led us into difficulties several
<lb/>times - In going into doubtful places</p>

<cb rend="vertical"/>
<ab>
<lb/><space extent="1" unit="words"/>Should you be desirous of getting away before I come &amp; can arrange 
<lb/>with the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> to take you &amp; a cargo for say £20 or £25 - pray <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> hesitate
</ab> 

	<pb facs="liv_001350_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/><p>It is necessary to go slowly - the Pinnace
<lb/>catches first and the slightest touch makes
<lb/>the Launch <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> her want of power by
<lb/>slewing round - Three times she has done that
<lb/>with me - (<persName>Bedingfeld</persName> did it often) and when
<lb/>she goes a shoal the current keeps her on 
<lb/>and much time is lost.  We heightened the Pinnace
<lb/>as much as possible into the Launch but still
<lb/>she draws so much as to be a great hindrance
<lb/><persName>Baines</persName> volunteered to remain with her and
<lb/>I declined as one of the objects I had in view
<lb/>was to get him up to <placeName><settlement type="town">Tete</settlement></placeName>, but having lost
<lb/>a whole day by <persName>Jumbo</persName> not having the
<lb/>anchor ready when she began to slew round
<lb/>I see is it absolutely necessary to make a
<lb/>trial trip in the Launch first &amp; then when
<lb/>we know the river <choice><sic>take</sic><corr>takes</corr></choice> the Pinnace -
<lb/>Please to speak about these matters to
<lb/><persName>Thornton</persName> only, <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> will chuckle
<lb/>over any of our difficulties and make
<lb/>more of them than any truthful man would
<lb/>He may possibly try by misrepresentation
<lb/>to present our getting any fresh graut
<lb/>for what we shall need.</p>
<lb/><p>As I mention his name I may on
<lb/>this occasion state that <orgName><choice><abbr>H.M.'s</abbr><expan>Her Majesty's</expan></choice> Government</orgName>
<lb/>in order to prevent insubordination such
<lb/>as <persName>Baikie</persName> suffers from in the <placeName><country>Niger</country></placeName> 
<lb/><orgName>Expedition</orgName> invested me with magisterial 
<lb/>power as a <term type="occupation">consul</term> expressly to meet

	<pb facs="liv_001350_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>such a case as <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>'s - I find
<lb/>from the document purporting to be a <bibl>Log</bibl>
<lb/>kept on board the Ma Robert which you
<lb/>delivered to me that he trusts in the power
<lb/>of reiterated assertion to prove my harshness
<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c - I retain the document as evidence
<lb/>and will require you to certify having
<lb/>got it from him as a <bibl>Log</bibl> - for the satisfaction
<lb/>of the <term type="occupation">Foreign Secretary of State</term> - As I
<lb/>must give a full statement of the
<lb/>whole affair to the <orgName>Foreign Office</orgName> I shall
<lb/>require your <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">(medical)</add> evidence as to the state of

<lb/>Ma Robert we found the decks as I <w>con<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-sidered</w> it prejudicial to the health and
<lb/>long before that recommended him to
<lb/>adopt a regular system of cleaning them -
<lb/>As also in respect to his having
<lb/>told you that he had given <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">into</add> me a
<lb/>second resignation, and as you are
<lb/>now the second in command your
<lb/>opinion expressed to me when I
<lb/><choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> you my acceptance of that
<lb/>resignation that it was absolutly
<lb/>necessary to save the <orgName>Expedition</orgName>
<lb/>from complete disorganization
<lb/>or words to that effect would prove

	<pb facs="liv_001350_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>of no ordinary value to the <term type="occupation">Foreign Secretary</term>
<lb/>from an impartial witness, for whom alone
<lb/>the evidence is required - It goes to him direct
<lb/>and is not published - As <persName><choice><abbr>B.</abbr><expan>Bedingfeld</expan></choice></persName> seems disposed
<lb/>to make something out by your signing a
<lb/>paper I think it would be well to state
<lb/>also how much he asked &amp; how much
<lb/>you meant in doing so.  He refers to it
<lb/>in <bibl>two documents</bibl> - I am not conscious

<lb break="no"/>-duct</w> nor have I been quarrelsome with

<lb/><orgName>Foreign Office</orgName> I do so with extreme regret
<lb/>and sorrow that public duty requires it
<lb/>to be done against any of our number
<lb/>I earnestly hope &amp; pray that nothing may
