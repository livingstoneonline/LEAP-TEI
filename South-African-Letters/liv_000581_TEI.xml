<lb/>came safely to hand and like everything from home
<lb/>partook of the nature of cold water to a thirsty
<lb/>soul, they were really very good (but shall
<lb/>I tell their <w>faul<subst><del>s</del><add place="over-text">t</add></subst>s</w>) they were really very short

<lb/>give a refreshing draught and then though
<lb/>I thank you now for the little I shall be
<lb/>much more cordial in my acknowledgements
<lb/>for the more.</p>
<lb/><p>All things work together for good. Can
<lb/>anything be better than that? this affliction
<lb/>you refer to I think has, one soon becomes
<lb/>inured to danger. When I left you I am sure
<lb/>the hair on my head would have stood
<lb/>on end at the sight of a <term type="animal">serpent</term> in my
<lb/>path <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>But as residence among such
<lb/>dangers takes away the dread. We become
<lb/>familiar with what would have shocked
<lb/>us before - (may I never become so with sin)
<lb/>Well I had experienced so many instances
<lb/>of merciful preservation, such as escaping 
<lb/>from dangerous animals although no
    
    <pb facs="liv_000581_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>means had been taken for preservation I became

<lb/>ascend behind some rocks towards our people 
<lb/>&amp; was as near to them as you at your desk
<lb/>are to <persName>Mr. Arundel</persName> at his. I ran forward to 
<lb/>be within reach of call &amp; warn them of their
<lb/>eminent danger, the animal did them
<lb/>no harm I then rushed to draw them away
<lb/>home &amp; in doing so came round by the end 
<lb/>of the hill close to the wounded animal. the

<lb/>the animal sprung from me upon him<!-- animal: lion -->

<lb/>by as that time pitching his spear into the <choice><sic>monsters</sic><corr>monster's</corr></choice>
<lb/>heart. this was the fifth they had killed within
<lb/>a short time. I walked home without assistance
<lb/>the <orgName>natives</orgName> <unclear cert="medium">cut</unclear> were carried. The excessive discharge
<lb/>however soon reduced me to a skeleton &amp; there
