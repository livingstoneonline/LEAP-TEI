<lb/>lately gave me another daughter in the shape of a young <foreign xml:lang="und" ref="foreign-word.xml#0014"><term type="animal">Soko</term></foreign> or <term type="animal"><choice><orig>gorillah</orig><reg>gorilla</reg></choice></term> - she
<lb/>sits crouching 18 inches high and is most intelligent and least mischievous of
<lb/>all the <term type="animal">monkeys</term> I have seen - she holds out her hand to be lifted up &amp; carried and if
<lb/>refused makes her face as in a bitter human weeping and wrings her hands quite
<lb/>humanly sometimes adding a foot or third hand to make the appeal more touching
<lb/>she walks by putting the backs of the four fingers on the ground - the space leaned

<lb/>upright - a nasty fellow spat in her face she resented this bitterly and wiped the face with
<lb/>a piece of <term type="plant_foodstuff">banana leaf</term> - she loosed her cord in <unclear cert="high">quite</unclear> a business way using the thumbs
<lb/>opposed to the fingers not <term type="animal">monkey</term> fashion with fingers above and when one

<lb/>always placed her back to me for safety - came &amp; sat on my mat - decently made
<lb/>a nest of grass &amp; leaves &amp; covered herself with the mat to sleep = I could not take
<lb/>her with me though I fear that she will die before I return from people plaguing her
<lb/>Her fine long black hair was beautiful when tended by her mother who was killed
<lb/>It is now disheveled - I am mobbed enough alone - two <foreign xml:lang="und" ref="foreign-word.xml#0014"><term type="animal"><choice><orig>sokos</orig><reg>Sokos</reg></choice></term></foreign> - she &amp; I would not
<lb/>have got breath - I have to submit to be a gazing stock - I don't altogether relish
<lb/>here or elsewhere but try to get over it good naturedly - get into the most shady spot
<lb/>of the village and <choice><orig>leizurely</orig><reg>leisurely</reg></choice> look at all my admirers - When the first crowd begins
<lb/>to go away I go into my lodging to take what food may be prepared as <term type="plant_foodstuff">coffee</term> when
<lb/>I have it or roasted <unclear cert="medium"><term type="plant_foodstuff">maize</term>d</unclear> infusion when I have none - the door is shut
<lb/>all save a space to admit light - It is made of the inner bark of a gigantic tree
<lb/>not a quarter of an inch thick and slides in a groove behind a post on each side
<lb/>of the doorway - When partially open it is supported by only one of the posts =
<lb/>Eager heads sometimes crowd the open space and crash goes the thin door landing
<lb/>a <term type="tribe" ref="ethnic-group.xml#0010">Manyema</term> beauty on the floor - "It was not I" she gasps out "It was <persName ref="people.xml#0018">Bessie

<lb/>To avoid darkness or being half smothered I often eat in public - <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>draw a

<lb/>do in <placeName><region ref="region.xml#0013">Manyema</region></placeName>, the lady of the house brings water wood, and bless their motherly

<lb/>with <term type="plant_foodstuff">bananas</term> are their best - They seem distressed if refused - a woman with

<lb/>she enjoined "you are ill &amp; weak only through hunger"; I am always sorry if I
<lb/>cannot take a mouthful or two - Many of the <orgName><term type="tribe" ref="ethnic-group.xml#0010">Manyema</term> women</orgName> are very

<lb/>me sick at heart - It is not <orgName>slave trade</orgName> it is murdering <orgName>free people</orgName> to make <orgName>slaves</orgName>
<lb/>It is perfectly indescribable - <persName ref="people.xml#0071">Kirk</persName> has been working hard to get this murderous system
<lb/>put a stop <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">to</add>. Heaven prosper his noble efforts - He says in <bibl>one letter to me</bibl> it is <w>mon<unclear cert="high">str</unclear>ous</w>

<lb/>as his custom is, had bitten off the ends of two fingers &amp; two toes - He got clear off

<lb/>up a tree with a <orgName>native</orgName> child - The women in these cases run for a bunch of
<lb/>small <term type="plant_foodstuff">bananas</term> - He takes these &amp; leaves the child - In the forest he is seen walking
<lb/>sometimes with his hands on his <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">head</add> - To me he is a potbellied bandy legged low looking
<lb/>villain without a particle of the gentleman in him - His ugliness after
