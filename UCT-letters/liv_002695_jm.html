<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">                                        </span>In consequence of the total inability
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of <span class="">Mr Hamilton</span> to handle his pen, I write the following
<br/>information at his dictation. He has been laid
<br/>on a bed of sickness for more than twelve months
<br/>and his bodily powers have during the greater portion
<br/>of that time been completely prostrate - <span class="space">  </span>He was
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>first affected by disease in the bowels. This
<br/>produced extreme prostration and after being 
<br/>bedridden during many months the return
<br/>of strength has been so very slow - <span class="space">  </span>the
<br/>most he can do is to crawl to the
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>church on Sundays by means of two
<br/>crutches. <span class="space">      </span>His eyesight is so far impaired
<br/>he cannot read the largest print, and but
<br/>for the unwearied attentions of <span class="">Mr</span> and
<br/><span class="">Mrs Moffat</span> his situation would have
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>been far from comfortable. He desires
<br/>me to express his gratitude to them for their
    
    <span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>kind care &amp; watchfulness over him both by day
<br/>and by night. <span class="space">  </span><span class="">Mr Moffat</span> could not have done
<br/>more though he had been his own brother nor
<br/><span class="">Mrs Moffat</span> though she had been his sister. May

<br/>and separation of himself and <span class="">Mrs Hamilton</span> has
<br/>been mysterious but <span class="del cancelled">probably</span> perhaps it will
<br/>appear well in the end.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">A pious American Captain called <span class="">Holmes</span>

<br/>of the latter may have a beneficial influence
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and this might be a convenient person to
