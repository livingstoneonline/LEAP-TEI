<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="space">                                        </span><span class="space">  </span>I take the liberty
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of placing before you a short account
<br/>of our proceedings since I last
<br/>addressed your predecessor <span class="">Admiral
<br/>Sir Henry Keppel</span>, and of thanking
<br/>you for most important services
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>rendered to us by your direction
<br/>by <span class="">Captain Wilson</span> of H.M.S.
<br/>Gorgon.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">On reaching the Elephant
<br/>marsh about <span class="">30 miles</span> below the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>cataracts of the <span class="">Shire</span> in June last
    
    <span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>year we found that the river <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">shoaled</span>
<br/>to about <span class="">four feet</span> in consequence
<br/>of a number of branches passing off
<br/>from the main stream. Anxious
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to place the ship in a healthy locality
<br/>we <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">warped</span> her up to within <span class=""/> 
<br/>miles of the cataracts and feeling
<br/>that we could <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">not</span> well leave the bishop's
<br/>mission without introducing him
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to the people, we accompanied him
<br/>by a few days march up to the
<br/><span class=""><span class="">Manganja highlands</span></span>  East of the
<br/><span class="">Shire</span> cataracts. When we had just
<br/>passed over the brow of the first
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>plateau we met a party of <span class="">Tette</span>
<br/><span class="">slaves</span> driving 84 captives before
<br/>them. They had followed <span class=""/> <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: high">the</span>
<br/>footsteps of our discoveries and
<br/><span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">got</span> up a system of <span class="">slave</span> hunting
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>in the very country to which
    
    <span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>to which the mission had come, and of which
<br/>they had no previous knowledge,
<br/>by employing one tribe called
<br/>Ajawa to attack another named
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Maganja - kill the men and
<br/>sell the women and children to
<br/>them. I was doubtful how to
<br/>act at first, but while making
<br/>enquiries among the captives,
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Portuguese <span class="">slaves</span> decamped
<br/>into the forest. We <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">herded</span> the
<br/>captives of this and three other
<br/>parties over to the bishop. For
<br/>one of these we went several
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>miles out of our way, and
<br/>hearing of a fifth party with
<br/>over one hundred captives,
<br/><span class="">Dr Kirk</span> was sent back to
<br/>intercept them in crossing the

    <span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>river. His movement failed but
<br/>a body of men with about ninety
<br/>muskets, and headed by a white
<br/>Portuguese from <span class="">Tette</span>, was deterred
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>from joining the Ajawa by hearing
<br/>of <span class="">Dr Kirk</span>'s return to the ship.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We found the Maganja all
<br/>fleeing from the Ajawa and believing
<br/>that we could induce them to
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>desist from murdering the Maganja
<br/>we went to hold a conference.
<br/>We <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">reached</span> them about <span class="">12 miles</span>
<br/>from the mission station, and 
<br/>found them in the act of burning
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>three villages. Unfortunately our
<br/>professions of having come
<br/>peaceably were neutralized by
<br/>some Maganja followers calling
<br/>out "our <span class="">Chibisa</span> is come". This
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span><span class="">Chibisa</span> is believed to have <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">audiences</span>
    
    <span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>capable of ensuring victory. I heard
<br/>the words distinctly but it never
<br/>struck my mind till afterwards that
<br/>they were neutralizing our professions
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and depriving us of the protection 
<br/>of our English name. The 
<br/>Ajawa attacked us with four muskets
<br/>and many poisoned arrows
<br/>and forced us to drive them off
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>with our firearms. A matter
<br/>for which I am very sorry, as I
<br/>never had a hostile encounter
<br/>with the natives before.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We then left returned to
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the ship and carried a boat
<br/>past the cataracts of the <span class="">Shire</span>
<br/>there are five cataracts in 35'
<br/>of Latitude of <span class="">100 or 150 feet</span>
<br/>each, the whole descent amounts
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to <span class="">1200 feet</span>, and when we

    <span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>launched the boat above the upper
<br/>-most cataract we were virtually
<br/>on the <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span> or <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low"><span class="">Nyinyesi</span></span>
<br/>because the upper <span class="">Shire</span> is all
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>smooth and deep. There are <span class="">sixty
<br/>miles</span> of five gently flowing <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">rivers</span>
<br/><span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">above</span> the cataracts, and a lakelet
<br/><span class="">10 or 12 miles</span> long and <span class="">5 or 6</span> broad.
<br/>We sailed into the Lake on the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">2<span class="sup ">d</span> September</span> and followed the
<br/>Western Shore. It is a very deep
<br/>body of water, our sounding line
<br/>of <span class="">35 fathoms</span> often shewed no
<br/>bottom at a mile from the shore
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and in the North no bottom
<br/>was found at <span class="">116 fathoms</span>. The
<br/>Lake is from <span class="">18 or 20 to 50 or 60 
<br/>miles</span> broad but we could not
<br/>cross to measure accurately, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>It was very stormy when we
<br/>were there and being encircled
    
    <span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>by mountains and highlands,
<br/>tremendous seas for an open
<br/>boat get up in 15 or 20 minutes,
<br/>the length is over <span class="">200 miles</span>.
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>The shape is an approach to the
<br/>Boot shape of <span class="">Italy</span>. We were
<br/>forced to return by want of
<br/>food without going round the
<br/>Northern end. War had raged
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>there and the country was
<br/>depopulated by a tribe of Zulus
<br/>originally from the South,
<br/>so we were obliged to come
<br/>back without finding out
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>about the <span class="">Rovuma</span>. The 
<br/>chief object of our exploration
<br/>on the western shore one man
<br/>would tell us that we might
<br/>sail out of the Lake into the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>river. Another that we must
    
    <span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/><span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">carry</span> the boat a few yards. Another
<br/>would declare that she must be
<br/>carried <span class="">fifty miles</span> or a hundred
<br/>on one point alone did all agree
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>namely, that <span class="">Rovuma</span> is a very
<br/>large river. We must confess
<br/>however that we returned just
<br/>about as wise as we went after
<br/>a three months absence from the
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>ship.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I beg leave to call your attention
<br/>to the opinion of <span class="">Colonel Rigby</span> that
<br/>of 19,000 <span class="">slaves</span> which pass annually
<br/>through the custom house of
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="">Zanzibar</span>, the chief portion comes
<br/>from <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span>, and the
<br/>valley of the <span class="">Shire</span>; and that should
<br/>it ever be possible to place a
<br/>steamer on the Lake the trade
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>would be repressed. Without
<br/>knowing this opinion we have
<br/>been working with a view
    
    <span class="pb-title">0009</span>
<br/>to <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">carrying</span> into effect his proposition
<br/>with respect to the placing a steamer
<br/>on the Lake. Our hopes can
<br/>scarcely be realized unless in addition
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to a steamer on the Lake we have
<br/>an outlet to the <span class="">three hundred
<br/>miles</span> of cotton field which in
<br/>the upper <span class="">Shire</span>, and <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span>
<br/>we have opened up. It must be
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>beyond Portuguese claims, and
<br/><span class="">Rovuma</span> seems to be best adapted
<br/>for the object. The Portuguese 
<br/>watch every step we take and the
<br/>Government by lately building
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>a port at the mouth of the <span class="">Shire</span>
<br/>intends to enrich itself by dues
<br/>from the cotton trade, while
<br/><span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: high">in</span> <span class="">Tette</span> merchants headed by
<br/>the Governor depopulates the
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>country from which the trade is
<br/>to come by <span class="">slave</span> hunting.</p>
    
    <span class="pb-title">0010</span>
<br/><p class="p ">The movement of the Governor
<br/>General of <span class="">Mosambique</span> to induce
<br/><span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">the</span> Sultan of <span class="">Zanzibar</span> to cede the
<br/><span class="">Rovuma</span> to him is just of a
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>piece with all their policy. They
<br/>are intensely anxious to be
<br/>enriched by English enterprise, &amp;
<br/>without an outlet away from
<br/>them we cannot invite English
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>merchants into the country.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We shall be unable to do anything
<br/>about <span class="">Rovuma</span> during twelve months
<br/>in which we shall be carrying
<br/>the steamer past the cataracts. It
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>is extremely desirable that the
<br/>new cotton field should be
<br/>opened during the present com-
<br/>-plications of affairs in <span class="">America</span>.
<br/>I feel diffident in <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">venturing</span> to
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>suggest anything to you but
    
    <span class="pb-title">0011</span>
<br/>remembering the important influence
<br/><span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: high">that</span> free access of Englishmen
<br/>into the country will have on
<br/>the <span class="">Nyassa</span> <span class="">slave</span> trade, I hope
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>you will bear with me in
<br/>proposing the exploration of the
<br/><span class="">Rovuma</span> in boats from the sea
<br/>upwards. Avoiding the months
<br/>when the river is low, probably
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>June July August September &amp; October
<br/>The work might be quickly per-
<br/>-formed especially if committed
<br/>to a man so well acquainted
<br/>with the coast and so energetic
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>as <span class="">Captain Wilson</span>. The service
<br/>to this Expedition and to the
<br/>objects which we have in
<br/>common in relation to the <span class="">slave</span>
<br/>trade. To my mind all that is
    
    <span class="pb-title">0012</span>
<br/>wanting to complete the success of
<br/>our undertaking is a steamer on the
<br/>Lake and a road out to the sea
<br/>coast free to Englishmen. Being
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>very anxious that the latter object
<br/>should be secured while we are
<br/>busy with the former I hope you
<br/>excuse me in saying so much</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have now to thank you
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>for your kind consideration in
<br/>instructing <span class="">Captain Wilson</span> to render
<br/>us assistance, and I can soberly
<br/>assure you that I feel more
<br/>grateful for his services than I
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>can express. He brought the 
<br/>having the steamer "Lady of the Lake"
<br/>on board from <span class="">Mosambique</span> to <span class="">Kongone</span>
<br/>and put the principal pieces into the
<br/>Pioneer in a week. A work that
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>would have cost us a month if
<br/>we could have accomplished it
<br/>at all. I feel very thankful for
    
    <span class="pb-title">0013</span>
<br/>he has done everthing he could
<br/>in the most frank &amp; obliging
<br/>manner possible.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">On another point I feel inclined
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to say very little but am sure
<br/>that you would not fully
<br/>understand matters up here
<br/>if I kept silence. The bishop
<br/>informed us that during
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>our absence at <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span>
<br/>he had gone about <span class="">15 miles</span>
<br/>and attacked another tribe
<br/>of Ajawas - burned their
<br/>town and drove them away
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>We took 2 men of wars' men
<br/>and our Engineer whom
<br/>I had sent up for the sake
<br/>of change of air after being
    
    <span class="pb-title">0014</span>
<br/>much reduced by fever. They remembered
<br/>after they had gone that I had given
<br/>no orders to them to fight and I
<br/>excuse them on account of the
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>portion of the gentlemen who
<br/>asked them to go. I never
<br/>contemplated the missionary
<br/>doing anything in the offensive
<br/>and indeed told the natives before
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>leaving that the white men
<br/>would never engage in their
<br/>quarrels or fight unless
<br/>attacked as we were. I disapprove
<br/>of the missionaries fighting at
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>all except in self defence, but
<br/>am not very sure what I ought
<br/>to do to prevent it. I apply by
<br/>this mail to the Government
<br/>for advice on the point. I
    
    <span class="pb-title">0015</span>
<br/>regret very much that by going
<br/>to try and secure a peaceful
<br/>settlement for them I became
<br/>in a measure mixed up with it.</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">We left our small boat
<br/>hoisted up to a shady tree above
<br/>the uppermost cataract. We
<br/>have one <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">gig</span> only and very
<br/>much <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">shattered</span> by the work it
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>has done in laying out <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">anchors</span> &amp;c
<br/>May I beg a strong cutter <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">gig</span>
<br/>from the dock yard?</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="">Captain Wilson</span> will inform
<br/>you that he could give us but
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>very few provisions. We shall
<br/>therefore trust to you for a
<br/>supply of all sorts of common
<br/>provisions at your earliest
<br/>convenience.</p>
     
    <span class="pb-title">0016</span>
<br/><p class="p ">We shall come down to the <span class="">Kongone</span>
<br/>sometime in March and again
<br/>in April next.</p>
