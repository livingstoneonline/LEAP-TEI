<lb/><p>In consequence of the total inability
<lb/>of <persName>Mr Hamilton</persName> to handle his pen, I write the following
<lb/>information at his dictation. He has been laid
<lb/>on a bed of sickness for more than twelve months
<lb/>and his bodily powers have during the greater portion
<lb/>of that time been completely prostrate. He was
<lb/>first affected by disease in the bowels. This
<lb/>produced extreme prostration and after being 
<lb/>bedridden during many months the return
<lb/>of strength has been so very slow. The
<lb/>most he can do is to crawl to the
<lb/>church on Sundays by means of two
<lb/>crutches. His eyesight is so far impaired
<lb/>he cannot read the largest print, and but
<lb/>for the unwearied attentions of <persName>Mr and
<lb/>Mrs Moffat</persName> his situation would have
<lb/>been far from comfortable. He desires
<lb/>me to express his gratitude to them for their
    
    <pb facs="liv_002695_0002.jpg" n="0002"/>
<lb/>kind care &amp; watchfulness over him both by day
<lb/>and by night. <persName>Mr Moffat</persName> could not have done
<lb/>more though he had been his own brother not
<lb/><persName>Mrs Moffat</persName> though she had been his sister. May
<lb/>God reward them. He adds that the union
<lb/>and separation of himself and <persName>Mrs Hamilton</persName> has
<lb/>been mysterious but <del type="strikethrough">probably</del> perhaps it will
<lb/>appear well in the end.</p>
<lb/><p>A pious <term type="people">American</term> <term type="occupation">Captain</term> called <persName>Holmes</persName>
<lb/>trades regularly to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>. It appears desirable
<lb/>that <persName>Mr Hamilton</persName>'s son be made aware of the
<lb/>circumstance, for if he would introduce
<lb/>himself to the <term type="occupation">Captain</term> the pious conversation
<lb/>of the latter may have a beneficial influence
<lb/>and this might be a convenient person to
<lb/>whose care <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>H</abbr><expan>Hamilton</expan></choice></persName>'s watch might be
<lb/>entrusted. He intends to leave it to
<lb/>his son. If you know your sons
<lb/>address in <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName> please communicate
<lb/>the above information.</p>
<lb/><p>He desires me to inform you that <persName>Mary Moffat</persName>
<lb/>the wife of <persName>Mr Livingston</persName> is at present here
    
    <pb facs="liv_002695_0003.jpg" n="0003"/>
<lb/>she has three children. And her sister <persName>Ann Moffat</persName>
<lb/>is married to the <term type="people">French</term> <term type="occupation">missionary</term> of <placeName><settlement type="village">Motito</settlement></placeName>
<lb/><persName>Revd <choice><abbr>J</abbr><expan>Jean</expan></choice> Fredoux</persName>. Old <persName>Majima</persName> is still alive
<lb/>A queer old woman. <persName>Mr Hamilton</persName> presented her
<lb/>with a <term type="animal">cow</term> lately, and it was with difficulty
<lb/>she could be induced to thank him for it
<lb/>She does not seem to care much for any one
<lb/>else in the world except herself. If you saw
<lb/>her she might interest you for however
<lb/>the other members may fail her tongue is
<lb/>as supple as ever. All your other friends
<lb/>are gone off to the interior. And there it is
<lb/>probable they will have enough to do. <gap extent="4" unit="chars" agent="blot"></gap>
<lb/>keep at peace with their neighbours and
<lb/>enemies the <term type="people">Boers</term></p>
<lb/><p>Although <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>H</abbr><expan>Hamilton</expan></choice></persName> cannot write you may for
<lb/>if spared he will always be happy
<lb/>to hear from his friends</p>
