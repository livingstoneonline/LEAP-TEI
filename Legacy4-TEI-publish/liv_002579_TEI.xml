<lb/><p>My Dear Sir </p>
<lb/><p>On reaching this place in 
<lb/>1869 I found your very kind and welcome 
<lb/>present of Assam tea and as I had 
<lb/>tasted neither tea coffee nor sugar for 
<lb/>two years and six months you may be 
<lb/>sure that I blessed you for your kind 
<lb/>remembrance. I was greatly reduced 
<lb/>by an attack of pneumonia and I 
<lb/>think that the renewal of my strength 
<lb/>was in a great measure owing to copious 
<lb/>libations of the delicious beverage - native 
<lb/>food is generally coarse though the 
<lb/>people shew a great deal of ingenuity 
<lb/>in making it as fine and as <choice><sic>palateable</sic><corr>palatable</corr></choice>
<lb/>as possible but after all our systems 
<lb/>require European food if we are 
<lb/>to retain health and strength. I wrote 
<lb/>a note of thanks in May of /69 but my 
<lb/>packet of letters was destroyed between 
<lb/>this and the sea. I therefore feel that you 
<lb/>have set me down as ungrateful 
<lb/>and I write this in order that you 
<lb/>may see that I am really greatly obliged 
<lb/>and that I am very unwilling that 
<lb/>you should have good reason to think 
<lb/>I had forgotten my benefactor<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I have been a great deal longer 
<lb/>at my work of exploration than I 
<lb/>ever expected - the sources of the 
<lb/><placeName>Nile</placeName> are not a little matter that one 
<lb/>might reach - scream out Hurrah! 
<lb/>and go away home: the watershed 
<lb/>from which the springs of the <placeName>Nile</placeName> do 
<lb/>unquestionable arise is full 700 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002579_0002"/><!--pb/@n='02'-->
<lb/>seven hundred miles in length from West 
<lb/>to East and the springs in some parts I 
<lb/>passed over are like the vegetation of frost 
<lb/>on window panes - almost innumerable 
<lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>they</corr></choice> converge into enormous Lake rivers 
<lb/>the central one of which is from one 
<lb/>to three miles broad and it can 
<lb/>never be waded at any point or 
<lb/>at any time of the year - ultimately 
<lb/>the two Western rivers fall into the 
<lb/>central one and then we have in 
<lb/>it and <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> with the lake 
<lb/>river <placeName>Albert Nyanza</placeName> but two 
<lb/>main drains of the great <placeName>Nile</placeName>
<lb/>valley as was depicted by Ptolemy<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have been trying to follow the 
<lb/>central lake <unclear cert="low">even</unclear> down through 
<lb/>the country of the cannibals 
<lb/>named Manyema - it has four 
<lb/>large lakes proper in its course<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he country is fertile beyond 
<lb/>description and the population 
<lb/>prodigious - were never visited 
<lb/>before and the ivory lies in 
<lb/>the forests where the animals 
<lb/>were killed - this has brought 
<lb/>swarms of half caste traders 
<lb/>into Manyema and not content 
<lb/>with ivory sufficient to acquire 
<lb/>to be carried by three relays they must 
<lb/>needs murder and make slaves. 
<lb/>It is not slave trading it is simply 
<lb/>marauding &amp; murder and all that 
<lb/>slaving privileges of the <persName>Sultan of 
<lb/>Zanzibar</persName> should not suffer - 
<lb/>Kindest salaams to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Black</persName>
<lb/>from yours &amp;c <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
