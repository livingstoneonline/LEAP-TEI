<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Tette</placeName> 30<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> 1860 </p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Sir George</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I have been very far from 
<lb/>forgetful of your kindness, though you have 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> no evidence of my remembrance since 
<lb/>I came back to <placeName>Africa</placeName> - but you know the sort 
<lb/>of life an Explorer leads and will be disposed to make 
<lb/>allowances. </p>
<lb/><p>We have just come off a trip of about 1400 
<lb/>miles. We went up this river to the country of the 
<lb/><placeName>Makololo</placeName> travelling along the North bank on foot 
<lb/>and returning partly in canoes and partly on foot 
<lb/>by nearly the same track. We had thus a good 
<lb/>opportunity of examining the whole river at <del type="strikethrough">dr</del>
<lb/>low water and saw about a hundred miles 
<lb/>of it which the tsetse prevented me from seeing 
<lb/>in 1855. We crossed the <placeName>Kafue</placeName> at its confluence 
<lb/>and went along the fine fertile valley in which 
<lb/>the river gently flows among a people who 
<lb/>may all be called <term type="tribe">Bat<hi rend="above">o</hi>ka</term> though each small tribe 
<lb/>has its own name besides. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey were 
<lb/>remarkably hospitable and being in the habit 
<lb/>of cultivating the ground extensively they had 
<lb/>plenty of food to bestow. They cultivate great 
<lb/>quantities of very fine cotton too though the 
<lb/>men go stark naked. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he women have more 
<lb/>sense and go decently covered. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir country 
<lb/>is well furnished with coal - many rivulets 
<lb/>contain fragments of the precious mineral 
<lb/>but none knew that it would burn. We saw two fine large seams in the bank 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001604_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> from which steamers will one 
<lb/>day be loaded - for the river above <placeName>Chicova</placeName>
<lb/>is finer i.e. more navigable than below 
<lb/><placeName>Tette</placeName> and <placeName>Lupata</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>On a second visit to the falls of <placeName>Victoria</placeName>
<lb/>about which you shewed a kind interest. I 
<lb/>am inclined to say that they are the most 
<lb/>wonderful in the world. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he breadth is not 1000 
<lb/>yards as I conjectured but between one statute 
<lb/>and one geographical mile we say 1860 yards 
<lb/>though it is a little more, by way of assisting 
<lb/>the memory. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he depth is not 1000 <add place="above">feet</add> as I stated 
<lb/>but 310 feet and even now at extreme 
<lb/>low water there were 800 feet of water falling<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>After leaping sheer down 310 feet it is collected 
<lb/>from both ends of the fizzure to the escape 
<lb/>which being nearer the North than South 
<lb/>bank is like the letter <figure><!--<graphic url="LETT1149-1.gif"/>--><figDesc/></figure> but come to the 
<lb/>other or Eastern side of the crack and you 
<lb/>find it prolonged in the most wonderful 
<lb/>zigzag manner. If you will excuse the 
<lb/>following it may convey my meaning 
<lb/>the promontories formed by the zigzag 
<lb/>are of the same height as the bed <figure><!--<graphic style="float:right" url="LETT1149-2.gif"/>--><figDesc/></figure> of the river 
<lb/>above the Falls - they <add place="above">are</add> flat &amp; covered with trees 
<lb/>but the sides are perpendicular and you 
<lb/>in walking along their tops can see 
<lb/>the river some 300 feet 
<lb/>below jammed in a 
<lb/>space of 20 or 30 yards 
<lb/>the base of one promontory is only 560 paces 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001604_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>and of another 400. The river being very low 
<lb/>we could see clearly the bottom of one half of 
<lb/>the full fizzure. The columns of vapour 
<lb/>were smaller than when I was there in 
<lb/>/55 - but still very high as we saw them 
<lb/>distinctly at a distance of 20′. And this 
<lb/>wonderful water fall exists in what we 
<lb/>were all thought to believe were interminable 
<lb/>plains of burning barren sand where 
<lb/>the most enterprising rivers ran only 
<lb/>to be lost. </p>
<lb/><p>We found it hot enough on our return 
<lb/>though in going we climbed up to the Highlands 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Batoka</placeName> and saw hoar frost and 
<lb/>a little ice. The soil becomes disagreeably 
<lb/>hot even for <add place="above">a person with</add> shoes. 136° at 3 P.M. 
<lb/>and a thermometer in the shade of the body 
<lb/>when marching is often over 100°. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>blood even becomes hotter than that of 
<lb/>the natives 99° 1/2 while the natives shew 98° 
<lb/>but the most remarkable feature in the 
<lb/>climate was the rate of evaporation 
<lb/>there was often a difference of 33°- 36° 
<lb/>and even 40° between the wet and dry bulbs<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>In meeting with our old friends the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term> we were grieved to find that 
<lb/>many of them had died of fever and 
<lb/>indeed if they are not permitted to 
<lb/>remove from their unhealthy swamps 
<lb/>soon they will break up as a tribe. 
<lb/>A party of missionaries had 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001604_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>suffered severely from the same 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>plaint.</w><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir loss makes me value 
<lb/>a remedy rather highly which I have found 
<lb/>quite effectual in curing the disease ever 
<lb/>since 1850 - but I do not like to 
<lb/>make a fuss about it as I would 
<lb/>look as we medical people say 
<lb/>Quackish. We have however enjoyed 
<lb/>good opportunities for testing it during 
<lb/>this Expedition. </p>
<lb/><p>Your knife is my constant companion 
<lb/>and it has often brought you vividly 
<lb/>to my recollection. Please present 
<lb/>my kindest remembrances to 
<lb/><persName>Lady Back</persName> and believe me<reg>.</reg></p>
