<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>River Shire</placeName> 9<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> 1861 </p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hooker</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Many thanks for your 
<lb/>kind letter by the Pioneer. We had just 
<lb/>returned from the <placeName>Makololo country</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>contemplated a long run up the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>so I thought it would be as well to wait 
<lb/>before answering you till I had something 
<lb/>to write about. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk </persName>wished to 
<lb/>go home as by the <placeName>Victoria fall</placeName> journey 
<lb/>he had pretty well worked up the 
<lb/>botany of a large section of the country 
<lb/>but when he heard of a new steamer 
<lb/>and a new field up <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> he 
<lb/>was willing enough to stay - We failed 
<lb/>at the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> chiefly because the 
<lb/>new vessel is too deep - then came 
<lb/>round to the <placeName>Shire</placeName> intending to examine 
<lb/>the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> from above downwards 
<lb/>and have again failed. We carried a 
<lb/>boat past the <placeName>cataracts</placeName> then sailed 
<lb/>about 60 miles up the <placeName>Upper Shire - </placeName>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001704_0002"/><!--pb/@n='179a'--> 
<lb/>and some 225 up the Lake. We found it 
<lb/>very deep - and from 20 to 50 miles broad<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he length is that above indicated though 
<lb/>we say only over 200 miles. The country 
<lb/>around is all highland or mountainous 
<lb/>and sudden storms come down which 
<lb/>raise seas in which no open boat could 
<lb/>live. We were there during the Equinoctial 
<lb/>gales and it would have been 
<w>foolhardi-<lb break="no"/>ness</w> to have crossed to the Eastern shore 
<lb/>at that period. When we came to near 
<lb/>the North end, or where the people go 
<lb/>round it, no food was to be had, and 
<lb/>wherever we went we saw skeletons 
<lb/>and putrid bodies of the slain the handiwork 
<lb/>of a tribe of Zulus called <term type="tribe">Mazita</term> or 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Mazite</term>. I met seven of them and they 
<lb/>were as much afraid of me as I ought 
<lb/>to have been of them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey would not 
<lb/>take me to their chief. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he country was 
<lb/>depopulated so we were obliged to return 
<lb/>and be content with the most contradictory 
<lb/>reports of Rovuma ever heard. One man 
<lb/>of intelligence and with no motive we 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001704_0003"/><!--pb/@n='179b'--> 
<lb/>could imagine for deception, would 
<lb/>assert positively that we could sail out 
<lb/>of the Lake into the river - Another would 
<lb/>say we must lift it <add place="above">(the boat)</add> a mile - another 
<lb/>fifty miles - a fourth a hundred &amp; 
<lb/>in one point alone did all agree it was 
<lb/>"a very large river". The reason why 
<lb/>we want an outlet there is the Portuguese 
<lb/>follow us everywhere and introduce 
<lb/>slaving. When we took the bishop 
<lb/>up to a spot about 15 miles south 
<lb/>of <placeName>Zomba</placeName> we met Portuguese slavers 
<lb/>returning from near that mountain 
<lb/>with lots of captives - we took them &amp; 
<lb/>gave them over to the bishop to be 
<lb/>operated on by His Reverence 
<w>secund-<lb break="no"/>em</w> Artem high Churchii. <addSpan spanTo="#p179b-3" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fol. 179b-3'--></addSpan>If you are high church you had better rub out that 
<lb/>bit of profanity!<anchor xml:id="p179b-3"/> We have 
<lb/>plenty of cotton for the collecting but 
<lb/>no Englishman will submit to 
<lb/>Portuguese officials. We shall be 
<lb/>engaged for the best part of a year 
<lb/>in carrying a steamer past the 
<lb/>cataracts. We expect her soon and 
<lb/>the parts to be screwed together. </p>

<lb/><p><persName>Kirk</persName> will tell you about the palm oil nut 
<lb/>found on the Lake. It is not half the size of that 
<lb/>on the West coast &amp; is not used for anything<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It cannot be of any value for they collect 
<lb/>an insect not bigger than our smallest 
<lb/>gnat and boil them into cakes which are 
<lb/>used as a relish with other food. I expect 
<lb/>some of the real nut from <placeName>Loanda</placeName> for planting. </p>
<lb/><p>I am very glad to hear that you are 
<lb/>going to bring out a Genera Plantarum 
<lb/>we have often talked about &amp; felt 
<lb/>angry that you did not come out more<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>For the sake of your family you ought to 
<lb/>be more of a popularity hunter - "Bosh" 
<lb/><add place="above">you say</add> "Teach your grand mother" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. We think 
<lb/>before hand how all your friends would 
<lb/>feel if any of the Nobodies should be 
<lb/>lifted over your head. Be as angry as 
<lb/>you like with me I repeat you ought 
<lb/>to make yourself more known. Could 
<lb/>you not do something in the popular 
<lb/>line with your Museum. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is nothing 
<lb/>mean in it - see how <persName>Playfair</persName> and 
<lb/><persName>Sir Roderick</persName> get on. It is all fair 
<lb/>and above board. </p>

<lb/>We have been sadly vexed by <persName>Rae</persName>
<lb/>and the boxes five of which were lately 
<lb/>seen at <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> without any 
<lb/>addresses. He was entrusted to address 
<lb/>them to your father when he should 
<lb/>get paint. Some boxes had "<persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>" 
<lb/>on the corner. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Burrup</persName> the 
<w>missi-<lb break="no"/>onary</w> who saw them added "<placeName>England</placeName>" 
<lb/>a wide direction enough. One box 
<lb/>with no address contained birds 
<lb/>and belongs to my brother. I have 
<lb/>been bothered enough by my 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>panions,</w> but did not expect <persName>Rae</persName>
<lb/>to act this way. If all had been 
<lb/>like <persName>Kirk</persName> I should have had smooth 
<lb/>sailing. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Meller</persName> is very industrious 
<lb/>but many of his specimens will 
<lb/>be duplicates of <persName>Kirk's</persName>. I feel 
<lb/>annoyed because many of the 
<lb/>plants from <placeName>Zomba</placeName> were the 
<lb/>same as <persName>Welwitsch</persName> got on the 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001704_0006"/><!--pb/@n='179e'--> 
<lb/>highlands of <placeName>Angola</placeName>. Ours were 
<lb/>collected long ago and but for <persName>Rae's</persName>
<lb/>conduct would have been registered 
<lb/>first<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Please present my kindest 
<lb/>regards to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Hooker</persName>, and to your 
<lb/>father. My wife is I believe now 
<lb/>on her way out here after a three 
<lb/>years unexpected separation. Has 
<lb/>your eldest boy taken to anything<reg>?</reg>
<lb/>My hopeful ran away from 
<lb/>his tutor lately. They were trying 
<lb/>to cram him <add place="above">with Latin &amp; Greek</add> if I understand 
<lb/>rightly, and thrashing was threatened 
<lb/>so off he went. Our friend <persName>Playfair</persName>
<lb/>helped at this juncture &amp; he is now 
<lb/>at a school at <placeName>St Andrews</placeName>. It is 
<lb/>comforting to think how much 
<lb/>better <hi rend="underline">we</hi> were when <hi rend="underline">we</hi> were 
<lb/>young!! <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
