<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kuruman</placeName> 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> June 1843</p>
<lb/><p>My very Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p>I shall not advert to the topics contained 
<lb/>in the other letter which I enclose to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><choice><sic>Maclehose</sic><corr>MacLehose</corr></choice></persName><choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut will 
<lb/>endeavour to give you some account of my recent tour 
<lb/>to the tribes of the Interior. You who are accustomed to 
<lb/>Railways &amp; steamboats can form no idea of the slowness of 
<lb/>our movements in this country, <choice><reg>w</reg><orig>W</orig></choice>e are five or six centuries 
<lb/>behind you in regard to locomotion, and this makes our 
<lb/>itineraries as tedious as voyages to India<choice><reg>.</reg><orig>,</orig></choice> I had 10 
<lb/>days of this tedious drawling before I reached the valley of 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term><!--tribe or place name?--> which you may associate in your 
<lb/>mind with the turning point of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName> when he 
<lb/>visited the <placeName>Kurrichane Mountains</placeName> for the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> tribe 
<lb/>live within half a day of the spot where his waggon stood 
<lb/>in its farthest progress north. It is also the spot where 
<lb/>he was informed of the existence of iron founderies. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>are still in existence but they do not refuse me permission 
<lb/>to examine them as they did to him, and it is also near 
<lb/>to the place where the notorious <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> had his residence 
<lb/>when seen by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>. I walked over the site of his 
<lb/>town &amp; the spot where his people suffered a dreadful 
<lb/>defeat <del type="strikethrough">by</del><unclear cert="medium">from</unclear> the boers, the rock where he executed those 
<lb/>who had fallen under his displeasure by casting them 
<lb/>down was unknown to the natives who now reside in 
<lb/>that vicinity. But though I examined with care the whole 
<lb/>locality and anything which might have remained could be 
<lb/>easily discovered as the grass had been but recently 
<lb/>burned off, I could only see a <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">very</add> few human bones 
<lb/>&amp; these the last vestiges of the tyrant will soon all 
<lb/>be devoured by the hungry Hyaena. I mention these 
<lb/>things because there is a probability I shall <reg>be</reg> located for 
<lb/>some time at least <del type="strikethrough">near</del><add place="below">^</add><add place="above">in</add> that neighbourhood<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>r</orig></choice>he chief <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegoe</unclear></persName> of the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="low">Wanketye</unclear></term> who suffered a 
<lb/>cruel massacre by the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> last year also lives in

<lb/><choice><sic>lives in</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> that neighbourhood and as some of the believers 
<lb/>of <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> were on a visit to him at the time of attack 
<lb/>&amp; in circumstances which could not fail to produce 
<lb/>an impression on the minds of the Heathen that they had been 
<lb/>the means of betraying the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="low">Wanketye</unclear></term>, one of the objects of my 
<lb/>journey was to endeavour by my presence &amp; explanations 
<lb/>to disabuse his <unclear cert="medium">&amp;</unclear> their minds of that impression. It was not 
<lb/>without danger that one put himself into his hands, for 
<lb/><persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegoe</unclear></persName> has been an almost total stranger to missionaries<reg>.</reg> But 
<lb/>the Lord was with me &amp; gave me favour in his eyes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I went directly to him as soon I arrived, the people 
<lb/>crowded around &amp; as <choice><sic>the</sic><corr>they</corr></choice> recognized a young man who was 
<lb/>with the others at the period of attack it was anything 
<lb/>but pleasant to see their looks &amp; gestures. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he first uproar 
<lb/>having ceased <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegoe</unclear></persName> demanded of me why I had attacked 
<lb/>&amp; destroyed all his people. I replied why did you not 
<lb/>listen to the advice I sent you last year from the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> country &amp; thus destroy yourself. I told you 
<lb/>if you came out of the <placeName>Bakalihari desert</placeName><persName>Mahura</persName>
<lb/>would certainly attack you. Did your messengers fail 
<lb/>to deliver my message or did you discredit it? <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>messengers were there to recognise me and by a few 
<lb/>Scotch answers of that sort his prejudice seemed 
<lb/>to evaporate &amp; he became quite friendly. In one of 
<lb/>the letters I wrote you I gave an account of <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegoe</unclear></persName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He is the bravest of all the <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> chiefs &amp; 
<lb/>passing into the <placeName>Bakalihari desert</placeName> bade defiance 
<lb/>to all the forces of <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>. He was on the 
<lb/>march out of it last year when he heard of my 
<lb/>presence in the <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> country &amp; sent a number 
<lb/>of messengers to me with the present of an ox. I 
<lb/>warned him not to come out of the desert as 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> (people of <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>) would certainly 
<lb/>attack &amp; plunder him of his cattle. He did not know 
<lb/>the power of guns &amp;c. which the unbelieving 
<lb/>portion of the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> now possess &amp; and ventured to 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000524_0003"/><!--pb/@n='100r'-->
<lb/>act contrary to my advice. Of the subsequent massacre of 
<lb/>his people I also informed you in another letter. I left him 
<lb/>now evincing towards me a most friendly disposition<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But perhaps the reason why I did not fare worse might 
<lb/>be what one of his people told me, "O, nobody thinks 
<lb/>of killing a teacher"<reg>.</reg> As poor <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegoe</unclear></persName> now is, his power 
<lb/>is gone, only the remains of his tribe are left him<reg>,</reg> yet 
<lb/>what he gave me in the way of presents he gave like a 
<lb/>king. When he sent milk or porridge to me they were 
<lb/>always in a dish as large as that basket sort of thing 
<lb/>you put your plates in at dinner. When I returned from 
<lb/>the countries beyond that he took me to the house of one 
<lb/>of his wives &amp; said, as we squatted down beside a huge 
<lb/>pot of beer, "now you must remain many days with 
<lb/>me &amp; we shall drink much together", "my wives (he has 
<lb/>five of them) are all busy making beer for you"<reg>.</reg> I am still a teetotaler notwithstanding <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moore's</persName>
<lb/>"defection"<reg>.</reg> But I always take a little of their stuff 
<lb/>when it is offered in kindness. It is not 
<w>intoxicat-<lb break="no"/>ing</w> whatever the quantity drunk may be, and is as 
<lb/>thick as the nice gruel you used to make but sour 
<lb/>bitter &amp; of a pink colour. I think it is nutritious 
<lb/>for it contains a large quantity of the native corn 
<lb/>from which it is made by a very simple 
<lb/>process. Another kind of beer is now being 
<w>introd-<lb break="no"/>uced</w> into this country made from honey &amp; a native 
<lb/>root which is not only intoxicating but produces 
<lb/>a kind of frenzy most horrible to behold. With 
<lb/>respect to this I am a teetotaler as I never tasted 
<lb/>it. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he other or <unclear cert="medium">ancient</unclear> beer I taste to shew good 
<lb/>will but fear in any way to encourage by example 
<lb/>the other pernicious drug. I never objected to beer 
<lb/>or porter as a medicinal agent but only never felt 
<lb/>I needed it as such. I went a long way beyond 
<lb/><persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegoe</unclear></persName> not less I think than 350 miles, North. Formerly 
<lb/>traders went far beyond missionaries. Now I am determined

<lb/>if spared to be outdone by no one in carrying the blessed gospel 
<lb/>to the regions beyond. I see it stated <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> intends to 
<lb/>go where no white man has yet been<reg>.</reg> I can tell you he 
<lb/>must go a precious long way for that purpose for I have 
<lb/>been as far on the other side of his farthest point North 
<lb/>as that is on the other side of <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>. I should have 
<lb/>visited a lake in the Interior which has been long known 
<lb/><anchor xml:id="envelopePosition" type="positionMarker"/>by report<reg>.</reg> But I had a most dastardly set of servants with 
<lb/>me this time who refused to go with me farther than the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> country. I had therefore to leave them &amp; the 
<w>wag-<lb break="no"/>gon</w> there &amp; proceed Northward on an ox. A curious enough 
<lb/>mode of conveyance for add to the great looseness of his 
<lb/>skin which renders it difficult to stick on, the annoyance 
<lb/>of him putting back his long horns (frequently 4 or 5 feet long) 
<lb/>to give one a punch in the belly when he likes<reg>.</reg></p><addSpan spanTo="#p99r-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fol. 99r'--></addSpan>
