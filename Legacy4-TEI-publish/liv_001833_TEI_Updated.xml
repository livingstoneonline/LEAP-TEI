<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Rovuma Bay</placeName> 16 Oct<hi rend="sup">r</hi></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1862</p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p><persName>My Lord</persName></p>
<lb/><p>In spite of all our efforts 
<lb/>we were baffled and delayed in the 
<lb/>lower part of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> till the river 
<lb/>fell and we had to go to <placeName>Johanna</placeName>
<lb/>for a new crew. It then occurred 
<lb/>to me to go up the river <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>in boats and see whether in the 
<lb/>event of the Portuguese continuing 
<lb/>to refuse free egress by the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>we have not another outlet from 
<lb/>the Lake region. We began our 
<lb/>ascent on the 9<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> September and 
<lb/>went up 114 miles as the crow 
<lb/>flies but 156 of actual distance 
<lb/>up the river. The water as we 
<lb/>expected was very low and we 
<lb/>had often to drag the boats over 
<lb/>shoals but in one month we 
<lb/>had accomplished all that it 
<lb/>was prudent to attempt.</p>
<lb/><p>We had to pass a number 
<lb/>of river pirates about sixty miles 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001833_0002"/><!--pb/@n='57v'-->
<lb/>from the mouth and tried hard to 
<lb/>keep on friendly terms with them but 
<lb/>after paying about 30 yards of calico 
<lb/>by way of cementing friendship 
<lb/>they parted with us by giving us 
<lb/>a volley of arrows and four 
<lb/>musket balls went through my 
<lb/>sail. I believe they expected us to 
<lb/>run away and leave all we had 
<lb/>to be plundered. They were living 
<lb/>on sandbanks afraid they said of 
<lb/>being stolen, and intent on stealing 
<lb/>others. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey partake of the border 
<lb/>character, and are found all round 
<lb/>Africa ever hindering ingress, and 
<lb/>I think slave-hunting makes them 
<lb/>bloodthirsty. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he attack on us was 
<lb/>perfectly causeless, and in one village 
<lb/>we saw two human heads cut off. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hrough them there was no trade 
<lb/>but above that part a great deal 
<lb/>is carried on by means of canoes, 
<lb/>and all the people even those 
<lb/>of the same tribe were quite friendly.</p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he river has an elevated table 
<lb/>land on each side for eighty miles, 
<lb/>it then opens on a wide plain with 
<lb/>here and there detached hills. 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001833_0003"/><!--pb/@n='58r'-->
<lb/>On this plain the slave trade route from 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName> to <placeName>Quiloa (Kilwa)</placeName> passes. It 
<lb/>touches the river twice &amp; indeed it 
<lb/>crosses the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> about thirty miles 
<lb/>beyond our turning point - and that 
<lb/>ford is only ten days from the Lake. 
<lb/>The bed of the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> gradually became 
<lb/>rocky, and at last was seen coming 
<lb/>by numerous channels through 
<lb/>masses of rock, though the adjacent 
<lb/>country was as far as we could see 
<lb/>still quite level. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he canoes go 
<lb/>through these channels and we might 
<lb/>have hauled the boats but they 
<lb/>would have been damaged in the 
<lb/><add place="below">^</add><add place="above">descent</add> and having come to the limits of 
<lb/>steam navigation we did not wish 
<lb/>to lose a moment of the flood time 
<lb/>in the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>The people generally cultivate largely 
<lb/>but all live in fear of being stolen<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>They keep large quantities of grain and 
<lb/>oil yielding seeds in the woods but live 
<lb/>on sandbanks now that the river is 
<lb/>low - and are much more afraid of 
<lb/>losing themselves than their goods. <choice><reg>O</reg><orig>o</orig></choice>ne cannot <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> the amount 
<lb/>which will be added to the sum of 
<lb/>human happiness by the success 
<lb/>of the English measures for abolishing 
<lb/>the slave trade. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his part possesses 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001833_0004"/><!--pb/@n='58v'-->
<lb/>great natural riches in oil producing seeds 
<lb/>gum copal, and valuable timber. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>ebony far exceeds in size &amp; value that of 
<lb/>commerce, and besides some valuable 
<lb/>woods for ship building we saw many 
<lb/>quite new to us. We saw but little 
<lb/>cotton but it was growing around old 
<lb/>villages. Indeed we saw but little of 
<lb/>the country. We have now seen the river 
<lb/>in flood and at its lowest. It has the 
<lb/>disadvantage of the Tsetse - but a steamer 
<lb/>drawing 18 inches of water when loaded 
<lb/>could ply during seven or eight months 
<lb/>of the year, and raise a lucrative trade, 
<lb/>there is no bar at the mouth, and 
<lb/>should English trade prosper on the 
<lb/>Lake this route will be adopted rather 
<lb/>than pay dues to the Portuguese who 
<lb/>never using the mouths of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>themselves have established a sort 
<lb/>of "paper blocade" over them. We sail 
<lb/>tomorrow back to the Zambesi. No one 
<lb/>has felt the delay more keenly than I have 
<lb/>done - and no effort on my part 
<lb/>will be spared that in my next I 
<lb/>may be able to report that we 
<lb/>have commenced work on the Lake.</p>
<lb/><p>Allow me to congratulate you on 
<lb/>the present very favourable aspect of the 
<lb/>slave trade question. It seems as if you were 
<lb/>to see your long continued labours crowned 
<lb/>with success. With kind salutation to <persName>Lady P.</persName></p>
