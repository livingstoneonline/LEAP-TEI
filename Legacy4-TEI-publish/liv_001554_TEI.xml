<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>After waiting 23 days at 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone Harbour</placeName> we left on the 14<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> currt for 
<lb/><placeName>Mazaro</placeName> in order to get <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> conveyed by this 
<lb/>route to Quilimane. The river being full now 
<lb/>we might have gone near <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> by one of 
<lb/>the canals off the <placeName>Luabo</placeName> - but our vessel has 
<lb/>35 patches held on by over 60 bolts in her bottom 
<lb/>and without wind we cannot make more than 
<lb/>1/4 knot an hour. She is without cargo too 
<lb/>and certainly have not a ton with crew and 
<lb/>everything else. Everything is in the Pinnace 
<lb/>yet you can<reg>'</reg>t see the waterline. It is very 
<lb/>doubtful indeed if she ever reaches <placeName>Tette</placeName> as she has 
<lb/>scores of minute holes all over which entail 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>stant</w> watching &amp; labour. We abandon her at 
<lb/><placeName>Tette</placeName> if she does not abandon us before that. 
<lb/>Never was Expedition crippled and belaboured 
<lb/>as we have been by trusting the Niger Philanthropist. </p>
<lb/><p>No ship having called I am hopelessly in the 
<lb/>dark as a new ship. One we shall have 
<lb/>either by public or private means. Our prospects 
<lb/>seem to me brighter than ever though I try to 
<lb/>divert the whole of any sanguine tinge. </p>

<lb/><p>I long to hear what you think of them from 
<lb/>a cool business point of view. One thing, 
<lb/>should the Bann or another vessel be given, we ought to have a pennon and a couple of respectable 
<lb/>guns, not for fighting but for respect. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>Portuguese look on us with great jealously 
<lb/>this is much increased of late by some English 
<lb/>forcing commerce up the river at <placeName>Delagoa Bay</placeName>
<lb/>and they think we mean to do the same here. 
<lb/>I have requested <persName>Lord John Russell</persName> to try and get 
<lb/>freedom of trade on this river or at least on 
<lb/>those parts never used by the Portuguese as the 
<lb/><placeName>Luabo</placeName> below <placeName>Mazaro</placeName> &amp; the <placeName>Shire</placeName>. If not this 
<lb/>then let us work it out quietly without 
<lb/>troubling the Portuguese, but for this we 
<lb/>would require to be able to say that we are 
<lb/>a man of war. They make much of my 
<lb/>being consul for <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> only. I say nothing 
<lb/>of course of my being accredited to other tribes 
<lb/>beyond their dominion. Nothing is said to me, 
<lb/>but as much as possible to my companions 
<lb/>by way of sounding them or drawing me into a 
<lb/>discussion. With a soil and climate far superior 
<lb/>to <placeName>Natal</placeName> they do nothing but peddle in ivory<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I think we ought to try the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> if we 
<lb/>cannot get free trade here. 1000 feet must be 
<lb/>accounted for along that river to the sea but 
<lb/>the fall may be in a shorter space than the 35 
<lb/>miles of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> and it is happily beyond

<lb/>Portuguese claims. </p>
<lb/><p>The river is now magnificent 
<lb/>just as <persName>Captain Gordon</persName> described 
<lb/>it "more like an inland sea 
<lb/>than a river". By the way the 
<lb/>chart of <persName>Baines</persName> above <placeName>Senna</placeName>
<lb/>is what is never seen. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>great expanse of water is what 
<lb/>always strikes the eye and he 
<lb/>acknowledged that his sketch 
<lb/>was not its actual appearance 
<lb/>but what ought to be in instead 
<lb/>of the sand banks in mere lines as 
<lb/>compared with the water. I did 
<lb/>not suggest alteration as I considered 
<lb/>it would be near the truth to give 
<lb/>it as bad as it ever can become 
<lb/>for its low water. For two years 
<lb/>past it has been fordable in two 
<lb/>places. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his never occurred according 
<lb/>to the Portuguese before. All my 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>panions</w> are well &amp; well tired of the 
<lb/>slow movement up<reg>.</reg><persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
