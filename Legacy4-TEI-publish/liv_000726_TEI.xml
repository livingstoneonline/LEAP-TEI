<lb/>and as we were putting our stuff into the waggons I could 
<lb/>not answer it. We are now on the route to the Lake &amp; 
<lb/>are engaged in drawing water out of the deep wells of 
<lb/><placeName>Boatlanama.</placeName><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he oxen making a dreadful lowing 
<lb/>because they have been two days without water, so 
<lb/>you need not expect fine writing. I expect some of them 
<lb/>will tumble themselves into the wells before morning 
<lb/>and force us to eat them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his will be taken back 
<lb/>by a Mokalahari and I hope you will hear by it 
<lb/>that I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> your favour written it seems in a hurry 
<lb/>as this is. We are going North again. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he country is 
<lb/>drying up. The <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> is losing its pools even and 
<lb/>the people must <unclear cert="medium">annobe</unclear> whether they will or not 
<lb/>there are many reasons why we should go to the 
<lb/>regions beyond but yet it is a venture. We venture 
<lb/>our all and who would not for such a Saviour 
<lb/>"Lo I am with you." Be it so our Lord. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hy presence 
<lb/>is enough. 
<lb/>We feel much when we look at 
<lb/>our children going into a fever country 
<lb/>But we all belong to the Great Redeemer and let him do what is good in his own sight 
<lb/>May we all be resigned in all circumstances to his 
<lb/>will. And active in our duty to him &amp; the souls of the sinful breathren<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>There is nothing interesting in this part of the world. All is dead 
<lb/>and stagnant the fields burned up. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he grass crumbles in

<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he reason why I write now is a selfish one 
<lb/>We wish to trouble you again. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Pyne's taste in choosing 
<lb/>dresses is so highly gauged in the interior of <placeName>Africa</placeName>
<lb/>we beg to put her to it again. We send a notice to 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Tidman</persName> that he is to pay M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Pyne Â£10 on demand 
<lb/>and this is to be laid out in clothing for my better half

<lb/>Regulate the amount by the money sent. And send in

<lb/>as we were last year. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat is if as successful as we hope 
<lb/>We shall probably go beyond Sebitoane seeking an elevated 
<lb/>locality. We shall of course write you on our 
<lb/>return, and give you the particulars. At present we 
<lb/>have nothing to speak about but our hopes &amp; 
<lb/>fears. Of these we have an assortment on hand 
<lb/>and you must pray for us that we may be made 
<lb/>faithful even unto death. Was <persName>Manning Prentice</persName>
<lb/>married? Sorry to hear of <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cecil's</persName> illness but 
<lb/>we can not condole with any one for we are all 
<lb/>so far away. If we condoled with a widower 
<lb/>he might be laughing with his new wife by 
<lb/>the time we reached him. If with a widow 
<lb/>she might be married to another and almost forgetting 
<lb/>that she had ever had another husband or if with 
<lb/>anyone else it might come upon them like ripping 
<lb/>up old sores. Matters go on as usual among us<reg>.</reg> Our children are our cue. Thankful to say all well 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey have a weary time of it in the waggon<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Kind love to all of yours. <persName>Mary &amp;c</persName> from 
<lb/>both of us. Excuse me troubling you so<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Ever Affectionately </p>
