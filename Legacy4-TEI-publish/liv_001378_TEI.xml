<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>A letter from <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Cook</persName>
<lb/>the master in charge of the Lynx 
<lb/>which I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>conveys such a different 
<lb/>idea of <placeName>Luabo</placeName> or principal 
<lb/>mouth of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName><add place="above">from ours</add> that 
<lb/>I think I would not be doing 
<lb/>my duty did I not place it in 
<lb/>your hands. The Lynx remained 
<lb/>a week we remained only 
<lb/>three days - this shews what 
<lb/>a survey might effect<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I went yesterday up a creek 
<lb/>branching off from the left 
<lb/>of this harbour &amp; running 
<lb/>parallel with the coast &amp; 
<lb/>found that it communicated 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001378_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>with the <placeName>Luabo</placeName> and today we 
<lb/>take the launch through it 
<lb/>in our way back to <placeName>Tette</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We have got several repairs made 
<lb/>in her - and I got a quartermaster 
<lb/><persName>John Walker</persName>- and a stoker 
<lb/><persName>W<hi rend="sup underline">m</hi> Roe</persName> for her the former 
<lb/>at double full pay £72 per 
<lb/>annum - the latter at £50<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The Ban is the vessel for the 
<lb/>work of if it will be given 
<lb/>and then a second master 
<lb/>as surveyor would be quite 
<lb/>high enough rank for her 
<lb/>commander. My experience 
<lb/>would lead me to prefer 
<lb/>
being without a naval com
<lb/>mander. <persName>Kirk</persName> &amp; <persName>Thornton</persName>
<lb/>are anxious to go to <placeName>Manica</placeName>
<lb/>by way of <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName> West of 
<lb/><placeName>Senna</placeName>. The only difficulty 
<lb/>I see in the way is I cannot 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001378_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>very well leave the Launch to 
<lb/>go with them. I am very 
<lb/>anxious to see the inscriptions 
<lb/>on <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName>. The river 
<lb/>in October attains its lowest 
<lb/>but the Ban would go up 
<lb/>to <placeName>Tette</placeName> easily even now 
<lb/>after we know which is 
<lb/>the best channel. This launch 
<lb/>is decidedly bad as far as the 
<lb/>engine is concerned a head 
<lb/>wind holds the paddles &amp; she can<reg>'</reg>t turn the centre<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I have drawn on the 
<lb/>funds of the expedition 
<lb/>again as I had to give 
<lb/>the Pearl £30 and some 
<lb/>stores, and paid advances 
<lb/>on Kroomen's wages 
<lb/>besides arrears of two 
<lb/>whom we leave in Lynx. </p>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001378_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/><p>We had not a drop of wine for 
<lb/>the quinine though we have used 
<lb/>our river stock for that alone 
<lb/>and as medicine - though I am 
<lb/>not out of money as I expect 
<lb/>a bill for <persName>Bedingfeld's</persName> keep at 
<lb/><placeName>Kilimane</placeName> and we have decided 
<lb/>not to come down at Christmas 
<lb/>on account of getting per Lynx 
<lb/>what we needed then I thought 
<lb/>it best to be beforehand - I expect 
<lb/>we shall need no more for 
<lb/>a twelvemonth. Thanks for your 
<lb/>two kind notes - We are at present 
<lb/>all well - this harbour is all exposed 
<lb/>to the see breeze and not like <persName>Skead's</persName>
<lb/>surrounded &amp; closed in by Mangrove 
<lb/>swamps. Next time I shall tell 
<lb/>you all about the <placeName>Kebrabasa</placeName> for 
<lb/>we go now to examine it at low 
<lb/>water. I am hoping we shall not 
<lb/>require to take the Launch to pieces 
<lb/>even there - I have got various supplies 
<lb/>slops &amp;c from the naval departments 
<lb/>all being very kind<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>I wrote a letter to <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> John Laird</persName> and gave him full particulars 
<lb/>about his engine but on second thoughts do not send it. On careful 
<lb/>examination. I think his conduct to us shameful. Numerous articles 
<lb/>commonly given gratis with engines are to us all charged.</p>

<lb/><p> The Lynx lost a boat's crew on the <placeName>Luabo</placeName> bar before 
<lb/>we came down having mistaken it for the <placeName>Kongone</placeName>. I suggested 
<lb/>to <persName>Captain Berkely</persName> to put up a beacon on the island on <placeName>Kongone</placeName>

<lb/>mouth and he has done it except supports which are indicated by dotted 
<lb/>lines. <figure><graphic style="float:left" url="LETT924-1.gif"/><figDesc/></figure> I have decided to ask the <persName>Governor</persName> of <placeName>Kilimane</placeName> to send 
<lb/>our letters to <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> rather than allow ship's boats 
<lb/>call at that dangerous port. We shall try also to get our 
<lb/>letters kept at a village near this. </p><anchor xml:id="p1r-01"/>
