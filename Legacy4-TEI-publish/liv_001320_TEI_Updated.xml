<lb/><p rend="right"><term type="boat">Screw Steamer Pearl</term></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">10<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> May 1858</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p>We are now in sight of 
<lb/>land near <placeName>Delgoa Bay</placeName> and have the 
<lb/>prospect <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">of being</add> off the <placeName>Luabo</placeName> by the 14<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> so 
<lb/>I begin to write a little now in order 
<lb/>not to be behind hand with my letters 
<lb/>when we dismiss the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> to pursue 
<lb/>her way to <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>. We have been remarkably 
<lb/>favoured in the weather ever since we 
<lb/>left Liverpool and made rather a 
<lb/>crack passage to <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hence 
<lb/>to the Cape was rather more tedious but 
<lb/>it was only 21 days. During the whole 
<lb/>of this part of our voyage <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">L</hi></hi></persName> had 
<lb/>continued sickness and it greatly reduced 
<lb/>her and compelled us to alter our plans<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The non appearance of <persName>Ma Robert</persName> will be 
<lb/>a great disappointment to the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Their enemies the <term type="tribe">Matebele</term> of <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>
<lb/>lately commenced to make canoes at 
<lb/>a part of the <choice><sic>of the</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> river below the falls 
<lb/>of Victoria and as the <placeName>Leeambye</placeName> or <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> all along both above and below 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001320_0002"/><!--pb/@n='45v'--> 
<lb/>that, is the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> line of defence they 
<lb/>endeavoured to put a stop to canoe making 
<lb/>on the southern bank but were repulsed 
<lb/>by the <term type="tribe">Matebele</term> with loss. There was 
<lb/>great mourning at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> in 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>sequence</w> and I fear I shall have to 
<lb/>lament the loss of some of my friends 
<lb/>there. This bit of information I got 
<lb/>from <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> and M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> Moffat</persName> of <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>
<lb/>who to our most agreeable surprise we 
<lb/>found had come down about 700 miles 
<lb/>partly to see us, but chiefly to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> and 
<lb/>assist those young missionaries who 
<lb/>were so liberally subscribed for and who 
<lb/>ought to have been ere this at their fields 
<lb/>of labour. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> went to <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>
<lb/>to prepare the way for them and everything 
<lb/>is in readiness. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut this is only what 
<lb/>I declared eighteen months ago in relation 
<lb/>to both <term type="tribe">Matebele</term> and <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>.</p>
<lb/><p>On his visit <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Moffat</persName> learned 
<lb/>that my late companions had not yet 
<lb/>returned to the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> country. Hence 
<lb/>we may infer that they are still waiting 
<lb/>my return at <placeName>Tete</placeName>. We may also conclude 
<lb/>that the Portuguese officials there have 
<lb/>kindly fulfilled the generous wishes of 
<lb/>their young and noble minded king 
<lb/>when he ordered them to be supported at the 
<lb/>public expense of the <placeName>Province of Mosambique</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001320_0003"/><!--pb/@n='46r'-->
<lb/><p>We hear also that the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>
<lb/>had concluded that I was dead. Their Diviners 
<lb/>had made me out to be defunct long before 
<lb/>my return from <placeName>Loanda</placeName>, but though all 
<lb/>joined in the hearty laugh against them 
<lb/>when we reappeared, they <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> credit 
<lb/>again. When one realizes the dreariness 
<lb/>and isolation in which they dwell with 
<lb/>respect to the rest of the world, he 
<lb/>can appreciate in some degree the value 
<lb/>of literature and thank Providence that 
<lb/>his lot has been cast in England. Just 
<lb/>fancy the "Times" with the latest news 
<lb/>from parts thousands of miles distant 
<lb/>on the daily breakfast table, in contrast 
<lb/>with diviners dice and vagaries which 
<lb/>might could would or should happen or 
<lb/>not - the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> at <placeName>Tete</placeName> a few 
<lb/>hundred miles from home in all 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>bability</w> have heard absolutely nothing 
<lb/>of their friends at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>. It is 
<lb/>no wonder that with our means of 
<lb/>communication &amp; locomotion 
<lb/>people who are accustomed to look 
<lb/>neither before nor behind them nor 
<lb/>even round about them, should sometimes 
<lb/>ask if the African intellect is capable 
<lb/>of development. There is a mighty 
<lb/>gulph between us at present, 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001320_0004"/><!--pb/@n='46v'--> 
<lb/>certainly, <choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut though we may not very 
<lb/>vividly realize the length of the process 
<lb/>which has ended in the elevation of 
<lb/>many. We see pretty large masses of 
<lb/>the still unchiseled rock among us. It 
<lb/>is not so very long since we burned 
<lb/>witches and even now some folks 
<lb/>pay "wise ones" for their divination just 
<lb/>as do the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> and some of the 
<lb/>cleverest among us believed in second 
<lb/>sight and do put faith in table 
<lb/>turning and clairvoyance. We don<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>however ask if their intellects are capable 
<lb/>of further development.</p>
<lb/><p>You know we visited <placeName>Sierra 
<lb/>Leone</placeName>. This has not turned out all that 
<lb/>its founders anticipated. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut with all 
<lb/>its failings I believe it will in the 
<lb/>eyes of posterity <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">be considered</add> a noble monument 
<lb/>of the English philanthropic spirit<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Philanthropists have been greatly at 
<lb/>fault in several of their schemes. 
<lb/>In this case the site of the settlement 
<lb/>was and <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">is</add> to all appearance unexceptionable 
<lb/>but <placeName>Krootown</placeName> was worse than 
<lb/>a swamp and the settlement became 
<lb/>the grave of Europeans from its 
<lb/>contiguity. It was clearly a duty to 
<lb/>see to the proper drainage of
