<lb/><p>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> your 
<lb/>welcome letters by the boat in 
<lb/>the beginning of August instead 
<lb/>of as you thought the middle<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <del type="strikethrough">boat</del> <add place="above">canoe</add> with rum &amp; sugar 
<lb/>had still to come. You did all 
<lb/>that a man could do in the 
<lb/>circumstances, and I thank 
<lb/>you for your services - 
<lb/>suspecting that the silly 
<lb/><persName>Cape Governor</persName> had not 
<lb/>sent the money which his 
<lb/>predecessor <persName>Sir George Grey</persName>
<lb/>was always glad to do &amp; 
<lb/>indeed pressed me to make 
<lb/>use of him in that and every 
<lb/>other way, I could think of. 
<lb/>I gave <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Meller</persName> a bill for 
<lb/>Â£150 to <persName>Colonel Nunes</persName> instead 
<lb/>but you will be off by the 
<lb/>time of his arrival and 
<lb/>I fear I may not go to

<lb/><placeName>Quillimane</placeName> at all - You were 
<lb/>quite right to get off by the 
<lb/>earliest safe opportunity - 
<lb/>that dying by inches - 
<lb/>slow &amp; sure poison which 
<lb/>I saw in the crew of a Hamburgh 
<lb/>vessel was just what you 
<lb/>describe in Saunders - Be 
<lb/>sure &amp; write when you get 
<lb/>this &amp; let me know how 
<lb/>you are yourself - I feel 
<lb/>naturally very anxious 
<lb/>about you &amp; the rest - sorry 
<lb/>for poor <persName>Pearce</persName> - I shall 
<lb/>send off his packet as soon 
<lb/>as I can - We are thanks 
<lb/>to the Highest all well except 
<lb/><persName>King</persName> who complains of 
<lb/>pains in his limbs but works<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I have written a formal 
<lb/>complaint against being 
<lb/>subjected to the humiliation 
<lb/>of having our Despatch 
<lb/>subjected to missionary 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001957_0003"/><!--pb/@n='03'-->
<lb/>and other gossip at the <placeName>Cape</placeName>
<lb/>before we knew its contents<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I suspect the Governor 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Cape</placeName> as the guilty 
<lb/>person and after telling 
<lb/>how <persName>Adams</persName> came up 
<lb/>and hailed the ship with 
<lb/>"no more pay for you 
<lb/>Pioneer chaps. I bring the 
<lb/>letter as says it" and that 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Steere</persName> had expatiated 
<lb/>on the different paragraphs 
<lb/>before English &amp; Portuguese 
<lb/><add place="marginleft">at <placeName>Quillimaine</placeName></add> until you had felt 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>pelled</w> to the remark - "that 
<lb/>it was not likely he 
<lb/>could know the contents &amp;c 
<lb/>I add that notwithstanding 
<lb/>the courteousness of its 
<lb/>style my companions 
<lb/>&amp; self had been subjected 
<lb/>to very unmerited 
<w>humilia-<lb break="no"/>tion</w> - the Despatch was 
<lb/>sent open to the <persName>Cape Governor</persName>
<lb/>and I suspect that he 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001957_0004"/><!--pb/@n='04'-->
<lb/>to gain a little popularity with 
<lb/>high church folks had sent 
<lb/>it to the bishop - I shall not 
<lb/>call on the <persName>Governor</persName> though 
<lb/>I go to the <placeName>Cape</placeName> and will take 
<lb/>further public notice of the 
<lb/>indignity if no apology is 
<lb/>given. I don<reg>'</reg>t say a word 
<lb/>to the bishop about it but 
<lb/>will mention <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Steere's</persName> bad 
<lb/>manners - <persName>Earl Russell</persName> says 
<lb/>he will be glad to learn 
<lb/>that any of the gentlemen 
<lb/>of the Mission have profited 
<lb/>by my <add place="above">suggestions &amp;</add> experience" &amp;c &amp;c. 
<lb/>as they know this I shall 
<lb/>use it as a text<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>We liked the bishop well 
<lb/>enough during his half day's 
<lb/>stay with - he is the picture of <persName>Dillon of the Gorgon</persName> but 
<lb/>marked with small pox - 
<lb/><gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="manuscript"/> cautious &amp; no courage <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="manuscript"/> seems not too old to 
<lb/><gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="manuscript"/>. He might as well

<lb/>as it was he let me see that he 
<lb/>was mainly anxious to get in 
<lb/>to coincide in his own views 
<lb/>and he did not conceal his 
<lb/>intention to bolt. He gave a 
<lb/>hint about <unclear cert="low">pickings</unclear>out of 
<lb/>Pioneer but I shall take care 
<lb/>that they be of the smallest 
<lb/>and as for Lady Nyassa 
<lb/>I would rather see her 
<lb/>forming a second bar at 
<lb/><placeName>Quillimane</placeName> than that she 
<lb/>should be a slaver or <del type="strikethrough">a</del>
<lb/>Portuguese property which 
<lb/>would be the equivilent<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We mean to take her to 
<lb/><placeName>India</placeName> when the hurricane 
<lb/>season is over - wish we 
<lb/>could get into the Webbe 
<lb/>to wait for that. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>Washington</persName> pointedly said 
<lb/>"On no account take any 
<lb/>money from private 
<lb/>persons for her" and he 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001957_0006"/><!--pb/@n='06'-->
<lb/>sanctioned several things 
<lb/>additional which come to 
<lb/>a good sum yet not a 
<lb/>word is said about her<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I am not going to whine 
<lb/>about it however - </p>
<lb/><p>In reference to the remark 
<lb/>in the Despatch that the 
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi> as yet possessed 
<lb/>but scanty information 
<lb/>about the resources of 
<lb/>the country. I mention 
<lb/>the ample materials you 
<lb/>have sent or taken to 
<lb/>the Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi> Museum at 
<lb/><placeName>Kew</placeName> and that there is 
<lb/>no instance on record 
<lb/>of valuable information 
<lb/>being arranged without 
<lb/>consulting Herbaria and 
<lb/>authorities - &amp;  refer to 
<lb/><persName><!--the Sir has been added by a text version-->Sir William Hooker</persName>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001957_0007"/><!--pb/@n='07'-->
<lb/>as to whether the materials 
<lb/>are not as ample for 
<lb/>the illustration of the 
<lb/>natural productions of 
<lb/>the country as ever came 
<lb/>out of a barbarous 
<lb/>country &amp; from a 
<lb/>vessel in which nothing 
<lb/>without incessant 
<lb/>trouble could be preserved 
<lb/>I write to <persName>Sir William</persName>
<lb/>at same time. I suspect 
<lb/>some underling has 
<lb/>suggested the remark<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>Sir Roderick</persName> seems 
<lb/>no longer our friend 
<lb/>&amp; he has a say in everything<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I only conjecture <persName>Sir 
<lb/>Roderick's</persName> coldness 
<lb/>from his ceasing to 
<lb/>write<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><persName>Rae</persName> gets on very fast in 
<lb/>rebuilding Lady Nyassa 
<lb/>his heart is in it. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>worthy <persName>Laird of Limefield</persName>
<lb/><choice><sic>say</sic><corr>says</corr></choice> that we must be <unclear cert="low">awful</unclear>
<lb/>"clashers" out here. We surely 
<lb/>must as the "clashers" got so 
<lb/>far before reaching us on 
<lb/>the spot. About a month 
<lb/>ago we were talking just as we 
<lb/>used to do about the <persName>Governor 
<lb/>of Quillimame</persName> making so 
<lb/>much of medical services 
<lb/>to the army &amp; auxiliary forces 
<lb/>without ever thanking me 
<lb/>for carrying him out of the 
<lb/>thick of it. When it suddenly 
<lb/>struck me that this might 
<lb/>with additions be converted 
<lb/>into a "clash" I never 
<lb/>contemplated - if it does so 
<lb/>become, you will know 
<lb/>what to think of it<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>

	<pb n="0009" facs="liv_001957_0009"/><!--pb/@n='09'-->
<lb/><persName>Meller</persName> left us on 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 
<lb/>He is spoken of as consul 
<lb/>for <placeName>Madagascar</placeName> and had 
<lb/>applied for it. I don<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>know if anyone is 
<lb/>appointed to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>
<lb/>but it might be well for 
<lb/>you to apply. In a few 
<lb/>years you could retire 
<lb/>with a competency &amp; 
<lb/>have done good service 
<lb/>in the mean time<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><persName>Waller</persName> wished to retire 
<lb/>rather than go to <placeName>Marambala</placeName>
<lb/>but the bishop gave in 
<lb/>to taking the freed woman 
<lb/>&amp; children &amp; he will go. It 
<lb/>would have been such a 
<lb/>mule to sit on a mountain 
<lb/>without people to teach

<lb/>who will soon die &amp; give 
<lb/>an excuse for bolting<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have told <persName>Earl Russell</persName> that the use made of 
<lb/>my previous advice 
<lb/>not to fight or engage 
<lb/>in native quarrels which 
<lb/><persName>bishop Mackenzie</persName> honestly 
<lb/>mentions in his journal 
<lb/>was to place all the blame 
<lb/>of their subsequent fighting 
<lb/>on my shoulders - the 
<lb/>mountain Marambala to 
<lb/>which they now go 
<lb/>will subject them by 
<lb/>its frequent clouds to 
<lb/>chills &amp; damps which 

	<pb n="0011" facs="liv_001957_0011"/><!--pb/@n='11'-->
<lb/>may be as prejudicial as
