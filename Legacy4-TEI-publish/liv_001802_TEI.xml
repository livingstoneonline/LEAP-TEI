<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>East Luabo</placeName> 22 July 1862 </p>
<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I have given a set of bills to <persName>S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>José Mellitaô Nunes </persName>of <placeName>Quillimane</placeName> for 
<lb/>£42.10. dated 29<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> May. Book 812. bill 2. 
<lb/>and another set for £51.10 dated 15<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> July 
<lb/>book 812. bill n<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi> 3. (both at Par.) to 
<lb/><persName>Senhor Manoel de Lima Vianna</persName>. </p>
<lb/><p>The amount given to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Nunes</persName> was 
<lb/>for 2 bales of calico and 40 bags of rice. 
<lb/>To Vianna for 1 bale of calico - 15 sheep, 
<lb/>some bags of rice - canoe and native hire 
<lb/>to bring wood and coals in our attempts 
<lb/>to carry up Lady Nyassa's sections and 
<lb/>to bring away our goods from <placeName>Tette</placeName>. 
<lb/>Also £10 for two small casks of wine 
<lb/>at £5 each. I still owe him a little for fresh 
<lb/>meat &amp;c. Our detention so long down here 
<lb/>has been most expensive though I have 
<lb/>exercised the utmost economy. You 
<lb/>may understand the difference of expense 
<lb/>here and up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>. Here we have to pay £1 for a sheep there we get one for 
<lb/>2 shillings worth of calico. Having much 
<lb/>sickness we had to hire natives and 
<lb/>paying them at the rate of 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> per day in 
<lb/>calico a great deal of that has been 
<lb/>spent. <persName>Rae</persName> had dysentery and I had to 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001802_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/><choice><sic>to</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> take him down to the <placeName>Kongone</placeName> to breathe 
<lb/>sea air. When we went on purpose to meet a 
<lb/>ship with a new Johanna crew &amp; provisions 
<lb/>something had occurred to prevent <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Oldfield</persName> from fulfilling his promise of sending 
<lb/>one at the appointed time. So we went up about 12<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> June. Launched the Lady Nyassa 
<lb/>broadside on, and put everything into her - 
<lb/>the ways were palm trees - and we were 
<lb/>ready to go up the river but no Johanna 
<lb/>men arriving and no provisions, we 
<lb/>must go in search of them to Johanna. 
<lb/>In coming down we ran aground three 
<lb/>times though we had a boat sounding 
<w>a-<lb break="no"/>head.</w> This leads me to think that we 
<lb/>had better go to the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> &amp; spend 
<lb/>the two months which must intervene 
<lb/>before the river rises in November in 
<lb/>boat exploration of that river in preference 
<lb/>to threading our way up the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>&amp; <placeName>Shire</placeName> at low water - but I shall let 
<lb/>you know definitely from Johanna. </p>
<lb/><p>I was very unwilling to believe that 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hardisty</persName> had so shamelessly neglected 
<lb/>his duty as I now see he has done. The 
<lb/>paddle shaft brasses gave way at <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>from sheer neglect, and caused the engine 
<lb/>to shake so that the nails came out of the 
<lb/>copper sheeting below. <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Rae</persName> put glands 
<lb/>on and secured them and us from a 
<lb/>general smash. <persName>Hardisty</persName> said to him 
<lb/>that he <add place="above"><persName>Rae</persName></add> would by touching them let himself 
<lb/>in for a month's work. <persName>Rae</persName> finished 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001802_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>them in 2 1/2 days and is going to make new 
<lb/>ones of Lignum vitae which is coming into 
<lb/>fashion now. The Rudder was cracked &amp; <persName>Rae</persName>
<lb/>proposed putting bands on it. <persName>Hardisty</persName> went 
<lb/>about saying in his nasty way to the men 
<lb/>that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> might as well pump ship on 
<lb/>it as try to mend it. He made it stronger 
<lb/>than ever in exactly two days. The boss of 
<lb/>the paddle wheel was broken in going up 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName> by striking against the bank. We were 
<lb/>at Chibisa's from the beginning of July to 
<lb/>the 15<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> November. <persName>Hardisty</persName> excused himself 
<lb/>by say our forge would not heat the plate 
<lb/>sufficiently to bend it for a patch. I got 
<lb/>another forge, and a smith from the Gorgon 
<lb/>bent the plate, but still it was unmended. 
<lb/>I asked <persName>Hardisty</persName> how long he would require 
<lb/>to put on the plate. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hree weeks, but he also 
<lb/>said publicly that he was not to be expected 
<lb/>to mend anything that broke. He had 
<lb/>done more in that way than he ever 
<lb/>intended - "An engineer is not expected to 
<lb/>work as a tradesman" &amp;c. <persName>Rae</persName> mended 
<lb/>the whole thing now become much worse 
<lb/>by neglect in two days. When just about 
<lb/>finishing this job though <persName>Hardisty</persName> had 
<lb/>been going about trying by talk to 
<lb/>make <persName>Rae</persName> give it up in disgust he came 
<lb/>to me and said that he felt well enough 
<lb/>to work; I replied, "I shall not require 
<lb/>your services anymore" and he 
<lb/>replied "Thank you". <persName>Rae</persName> has behaved 
<lb/>nobly all through. He said to me, <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Washington</persName> asked me if I were willing 
<lb/>to do anything in my power to help 
<lb/>the expedition, and I replied yes, and 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001802_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>I always have been so but I don<reg>'</reg>t like to hear 
<lb/><persName>Hardisty</persName> talking in the way he is doing to the 
<lb/>men. To put a stop to it I relieved him from 
<lb/>all charge in the way I mention about the 
<lb/>beginning of this month. I hear that he 
<lb/>has made a drawing of the way he tied up 
<lb/>the wheel in order to utter the monstrous 
<lb/>falsehood that he was prevented by me 
<lb/>from mending it. I shall give you the 
<lb/>evidence of the stokers to the contrary without 
<lb/>letting him know. The only thing I 
<lb/>prevented him meddling with was the 
<lb/><choice><sic>condensor</sic><corr>condenser</corr></choice>, as he wished to send it down 
<lb/>to the Cape to be brazed. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae </persName> &amp; <persName>Macleod</persName>
<lb/>fitted &amp; brazed all the pipes requiring to be 
<lb/>fitted, and it is to be put in today. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>air pump will require to be rebored 
<lb/>as <persName>Hardisty</persName> left the sand when once in 
<lb/>to "wash out again"! If <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Penn</persName>
<lb/>recommended this man he has little 
<lb/>regard for his really splendid engines. 
<lb/>The leading stoker <persName>King</persName> is a far better 
<lb/>engineer than <persName>Hardisty.</persName> He allowed 
<lb/>everything to go wrong when a very 
<lb/>little care would have kept all right. </p>
<lb/><p>A young man called <persName>Campbell</persName> with 
<lb/><persName>Tod</persName> &amp; <persName>Macgregor</persName> is said by <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Rae</persName> to 
<lb/>be a good hand. I knew him in my younger 
<lb/>days. At present we shall do well with 
<lb/><persName>King</persName> and you might increase his salary 
<lb/>if you think it right. <persName>Rae</persName> takes the 
<lb/>superintendance. <persName>Reid</persName> and <persName>Macleod</persName> are 
<lb/>excellent and willing workmen. </p>
<lb/><p>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001802_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
When we came down in May <persName>Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>was at death's door and had that baffling 
<lb/>symptom continued vomiting which 
<lb/>in the case of my poor wife rendered 
<lb/>our remedies unavailing. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> &amp; 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> C Livingstone</persName> had been sent to <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>for our luggage, and I had medical 
<lb/>charge. <persName>Meller</persName> being at the Cape on sick 
<lb/>leave. A blister put on the stomach 
<lb/>to relieve vomiting filled with serum 
<lb/>as dark as bile and he became deeply 
<lb/>jaundiced - 20 grains of calomel as 
<lb/>a last effort brought away immense 
<lb/>quantities of bile and saved him 
<lb/>with however severe salivation 
<lb/>from cold afterwards. I mention 
<lb/>this purely medical subject to you 
<lb/>as I expect to be blamed for as in 
<lb/>my heart I believe the saving of his 
<lb/>life. </p>
<lb/><p>We cut wood at the <placeName>Luabo</placeName> at that 
<lb/>time and went out over this bar, 
<lb/>it being quite smooth, <add place="above">2 1/2 fathoms</add> and came in 
<lb/>by the <placeName>Kongone</placeName>. When on the sea she 
<lb/>steamed with ease eight knots, and 
<lb/><persName>Rae</persName> says were her engines lifted a foot 
<lb/>or a foot and  a half she would give a 
<lb/>much higher rate than she did on the 
<lb/>trial trip - </p>
<lb/><p>If we could get a dozen draught oxen 
<lb/>from the Cape we would transport 
<lb/>the steamer at about 20 miles per day 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001802_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/>They cost about £10 each. The two mules 
<lb/>died at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> and I propose to use 
<lb/>other two which were brought for the mission. <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> we find new 
<lb/>from the Portuguese is particularly unhealthy 
<lb/>they might have told us sooner. They 
<lb/>say not even pigs can live there. There 
<lb/>are no tsetse and none at the cataracts 
<lb/>either. We never had so much sickness 
<lb/>before. We cured the fever quickly but 
<lb/>it returned again &amp; again to the same 
<lb/>patient. It was like treating patients 
<lb/>in ill drained or overcrowded dwellings 
<lb/>and we could not get away from the lowlands. We have good health at 
<lb/>present and it is now winter, and as 
<lb/>the Johanna men scarcely ever suffer 
<lb/>we shall trust more to them than to 
<lb/>Europeans. </p>
<lb/><p>A <persName>Lieutenant Burlton</persName> about whom 
<lb/>I wrote to you in April last, stating 
<lb/>that I did not require his services, 
<lb/>did not wait for my answer to 
<lb/>himself to the same effect, but came 
<lb/>up to <placeName>Quillimane</placeName> by the Pantaloon<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He brought no letter from the Admiral, 
<lb/>and nothing from you though he had 
<lb/>applied to you a long time ago. I still 
<lb/>think that in the river we do not 
<lb/>require a naval officer, and have 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001802_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/>told him so but give him a passage to 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna</placeName>. Even with <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Young</persName> the 
<lb/>gunner we get less work out of the 
<lb/>men than when we had no naval officer 
<lb/>aboard. He however does about three times 
<lb/>more than <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Gedye</persName> did. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Thornton</persName> has joined us again 
<lb/>after having been to <placeName>Kilimanjaro</placeName>
<lb/>with the <persName>Baron von Decken</persName>. He has 
<lb/>a boat of his own, and goes to 
<lb/>examine some rocks at <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName>
<lb/>having inscriptions on them. He will 
<lb/>go on with us on the Lake &amp; geologize there<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cooley</persName> is about as far out in 
<lb/>his structures of <persName>Rebman</persName> as he 
<lb/>was about the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> above the 
<lb/><placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName>. <persName>Thornton</persName> thinks that 
<lb/><persName>Rebman</persName> was correct. </p>
<lb/><p>The missionaries have retired 
<lb/>down to <placeName>Chibisa's</placeName> - but will soon 
<lb/>move up again as the lowlands 
<lb/>will never do for them. No <del type="strikethrough">sanitory</del>
<lb/>sanitary regulations were made at 
<lb/>their first residence and deposits 
<lb/>from 200 people make the place 
<lb/>a very "pest hole" The bishop and <persName>Burrup</persName>
<lb/>were ill before they started and braved 
<lb/>the wet and damp of the shire marshes 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001802_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'-->
<lb/>with the sad result you already know. 
<lb/>We could not in consequence of our 
<lb/>engineer<reg>'</reg>s culpable negligence get away 
<lb/>to the Highlands. The Portuguese acting on 
<lb/>our suggestions send their troops at 
<lb/>once up to <placeName>Tette</placeName> and save nearly all 
<lb/>while formerly by keeping them at 
<lb/><placeName>Quillimane</placeName> and <placeName>Senna</placeName> they lost 
<lb/>nearly the whole. </p>
<lb/><p>We have to pay and part with <persName>Waldman</persName>
<lb/>a German carpenter who is the laziest 
<lb/>mortal I ever met with - and the 
<lb/>pay of the present Johanna crew 
<lb/>is due - Our 7 inch hawser and 
<lb/>one of the 5 inches came out half 
<lb/>rotten from being stowed under the 
<lb/>provisions - the 7 inch parted when 
<lb/>towing the brig in and we took one 
<lb/>from the brig which will be in 
<lb/>the accounts of the Gorgon, as 
<lb/>also some biscuit. The brasses, 
<lb/>Kingstons &amp;c. sent have never 
<lb/>come - but may with the ale be at 
<lb/>the Cape. I regret the delay to which we 
<lb/>have been compelled. It has been sore 
<lb/>against the grain &amp; utterly beyond my 
<lb/>control. Many &amp; hearty thanks for all 
<lb/>your kind and prompt attention to our 
<lb/>wants<reg>.</reg> Yours affectionately <persName>D. Livingstone</persName></p>
