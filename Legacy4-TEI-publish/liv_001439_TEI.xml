<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Peters</persName> of <placeName>Berlin</placeName> has I believe worked up the zoology of this region. We caught

<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Smith</persName></p>
<lb/><p>A point which we 
<lb/>once had under discussion in your house 
<lb/>came so forcibly back to my mind a 
<lb/>short time ago that I felt bound to write 
<lb/>to you by the earliest opportunity and let 
<lb/>you know that I fear I misled you 
<lb/>in saying that the <term type="tribe">Balonda</term> have square 
<lb/>huts. of their own innate notion. We 
<lb/>have just been into a country almost 
<lb/>identical with <placeName>Louda.</placeName> It is high - has the 
<lb/>very same vegetation and abounds in 
<lb/>flowing streams rising in bogs. and there 
<lb/>I saw reason to doubt squares among 
<lb/>pure <term type="tribe">aborigines.</term> We went up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>about one hundred miles in this steamer 
<lb/>in a first trip. In a second we passed 
<lb/>our former point - a <unclear cert="low">rapid</unclear> or cataract - 
<lb/>on foot. and proceeding northwards 
<lb/>in a mountainous region for some forty 
<lb/>miles discovered a magnificient Lake 
<lb/>called <placeName>Shirwa.</placeName> It is about 20 or 30 
<lb/>miles broad and fifty or sixty long - 
<lb/>and seperated according to native 
<lb/>report from a much larger lake called 
<lb/><placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName> = the stars, by a strip of land only </p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><choice><sic>only</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> five or six miles broad. <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> itself 
<lb/>is distant from a branch of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> called 
<lb/><placeName>Rus</placeName> only 30 miles so we have a prospect 
<lb/>of opening up all <placeName>Eastern Africa</placeName> with land 
<lb/>carriage of not more than fifty miles. We 
<lb/>could hear nothing of <persName>Burton's</persName> party but <placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName>
<lb/>is the <placeName>Nyanja</placeName> or <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> which is believed 
<lb/>to reach well up to the Equator. Well so much 
<lb/>by way of preface. When up there and travelling 
<lb/>on foot we always slept outside the huts except 
<lb/>twice. and remembering your idea of round huts 
<lb/>I found you were perfectly right. Only when 
<lb/>we came to any village where native traders 
<lb/>had been did we see an attempt at the square 
<lb/>walls yet round roof. Where no traders had 
<lb/>been all were round both walls and roof 
<lb/>this must have been the case in <placeName>Louda</placeName> though 
<lb/>then I did not have the cause. The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>make nothing square except pitfalls - <figure><!--<graphic style="display:inline vertical-align:middle" url="lp107-1.gif"/>--><figDesc/></figure> I 
<lb/>imagine in imitation of the four feet of the 
<lb/>animal. the <term type="tribe">Barouse</term> make their huts of 
<lb/>a half moon shape <figure><!--<graphic style="display:inline vertical-align:middle" url="lp107-1.gif"/><figDesc/>--></figure> but when travelling 
<lb/>make sheds which I think may glide into 
<lb/>squares - Stakes are planted in a slanting direction 
<lb/>and bushes stuck in opposite them so as to form 
<lb/><figure><!--<graphic style="float:left" url="lp107-1.gif"/>--><figDesc/></figure> oblong sheds. In the <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> country where 
<lb/>we were this sort of shed was built on 
<lb/>a platform and an end or two ends put 
<lb/>in making a rude approximation to a square 
<lb/>some of the <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> had lean-tos to their huts 
<lb/>these were square or approaching to it. Otherwise 
<lb/>I think you are quite right in setting down 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001439_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>all untutored tribes as building round huts. The 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Manganya</term> make a frame for the outer walls. 
<lb/><figure><!--<graphic style="float:left" url="lp107-1.gif"/>--><figDesc/></figure> then make the roof in <unclear cert="low">it</unclear> as one puts a 
<lb/>filtering paper into a funnel. It is made ready there 
<lb/>and then turned over on to the walls. Excuse the 
<lb/>scrawls and believe that I felt sorry when by 
<lb/>longer observation I found that I had misled you 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Balanda</term> whom I saw with square walls. 
<lb/>probably imitated native slave traders huts. They 
<lb/>had however straight walls with sharp well 
<lb/>made angular corners for their sheets. </p>
<lb/><p>We have had <term type="ailment">fever</term> but of so mild a 
<lb/>form that <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> and I failed to recognise 
<lb/>it for many months. It was quite unlike 
<lb/>what I suffered so much from when destitute 
<lb/>of every comfort; and resembled closely 
<lb/><term type="ailment">"common colds."</term> their frequent recurrence 
<lb/>in the same individual with the same symptoms 
<lb/>at last led us to believe it was <term type="ailment">fever.</term> One 
<lb/>had <term type="ailment">sore bones.</term> all over sore &amp;c. another got 
<lb/><term type="ailment">heady</term> having had <term type="ailment">brain fever</term> as they call it 
<lb/>once at the <placeName>Cape.</placeName> Another looked as if he had 
<lb/>a <term type="ailment">bilious attack</term> and another as if he had a 
<lb/>fit of <term type="ailment">indigestion.</term> We begin to suspect that 
<lb/><term type="ailment">colds</term> everywhere may be the effect of <term type="ailment">malaria</term>
<lb/>We cure it quickly by what I discovered when 
<lb/>alone, a pill of <term type="curative">Resin of jalap,</term><term type="curative">calomel,</term> and 
<lb/><term type="curative">quinine:</term> as soon as the bowels move, relief is 
<lb/>obtained. We then give <term type="curative">quinine</term> to complete the 
<lb/>cure. This <term type="curative">quinine</term> is no prophylactic that 
<lb/>we can see. I never found it prevent a single 
<lb/>attack in my own person nor in others. We 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001439_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>are well because well provided for, and we 
<lb/>take the <term type="curative">quinine</term> partly for the <unclear cert="low">dram,</unclear> and partly 
<lb/>to prevent you folks blaming us after we are 
<lb/>dead! As for the Portuguese - they ought to die of 
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever.</term> They all have <term type="ailment">syphillis</term> either congenital or 
<lb/>acquired from the priest to the pagan - a dirty crew 
<lb/>"<unclear cert="low">sames</unclear>" - a species of <term type="ailment">itch</term> is about universal &amp; 
<lb/>nobody is ashamed of it. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> and I have 
<lb/>been more exposed to <term type="ailment">malaria</term> than the others 
<lb/>yet we have escaped. The <term type="tribe">Kroomnen</term> take it 
<lb/>and call it the same as they get at <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName></p>
<lb/><p> The <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> region is high we rose 
<lb/>1500 feet above the ship in ten days short 
<lb/>marches. <placeName>Mount Bzomba or Zomba</placeName> is over 
<lb/>6000 feet high. yet people live on its top 
<lb/>which may be fifteen miles broad. <placeName>Shirwa</placeName>
<lb/>water is bitter like but possibly not the 
<lb/>same as a weak solution of <term type="curative">epsom salts</term>
<lb/>Has plenty of leeches, fish &amp; alligators. I shall be 
<lb/>able to give you some photographs of the 
<lb/>people for your work on ethnology if you 
<lb/>are not in a great hurry with it. My 
<lb/>brother takes them. The peculiarity of this 
<lb/>region is expansion of the <unclear cert="low">alae nasi</unclear> and the 
<lb/>head prolonged upwards &amp; backward. No other 
<lb/>peculiarity. Good legs like Europeans often 
<lb/>seen our artist, <persName>Bowes,</persName> fails miserably with 
<lb/>natives. He makes a mixture of west coast African 
<lb/>South Australian with a dash of Patagonian 
<lb/>in a colour indiscribable.</p>
<lb/><p> My very kindest 
<lb/>salutations to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Smith.</persName><persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
