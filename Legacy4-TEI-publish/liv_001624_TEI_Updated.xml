The term did not usually refer to a specific disease but to a general disorder which might have any number of variants, for instance, malarial or intermittent, remittent, or continual.

A note from Dr. Livingstone to Dr. M\'William\', &lt;i&gt;Transactions of the Epidemiological Society of London&lt;/i&gt; 1859-62, 1: 235). This was the "remedy" Livingstone used thereafter for fever. Hindsight suggests the remedy worked in those cases that were suffering from malaria. Quinine, which had recently been isolated from Peruvian Bark or cinchona, is effective against the malarial parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. </note></term>

<lb/><p>The event of most
