<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> 19<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> April 1851 </p>
<lb/><p>My Very Dear Friend </p>
<lb/><p>I am happy to inform you that your 
<lb/>favour N<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi> 23 lately reached its destination and the reviews 
<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c. accompanying it were all right. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he parcel was 
<lb/>enclosed in a box containing clothing for the natives, but 
<lb/>by whom sent we have no means of knowing. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he letter 
<lb/>containing the list and name of the donor had probably 
<lb/>been abstracted somewhere between this and <placeName>England</placeName>. 
<lb/>But the parcel was happily unscathed. From a former 
<lb/>letter which I acknowledged, I have reason to believe 
<lb/>there is another parcel where Gilpius wig was "still upon 
<lb/>the road"<reg>.</reg> There is a wide gap in the supply of periodicals 
<lb/>but hope they will turn up in time. Accept my sincere 
<lb/>thanks for your unceasing kindness. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he different 
<lb/>periodicals sent were extremely acceptable. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Report 
<lb/>of the <unclear cert="low">Myapore</unclear> mission very interesting. We have not a 
<lb/>printer in the Bechuana mission who could equal 
<lb/>the printing of that report even in his own language<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Most of the printing has to be done by <persName>Mr. Ashton</persName> &amp; <persName>Moffat</persName>. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice> very dear way of furnishing books I suspect 
<lb/>though I have no data on which to calculate. A few of 
<lb/>the youths are being taught by <persName>Mr Ashton</persName> but they are 
<lb/>very slow. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd all the corrections have to be done by 
<lb/>the missionaries. Send another if you have opportunity 
<lb/>What! a grandson six feet high. How he would look 
<lb/>at the little doctor his uncle. I fancy I see <persName>Charles</persName> standing 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000722_0002"/><!--pb/@n='16v'-->
<lb/>on his tiptoes every time he spoke to him. It is cheering to see 
<lb/>our race is not retrograding either mentally or physically, though 
<lb/>the Puseyites poor dogs would like us to take a backward course<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>You sent no "Banners" because you perhaps thought some 
<lb/>one else would be more thankful for them. If so I can assure 
<lb/>you there is not a more thankful mortal within 100 miles 
<lb/>of me. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is saying more than you Londoners dare do<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But here we can look out and see very few better than 
<lb/>ourselves. However you may be assured that all you 
<lb/>send even Punch, is thankfully <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Inglis</persName> about whom you enquire, is settled <del type="strikethrough">about</del>
<lb/>about four days from this. We hold no communication 
<lb/>with him. When he came into the country he complained 
<lb/>mightily of the paucity of the population. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen made an 
<lb/>exploratory journey to the East of this. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>aying to me as he 
<lb/>left, Well if I don't find a population now I shall go home<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He found according to his own computation about ten 
<lb/>thousand but did not attempt to settle among them. He 
<lb/>then went south and made some arrangements with a portion 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> tribe. Returning himself to <placeName>Mabotsa</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here he remained a year waiting for the <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> to come to 
<lb/>him. As they did not appear likely to come at all I ask 
<lb/>him in Commitee what he intended doing - this gave 
<lb/>great offence but it had the effect of making him 
<lb/>leave <placeName>Mabotsa</placeName>. He then went to the East of <placeName>Mabotsa</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>sat down on a fine stream without any people 
<lb/>in the course of that year however the <term type="tribe">Boers</term> compelled 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> to shift their quarters &amp; they did not come 
<lb/>to him but to another part called <placeName>Matebe</placeName> where he now 
<lb/>is. As it was now evident to the Directors that he 
<lb/>was only wasting the Society's funds, they sent out his 
<lb/>recal to the Commmitee but conditionally provided 
<lb/>he had not by the time the letter reached the Committee 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000722_0003"/><!--pb/@n='17r'-->
<lb/>settled down in some sphere of labour. He had not "settled down 
<lb/>in a sphere of labour" <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he nearest village being nine miles 
<lb/>off but his friends insisted that he had. And as it <unclear cert="low">invoked</unclear> so 
<lb/>much to poor <persName>Inglis</persName> the rest of the com. gave in. I was not 
<lb/>there. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> came near to where he was soon 
<lb/>after the meeting of the Committee. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Directors seem 
<w>apprehs-<lb break="no"/>ive</w> that his freinds in <placeName>Scotland</placeName> would in the event of his <add place="above">re</add>call 
<lb/>do damage to the Society. It was through a whim of <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Paterson</persName>
<lb/>he became connected with the Society. He believes that the <term type="tribe">Boers</term>
<lb/>are best adapted for civilizing the natives! And still wishes 
<lb/>to appear an original. His wish is gratified in so far as the 
<lb/>possession of a few odd phrases goes. And he has sometimes 
<lb/>let out what friend <persName>MacLehose</persName> aptly termed "insane divinity" 
<lb/>(perdition of <unclear cert="low">infants</unclear>) but I can scarcely believe he is 
<lb/>sincere in believing such infinite nonsense. He propounds 
<lb/>it more to annoy others than for anything else. His case 
<lb/>is lamentable - enough to make one both sorry and afraid 
<lb/>the opportunity afforded us of standing forth as fellow 
<lb/>workers with God. In Christ's stead to entreat 
<lb/>men to be saved implies such a precious privilege 
<lb/>and such an immense responsibility as forces the 
<lb/>request to all our Christian friends Bretheren Pray 
<lb/>for us, with an intense degree of ernestness<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Are you aware that he has many connections in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>? <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he above is of course between ourselves - though I cannot 
<lb/>believe that even charity herself would say he has done 
<lb/>good in the country. Take an instance of his conduct 
<lb/>to <persName>Sechele</persName>. You know how nobly he made a profession 
<lb/>after three years diligent study &amp; consistent conduct. 
<lb/><choice><reg>M</reg><orig>m</orig></choice>ost of his people were opposed to him but he read the 
<lb/>word of God for himself and it was quite natural in 
<lb/>him to look for sympathy to Christians. Well, a short 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000722_0004"/><!--pb/@n='17v'-->
<lb/>after he was baptized, one of his people went to <placeName>Matebe</placeName> on his own 
<lb/>business and being favourably inclined to Christianity went to 
<lb/>salute the missionary. <persName>Inglis</persName> began at once to denounce 
<lb/>the man's chief as one of the worst wretches on the face of 
<lb/>the Earth - and that too in language which the man 
<lb/>would not repeat. "He never knew a white man could 
<lb/>use such language. And rather than encounter it again 
<lb/>he would disobey his chief and refuse (although ordered) to go 
<lb/>near him. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hink of this and <persName>Inglis</persName> never once saw <persName>Sechele's</persName>
<lb/>The reports he had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> were of course from <persName>Sechele's</persName>
<lb/>enemies. And the man of course told his chief the whole. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he effect on <persName>Sechele's</persName> mind will I have no doubt be 
<lb/>made apparent on judgement day. He has lately 
<lb/>been using something of the same sort of language to the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bahoutse</term> respecting their circumcision and they will 
<lb/>not look near his meeting. When <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Freeman</persName> came 
<lb/>here <persName>Inglis</persName> took care to vent out against <persName>Sechele</persName>. I suppose 
<lb/>it is his way of giving me a stroke. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hose who see and 
<lb/>converse with <persName>Sechele</persName> invaribly think a great 
<lb/>deal more of him than I do. I am always with him 
<lb/>and know his faults and failings best. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Freeman</persName>
<lb/>encouraged him to come to <placeName>England</placeName>. (at <persName>Sechele's</persName> own 
<lb/>expense) While I mindful of <persName>Mokoteri</persName> have always 
<lb/>opposed the idea. <persName>S</persName>. was mightily pleased to hear 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F</persName> approve of the project of proceeding to <placeName>England</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>By the way I mention that <persName>Mokoteri</persName> has at 
<lb/>last got a wife. A <term type="tribe">Griqua</term>, the height of his ambition<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>All the parents refused to let him have their daughters &amp; 
<lb/>some gave him a drubbing for presuming to ask them 
<lb/>but by means of seduction he has got one at last 
<lb/>the parents yielded with no very good grace you may be 
<lb/>sure. He is a rank Antinomian in sentiment </p>

<lb/><p>With respect to this country generally it is in a very sorry state 
<lb/>there is war on all sides. The <term type="tribe">Caffres</term> are at war with 
<lb/>the Colony. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Basutus</term> among whom the French 
<lb/>bretheren chiefly labour are at war among themselves 
<lb/>and with the Colonial authorities too. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> truly mean, rob the poor <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> who are 
<lb/>returning from the Colony with a few head of 
<lb/>cattle. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir hard earned wages, for work performed 
<lb/>at a distance of more than five hundred miles from 
<lb/>home. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Boers</term> knowing that the Colonial 
<lb/>Government has its hands full met yesterday 
<lb/>at <placeName>Mosega</placeName> to concoct plans for bring the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> under their authority. Which authority is to be 
<lb/>exercised in forcing them to work without pay. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is their practice among a great many tribes 
<lb/>situated East of this. Very like I shall in the 
<lb/>course of this season lose all my little property at <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName>. I think the <term type="tribe">Boers</term> will certainly attack 
<lb/>us soon. <persName>Mosilikatse</persName> on the North East seems 
<lb/>inclined to make a stir. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Damares</term> too 
<lb/>on the west Coast have been fighting &amp; one mission 
<lb/>has been broken up. Add to this there is nothing 
<lb/>doing in the country. <choice><reg>N</reg><orig>n</orig></choice>o conversions &amp; very 
<lb/>few candidates indeed even where the gospel 
<lb/>has been long established. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he only work worth 
<lb/>mentioning is the translation &amp; printing of the 
<lb/>Bible carried on by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat</persName> &amp; <persName>Ashton</persName> at the <placeName>Kuruman</placeName></p>

<lb/><p>Here we are doing little. We are hindered in our work 
<lb/>greatly by the fact that the <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> is dried completely up<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Neither we nor our people can obtain food and very 
<lb/>soon we shall be compelled to remove for want of water<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The whole <placeName>Bakwain country</placeName> is drying up. When <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Moffat</persName> visited the <unclear cert="low"><placeName>Mauketse country</placeName></unclear> as it was full of fountains 
<lb/>and there were many streams near to <placeName>Kaukoe</placeName> but when 
<lb/>we were lately there they pointed out nine streams 
<lb/>which have dried up since, and we had to send about 
<lb/>three miles off for water to cook our kettle. Our 
<lb/>people are much attached to us but we must I fear 
<lb/>part from them soon. And the only way open for 
<lb/>us is the North. I wrote you an account of 
<lb/>our second visit to the Lake. And in a few days we wend our way thither again. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he fever and 
<lb/>Mosquitoes make me quail. I look at my wife &amp; 
<lb/>children and my heart yearns intensely over them 
<lb/>you know what a parent's feelings are. I cannot 
<lb/>enter into all circumstances of the case at present 
<lb/><choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut it seems duty to go. And were I alone it would 
<lb/>not cost me a thought<reg>.</reg> But O my children. Am I 
<lb/>sacrificing them<choice><reg>?</reg><orig>.</orig></choice> Your institution at <placeName>Walthamstow</placeName>
<lb/>is certainly a noble affair. How I should be relieved 
<lb/>if I could place them there till I had alone proved 
<lb/>the salubrity of the climate. You know the African 
<lb/>fever. How it baffled the medical staff of the <placeName>Niger</placeName>
<lb/>Expedition though they had all the resources of 
<lb/>the medical art at hand. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his may be the last 
<lb/>letter I shall write you. I do not shrink for 
<lb/>myself but for those I love however we 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000722_0007"/><!--pb/@n='19r'-->
<lb/>go as soon as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> comes and we expect him 
<lb/>tomorrow. He with great generosity has supplied many 
<lb/>of our wants and will do more. I have not written 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tidman</persName> since I returned and do not now. Have 
<lb/>not heard from him for a long very long time 
<lb/>say 18 months at least, and feel as if I could 
<lb/>not carry on a correspondence without any 
<lb/>reply. I shall however send my journal - or 
<lb/>the substance of it. If you happened to meet 
<lb/>him you might inform him I had written you 
<lb/>just before departing for the North. May God be 
<lb/>gracious to you my dear friend and supply all 
<lb/>your need out of His abundant fullness. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hanks for
