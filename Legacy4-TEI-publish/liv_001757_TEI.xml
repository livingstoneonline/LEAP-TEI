<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kongone</placeName> 24<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> March </p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1862 </p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>It is clear that we 
<lb/>must look out for a new 
<lb/>Engineer. <persName><choice><sic>Hardistey</sic><corr>Hardisty</corr></choice></persName> is determined 
<lb/>to get away by a quarrel. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he first appearance of the 
<lb/>wish occured when we 
<lb/>came down to the <placeName>East Luabo</placeName>
<lb/>lately. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is a  bank called 
<lb/>By <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Inglis</persName> in his late 
<lb/>survey an "inner bar" 
<lb/>we ran aground on it at 
<lb/>low ebb, and resolved just to 
<lb/>wait till the flow. I told 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName> to have steam 
<lb/>ready at that time and when 
<lb/>she began to float all were 
<lb/>at their posts <add place="above">but</add> him - not knowing 
<lb/>this I simply called down 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001757_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>"a turn astern" and off she came - Having anchored 
<lb/>a quarter of a mile from the spot to cut wood &amp; wait 
<lb/>for a man of war. <persName>Hardisty</persName> came aft to the quarter 
<lb/>deck and demanded "Did you give orders for the 
<lb/>engines to go without a calling of me." I replied yes 
<lb/>I gave orders to you to have the steam ready and 
<lb/>did not know till now that you were not at 
<lb/>your duty. "Well I wish you to get another engineer 
<lb/>if you are going to treat me that way." I told him 
<lb/>that he was guilty of the impertinence because 
<lb/>he thought himself indispensible - and an hour 
<lb/>afterwards he came and apologized. I would 
<lb/>not have referred to this but it is evident 
<lb/>that he had made a mistake in his action 
<lb/>then, and has gone to work more systematically 
<lb/>since to make himself a nuisance, in order 
<lb/>to get away. We failed to carry 35 tons. It is quite true 
<lb/>she was top heavy and listed over often, but we left 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna</placeName> as deep and had 26 tons of coals - &amp; nearly all 
<lb/>the mission gear on deck yet came up to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>with wood in 2 days of 20 hours steaming - now 
<lb/>we took over three weeks though half the way we had coals<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We took out 5 tons and dismissed the paddle box boats 
<lb/>yet could barely stem the current in parts four and a half knots<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We could barely make one knot over the ground though 
<lb/>going in the shoal parts out of the current. Her speed ought 
<lb/>to be at least 8 or say seven. Well even that would 
<lb/>give about 3 over the ground, but every one saw 
<lb/>the Engines were not properly worked and I suppose 
<lb/>some of the 6 officers of the Gorgon had let <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> H.</persName>
<lb/>know what he thought. We came several times 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001757_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>to a stand still, and observing <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>H.</persName> sitting on deck quietly smoking 
<lb/>I asked him what was the matter 
<lb/>with the engines - "It<reg>'</reg>s the list over" 
<lb/>was the reply. He then went into 
<lb/>the engine room and made 
<lb/>them go better. An hour afterwards 
<lb/>the same thing occurred &amp; I saw 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName> lying on the engine 
<lb/>sky lights asleep. I asked him 
<lb/>why he did not attend to the 
<lb/>engines. He went down again &amp;
<lb/>an hour after he went on the 
<lb/>sick list! <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Rae</persName> then screwed 
<lb/>up the packing of the cylinders &amp; 
<lb/>mended the feed pump which 
<lb/>unknown to me had been 
<lb/>left broken all the time we were 
<lb/>lying waiting at <placeName>Luabo</placeName> and 
<lb/>while loading in the <placeName>Kongone</placeName> - and the speed was increased by 
<lb/>four revolutions per minute 
<lb/>of course pumping in cold 
<lb/>water had been so much loss 
<lb/>of fuel. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> suspected 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001757_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>that a certain valve was not 
<lb/>working - but <persName>Hardisty</persName> soon 
<lb/>came out of the sick list &amp; 
<lb/>we were reduced to our former 
<lb/>speed. When we resolved to 
<lb/>unload a deal of tinkering 
<lb/>took place in the engine 
<lb/>room - and knowing the 
<lb/>engineer to be very touchy 
<lb/>I refrained examining 
<lb/>what was done. But we 
<lb/>came down to the <placeName>Kongone</placeName>
<lb/>from <add place="above">above Mazaro</add> in 8 or 9 hours 
<lb/>shewing a speed or at 
<lb/>least six knots - 10 with 
<lb/>the current over the ground. 
<lb/>And then <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hardisty</persName> came 
<lb/>and said "I wish an 
<lb/>inspection of the engines 
<lb/>and as you are disatisfied 
<lb/>with me send me home "<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001757_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'-->
<lb/>This after the tinkering and after I had carefully 
<lb/>abstained from saying a word to him. I replied 
<lb/>that I had been disappointed at not getting up 
<lb/>and <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> the assistance of the officers &amp; men 
<lb/>who had come with us, but had never uttered 
<lb/>a word of dissatisfaction to him. I confess that 
<lb/>I felt it but never expressed it, or shewed it. </p>
<lb/><p>He has since set up his back against <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Young</persName> and answers him in the most impertinent 
<lb/>way, for instance, <persName>Hardisty</persName> had placed several 
<lb/>bags of charcoal on the boiler casing and <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Y.</persName>
<lb/>in giving the whole ship a thorough cleaning &amp; 
<lb/>white washing asked me if he might place some 
<lb/>small boxes of shot on them till he found a better 
<lb/>place. I replied yes. When <persName>Hardisty</persName> saw that he 
<lb/>came and bawled out before <persName>Captain Wilson</persName>
<lb/>and his officers to me, that "he had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>orders (I suppose he meant from you) not to 
<lb/>allow anything there. And if you don<reg>'</reg>t allow 
<lb/>me my position in the ship, send me home, 
<lb/><persName>Captain Washington</persName><choice><sic>garanteed</sic><corr>guaranteed</corr></choice> me here only 
<lb/>one year." &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c." of course I adhered to 
<lb/>what I had allowed <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Young</persName> to do feeling 
<lb/>sure that you had given no such orders &amp; 
<lb/>no one else had a right to give any. He has 
<lb/>also sat at table contradicting everything he can 
<lb/>say a word against - no one replies - and has 
<lb/>besides tried to create disturbance with <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName>
<lb/>by the falsehood that he has been asked to put 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001757_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'-->
<lb/>the Lady Nyassa together <reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><persName>Captain Wilson</persName> who has 
<lb/>been a witness of his impertinence 
<lb/>says that he will tell the 
<lb/>admiral and another engineer 
<lb/>will be sent up. I see plainly 
<lb/>that matters with <persName>Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>will get worse &amp; worse - and 
<lb/>will be glad if another is sent 
<lb/>by the admiral who will be 
<lb/>amenable to naval discipline 
<lb/>because while <persName>Hardisty</persName> is 
<lb/>here I shall make him do his 
<lb/>duty though it be by bread &amp;
<lb/>water or leaving him on an 
<lb/>island. He expects that he 
<lb/>must get a year<reg>'</reg>s pay whenever 
<lb/>he leaves - if that is the case it 
<lb/>ought to be altered. He has taken 
<lb/>to this course of conduct entirely 
<lb/>unprovoked &amp; in the opinion of 
<lb/>us all is inexcusable<reg>.</reg></p>
