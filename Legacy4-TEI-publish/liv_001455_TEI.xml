<lb/><p>In endeavouring to form 
<lb/>an estimate of the value of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>for commercial purposes, <add place="above">it is necessary to recollect</add> we were 
<lb/>obliged in the first instance to trust 
<lb/>to the opinions of naval officers 
<lb/>who had visited it; and the late 
<lb/><persName>Captain Parker</persName> together with <persName>Lieutenant 
<lb/>Hoskins</persName> having declared that it was 
<lb/>quite capable of being used for 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>merce,</w> though the Portuguese never 
<lb/>did, and do not now enter it directly 
<lb/>from the sea, we trusted in the testimony 
<lb/>of our countrymen, and though we 
<lb/>failed to find a passage in by 
<lb/><persName>Parker's</persName><placeName>Luabo</placeName>, we discovered a 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">a</del> safe entrance by the branch 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone</placeName>; and <term type="boat">H. M. S. Lynx</term>, 
<lb/><persName>Captain <choice><sic>Berkely</sic><corr>Berkeley</corr></choice></persName>, at a subsequent 
<lb/>period, found a good channel 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001455_0003"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>by the main stream (<persName>Parker<reg>'</reg>s</persName><placeName>Luabo</placeName>) though 
<lb/>we had failed to observe it in a three 
<lb/>days search. The question of safe entrance 
<lb/>from the sea having thus been satisfactorily 
<lb/>solved, our attention was next directed 
<lb/>to the rest of the river - the subject of 
<lb/>his report.</p>
<lb/><p><add place="inline" hand="#hand02">It is desirable also to 
<lb/>remember that</add><choice> <reg>I</reg><orig>i</orig></choice>n an experimental Expedition 
<lb/>like ours, it was plainly an imperative 
<lb/>duty to select the most healthy period 
<lb/>of the year in order to avoid the fate 
<lb/>of the Great Niger Expedition. Had we 
<lb/>come any time between January and 
<lb/>April, a large vessel could have been 
<lb/>taken up as far as <placeName>Tette</placeName>, but <add place="above">that</add> is the 
<lb/>most unhealthy time of the year, and 
<lb/>we then looked on the African fever 
<lb/>as a much more formidable disease 
<lb/>than we do now. We entered the river 
<lb/>in June, when the river was falling 
<lb/>fast, but even then, the official 
<lb/>reports of <persName>Captain Gordon</persName> R. N. and 
<lb/>other naval officers, were  precisely 
<lb/>the same as those of <persName>Captain Parker</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Lieutenant Hoskins</persName>. Their 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001455_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>testimony however, referred to only about 
<lb/>seventy miles from the sea - Mazaro - the 
<lb/>point at which the Portuguese use of the 
<lb/>river begins. We have now enjoyed a 
<lb/>twelvemonths experience, which is the shortest 
<lb/>period in which all the changes that occur 
<lb/>annually, can be noted, and we have 
<lb/>carefully examined the <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">whole, without 
<lb/>attempting any regular survey</del> from the 
<lb/>sea to <placeName>Tette</placeName> five times over, in a 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">shaky</del> craft<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">of the Niger canoe or 
<lb/>pot-bellied shape,</del> the top speed of which 
<lb/>(3 1/2 knots)<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> admitted of nothing being 
<lb/>done in a hurry; and may therefore 
<lb/>be considered in a position to give 
<lb/>an opinion of equal value to that of flying 
<lb/>visitors, better qualified in all other respects 
<lb/>for the task. <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">As it was expected that 
<lb/>my companions should collect fuller 
<lb/>information than I could formerly 
<lb/>furnish, and</del> <add place="above" hand="#hand02">As</add> a report on the river would 
<lb/>be incomplete without a description 
<lb/>of it when at its lowest, I sent the 
<lb/>journal of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><add place="inline" hand="#hand02">T.</add> Baines</persName> to the <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">R. G. S. </del> <add place="above" hand="#hand02">Society</add>
<lb/>which was written at the worst part 
<lb/>of the river, and in a season said by all 
<lb/>to be one of unusual drought. 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001455_0005"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> B.<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">aines</add></persName> was taken up by a southern 
<lb/>channel which contained much less water 
<lb/>than that which we ascended a month 
<lb/>later but adopting that journal as 
<lb/>shewing what the river may again 
<lb/>become in a season of drought. I would 
<lb/>only add that in passing from the sea 
<lb/>to <placeName>Tette</placeName>, when the river had fallen still 
<lb/>lower than at the period when the journal 
<lb/>was penned, we were obliged to drag the 
<lb/>vessel over three crossings 100 or 150 feet 
<lb/>long of from 24 to 18 inches of water. 
<lb/>It is not however to be understood that 
<lb/>such is then the general depth. In the broad 
<lb/>parts of the river we have three or four 
<lb/>channels, and the greater part of these channels 
<lb/>contains water from 8 to 15 feet deep, even 
<lb/>when the river has reached its lowest ebb. 
<lb/>But we are often obliged to cross 
<lb/>from one channel to another, 
<lb/>and sometimes from one bank 
<lb/>to the other, and it is in these 
<lb/>crossings that the difficulties occur. 
<lb/>I am not aware that anything has 
<lb/>been written o<del type="overwritten">f</del><add place="over-text">n</add> the form of the bottoms 
<lb/>of rivers, but familiarity with that &amp; the 
<lb/>signs on the surface, will enable one man 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">will enable one man</del> to fine three fathoms, while 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001455_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3r'--> 
<lb/>another will run aground on one 
<lb/>or two feet. From our experience 
<lb/>of a year in which the river was 
<lb/>unusually low<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> and the rise deferred 
<lb/>to a later than ordinary period, it is 
<lb/>certain that a vessel really of 18 inches 
<lb/>or two feet <add place="above">draught</add> could ply at all seasons 
<lb/>on the first 300 miles of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>At my suggestion a tide pole 
<lb/>was planted at <placeName>Tette</placeName> by <persName>Major Secard</persName>
<lb/>and the lowest point the river 
<lb/>reached in November /58 - that in 
<lb/>which 18 inches were found in <del type="strikethrough">the</del> <add place="above">a</add>
<lb/><add place="inline">few</add> crossings, adopted as the low water 
<lb/>mark. By careful measurement 
<lb/>with the theodolite the river was 
<lb/>found at that point to be (964) 
<lb/>nine hundred and sixty four yards 
<lb/>from bank to bank, which if 
<lb/>I remember rightly is more than 
<lb/>twice the width of the Thames at 
<lb/><placeName>London Bridge</placeName>. At its lowest 
<lb/>ebb it contained between 300 &amp; 
<lb/>400 yards of water of various 
<lb/>depths. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he deep channel of 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001455_0007"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/>this, in which the vessel lay, was from 
<lb/>twelve to fifteen feet deep. As it enables 
<lb/>one to form a clear idea on the subject 
<lb/>I may mention that we lost an anchor 
<lb/>there when the water rose<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> and the volume 
<lb/>of water being always considerable<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> we 
<lb/>have no hope of getting it again by 
<lb/>being left high and dry as a ship is 
<lb/>represented at her anchorage in the 
<lb/><placeName>Niger</placeName><reg>.</reg><note n="*" anchored="true"><persName>Laird</persName> &amp; <persName>Oldfield's</persName> book (?)</note> At <placeName>Shuramba <unclear cert="medium">Dembe</unclear></placeName>
<lb/>the river is 3490 yards wide or 
<lb/>1 3/4 geographical miles, nearly. 
<lb/>At <placeName>Shigogo</placeName> it is broader probably 
<lb/>three miles<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> but large islands 
<lb/>divide it into five or six channels. 
<lb/>It is evident that with such an 
<lb/>amount of spread, if the current 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> were very rapid, 
<lb/>a rise of several feet at <placeName>Tette</placeName> would 
<lb/>be of comparatively small value 
<lb/>at <placeName>Shigago</placeName>. We therefore took the 
<lb/>precaution of marking a perpendicular 
<lb/>rock at the East end of <placeName>Lupata</placeName>, adopting 
<lb/>as at <placeName>Tette</placeName> the top of 18 inches at the 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001455_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4r'--> 
<lb/>crossings as low water mark and carefully 
<lb/>measured the velocity of the stream at the 
<lb/>most rapid parts we knew. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he result 
<lb/>obtained both by patent and common logs 
<lb/>was that no part of the river below <placeName>Kebrabasa</placeName>
<lb/>has a current of four knots. We were 
<lb/>particularly suspicious as to the correctness 
<lb/>of this result as some of our naval 
<lb/>friends<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> judging from sight only<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> spoke 
<lb/>of six and even eight knots. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut

<lb/>barely stem<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> shewed no more than 
<lb/>3 1/4 knots. The general current 
<lb/>is 2 1/4 knots and under. The 
<lb/>heights of the river observed by 
<lb/><persName>Major Secard</persName> in the accompanying 
<lb/>table and by ourselves at <placeName>Lupata</placeName>
<lb/>and elsewhere<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> may therefore be 
<lb/>considered as applicable to the 
<lb/>whole stream. The amount of fall 
<lb/>noticed also in the table, being 
<lb/>only once down to 7 1/2 feet 
<lb/>shews that the character of 

	<pb n="0009" facs="liv_001455_0009"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>mountain torrent cannot be applied 
<lb/>to the noble <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> any more 
<lb/>than it can be to the <placeName>Nile</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>From November to January 
<lb/>the river rose gradually to 8 feet 
<lb/>above low water mark. From 
<lb/>the 15<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> January to the 15<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> May 
<lb/>it had depth enough for a large 
<lb/>vessel. Though <persName>Major Secard</persName>
<lb/>remarks that this year it attained 
<lb/>only a minimum height and 
<lb/>the accuracy of this is confirmed 
<lb/>by the fact that only a small 
<lb/>quantity of wheat is sown 
<lb/>the parts flooded by the river 
<lb/>being the parts employed for 
<lb/>the crop. The data now submitted 
<lb/>appear to prove that a vessel of 
<lb/>two feet draught, such as are 
<lb/>necessary for the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> could 
<lb/>run the whole of ordinary years. 
<lb/>We knew of no other observations 
<lb/>on which the navigability or non navigability 
<lb/>of the river can be pronounced upon but leave 
<lb/>them for the consideration of 

	<pb n="0010" facs="liv_001455_0010"/><!--pb/@n='5r'--> 
<lb/><choice><sic>of</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> those better qualified to give an 
<lb/>opinion.</p>
<lb/><p>We have in the course of one year 
<lb/>cut up into small pieces upwards 
<lb/>of one hundred and fifty tons 
<lb/>of lignum vitae alone, which 
<lb/>according to the average prices 
<lb/>in London during 1858 was 
<lb/>worth about £900. This wood 
<lb/>when dry was, in the absence 
<lb/>of coal, the only fuel with which 
<lb/>we could get up steam<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> owing 
<lb/>to the boiler tubes being singularly 
<lb/>placed all on one side and 
<lb/>chiefly below the level of the 
<lb/>fire<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> from which novel 
<w>arrange-<lb break="no"/>ment</w> one side remains long cold 
<lb/>while the other is hot like a patient 
<lb/>in the palsy; and four &amp; a half 
<lb/>or five mortal hours of fuel 
<lb/>burning are required to get up 
<lb/>steam - yet by incessant labour 
<lb/>and a dogged determination to

<lb/>extract all the good <add place="above">possible</add> out of an engine 
<lb/>probably intended to grind coffee in 
<lb/>a shop window, we have traversed 
<lb/>2350 miles of river. Now had 
<lb/>we been permitted to shew what 
<lb/>could be effected in this one 
<lb/>branch of commerce, it is not 
<lb/>unreasonable to say that every 
<lb/>time the saw went through 
<lb/>lignum vitae it might have been 
<lb/>to secure or dress a log. Without 
<lb/>any great labour we might have cut 
<lb/>a thousand instead of one hundred 
<lb/>and fifty tons of that valuable 
<lb/>wood, and given a practical 
<lb/>exposition of what may and 
<lb/>very probably soon will be 
<lb/>effected by the Germans 
<lb/>in <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> commerce.</p>
<lb/><p>The only paper that reached 
<lb/>us up to the middle of June 
<lb/>last<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> contained a short notice 
<lb/>of <del type="overwritten" hand="#hand02">a</del><add place="over-text" hand="#hand02">the</add> meeting of the Royal Geographical

<lb/>with a pretty theory, and an engineering 
<lb/>flaw, that the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> which under 
<lb/>the very serious disadvantages of that 
<lb/>flaw, we have actually been navigating, 
<lb/>was not navigable at all. If our 
<lb/>fellow members will only believe

<lb/>I succeed in inducing the better 
<lb/>qualified among your members 
<lb/>either to point out what has already 
<lb/>been done in describing the bottom 
<lb/>of rivers, or <add place="above">in</add> working out the subject 
<lb/>which I have but touched on, I shall 
<lb/>not have incurred the charge of 
<lb/>presumption in vain. In July 
<lb/>last year we ran aground 
<lb/>perpetually by going ahead 
<lb/>straight. While in September 
<lb/>when the river was much 
<lb/>lower, <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Medlycott</persName> of <term type="boat">H.M.S. 
<lb/>Lynx</term> seemed to know the kwettes &amp; 
<lb/>banks intuitively, and never 
<lb/>touched at all.</p>
<lb/><p>The<del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">se</del> submerged sandbanks, 
<lb/>as on the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, are the greatest 
<lb/>difficulty in <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> navigation. 
<lb/>Each river has its own disadvantages. 
<lb/>The <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> has its snags, &amp; it is said 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">and</del> requires vessels of a peculiar 
<lb/>build and only two feet draught. 
<lb/>The <placeName>Hoogley</placeName> has its own very peculiar 
<lb/>difficulties of entrance &amp; so has the 
<lb/>landing place at <placeName>Madras</placeName>; But 

	<pb n="0018" facs="liv_001455_0018"/><!--pb/@n='9r'--> 
<lb/>difficulties are not impossibilities. 
<lb/>A great difficulty - the <term type="ailment">African 
<lb/>fever</term>, is, we hope, rendered 
<lb/>less formidable, and in spite 
<lb/>of the theory that Europeans 
<lb/>cannot live and labour in 
<lb/>the tropics, we find that hard 
<lb/>work, with the good food most 
<lb/>conscientiously supplied by 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Wilson</persName> of <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>, and 
<lb/>a merry heart, have secured 
<lb/>as fair a share of health as we 
<lb/>should have had in London.</p>
<lb/><p>From October 1858 to June 
<lb/>1859, 5782 Elephants<reg>'</reg> tusks 
<lb/>have gone down the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>from <placeName>Tette</placeName> alone, of these 
<lb/>two thirds were large or upwards 
<lb/>of 50 lbs each, the weight of the 
<lb/>whole were in round numbers 
<lb/>100 000 lbs. All merchandise 
<lb/>is carried in large unwieldy canoes 

	<pb n="0019" facs="liv_001455_0019"/><!--pb/@n='9v'--> 
<lb/>which cost between £60 &amp; £70 each<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>When loaded they draw about two 
<lb/>feet and carry two tons at an 
<lb/>expense of £10 sterling from 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimaine</placeName> to <placeName>Tette</placeName><add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> when the 
<lb/>river is full. When the small 
<lb/>channel between the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>and the <placeName>Quilimaine river</placeName> is 
<lb/>dry<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> which is the case at least 
<lb/>nine months in the year<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> the 
<lb/>expense is much increased by 
<lb/>the land carriage to <placeName>Mazaro</placeName>. 
<lb/>English manufactured goods 
<lb/>come in a round about way 
<lb/>by Banian or Gentoo traders 
<lb/>from <placeName>Bombay</placeName> - and they are 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">able</del> <add place="above" hand="#hand02">obliged</add> to give <del type="strikethrough">a</del> larger prices for 
<lb/>ivory than the Americans<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add>
<lb/>who are absorbing all the trade 
<lb/>of Eastern Africa. Several <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>merchants have been waiting at 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimaine</placeName> for months in 
<lb/>expectation of American ships 

	<pb n="0020" facs="liv_001455_0020"/><!--pb/@n='10r'--> 
<lb/>with cottons. For the information of 
<lb/>mercantile men it may be added 
<lb/>that the American calicoes are 
<lb/>coarse, unbleached, yard wide cottons, 
<lb/>costing at <placeName>Quilimaine</placeName> between 5<hi rend="sup">d</hi> &amp; 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
<lb/>per yard - and muskets, inferior 
<lb/>to English trade arms, from 
<lb/>26/ to 36/ each. With calicoes, 
<lb/>guns and gunpowder, they 
<lb/>easily secure all the trade on 
<lb/>the East coast below <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>No attempt is made to encourage 
<lb/>the native taste for better 
<lb/>articles<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">,</add> which exists quite as 
<lb/>strongly here as on the West 
<lb/>coast. <!-- TRANSC: deletion and stet not transcribed-->Red and blue colours
