<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>River Zambesi</placeName> 15<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1862</p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Admiral Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>We came from <placeName>Johanna</placeName> to the 
<lb/>Latitude of the <placeName>Kongone</placeName> in five days during 
<lb/>two which without steam and a light head 
<lb/>wind we were carried 60 miles a day. 
<lb/>Our coals were expended when we made the 
<lb/>land. We could have gone into <placeName>Namiara</placeName>
<lb/>or <placeName>Nyamiara</placeName> a double mouthed port about 
<lb/>30 miles from <placeName>Luabo</placeName> but were afraid to run 
<lb/>a risk in a spot we did not know except 
<lb/>by Portuguese reports with wind blowing 
<lb/>freshly on shore, so we bore away with 
<lb/>sails to <placeName>Quilimaine River</placeName> - cut wood 
<lb/>there, and came round to <placeName>Kongone</placeName>. We 
<lb/>find the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> very low but the water 
<lb/>is rising, and we shall be towing the <term type="boat">Lady 
<lb/>Nyassa</term> up in about a week. I shall feel 
<lb/>immensely relieved when fairly at that 
<lb/>work. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he oxen &amp; mules are in good 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>dition</w> and promise fairly to facilitate 
<lb/>our labours.</p>
<lb/><p>Thanks for <persName>Captain <unclear cert="low">Maury's</unclear></persName> work. 
<lb/>It is exceedingly interesting. Had we possessed 
<lb/>it sooner we should have looked abroad 
<lb/>with more intelligent interest - the black 
<lb/>indigo colour of the sea tells when we are 
<lb/>in the current - we noticed this both in 
<lb/>going and coming. In the hollow south of 
<lb/><placeName>Mosambique</placeName> &amp; west of 38º E. there seems to 
<lb/>be no current except near the shore 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001854_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>and there it is towards the North. We have 
<lb/>been twice <choice><sic>decieved</sic><corr>deceived</corr></choice> by being too clever - 
<lb/>making allowance for a current to the 
<lb/>south and finding we made the land 
<lb/>just where we steered for North of our 
<lb/>port.</p>
<lb/><p>My Chief object in writing at present 
<lb/>is to beg you to transmit (£10) Ten Pounds 
<lb/>from <persName>Quarter-master Collyer</persName> to <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi>
<lb/>Collyer</persName> 13 Bilbury St. Plymouth 
<lb/>to be payable at Devonport Dockyard 
<lb/>this sum is additional to what she has 
<lb/>been regularly drawing<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Also to <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> Magrath</persName> Ten Pounds 
<lb/>(£10) from <persName>Q<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Master Magrath</persName> - this too 
<lb/>is additional - her address is <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi>
<lb/>Magrath</persName>. Dawlish; Devonshire:</p>
<lb/><p>And to <persName>Sarah Jane Saunders</persName>
<lb/>from our carpenter to be drawn as 
<lb/>additional to what she now draws 
<lb/>at Portsmouth Dockyard, Five Pounds 
<lb/>(£5) her address is - <persName>Sarah Jane 
<lb/>Saunders</persName> 16 Plymouth St. Southsea.</p>
<lb/><p>Also £5. to <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> Pearce</persName>, 46 Albion 
<lb/>Brighton - she is mother of the man 
<lb/>who sends it and does not draw anything 
<lb/>regularly - we <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> him from the 
<lb/><term type="boat">Ariel</term>. All are well behaved men.</p>

<lb/><p>We hear that <persName>Thornton</persName> is up at 
<lb/><placeName>Senna</placeName> waiting I suppose for some one 
<lb/>to take him to <placeName>Gorongoza</placeName> - mountains 
<lb/>with inscriptions west of that village<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We did not take him with us to 
<lb/>the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> because we left 
<lb/>with the intention of going down to 
<lb/>the sea for provisions only and 
<lb/>to send home our Johanna crew<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We have eleven new Johanna men 
<lb/>at Kroomen's wages - they promise 
<lb/>to be very useful. They scarcely 
<lb/>ever have fever and don<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>fraternize with the natives.</p>
<lb/><p>I see Pocket Aneroids mentioned 
<lb/>in the Journal of the Society of Arts, 
<lb/>we were unfortunate enough to 
<lb/>break 2 common barometers - one 
<lb/>by a hawser light dropping down 
<lb/>the skylight and other by two natives 
<lb/>fighting and tumbling down into the 
<lb/>saloon. Will you favour us 
<lb/>with a couple of pocket Aneroids 
<lb/>they are by Mess<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> Frankham &amp; 
<lb/>Wilson of Wilson St. Grays <choice><reg>I</reg><orig>i</orig></choice>nn Road 
<lb/>and are mentioned in the journal 
<lb/>for May 16<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> 1862. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are said to 
<lb/>be improvements but you will be 
<lb/>able to judge whether there is anything 
<lb/>in this - the mountain Barometer

<lb/>came out smashed &amp; so was one of the 
<lb/>boiling point instruments - <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> May</persName> brought 
<lb/>no fowling pieces - my private one is 
<lb/>much too heavy. Indeed it is an elephant 
<lb/>gun as well, I bought another fowling 
<lb/>piece lighter for £10 (private) and it does 
<lb/>not carry well. Both those we brought 
<lb/>from Gov<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">t</hi></hi> were very good but one 
<lb/>is quite used up. </p>
<lb/><p>We shall not come down till 
<lb/>January of <choice><sic>£1864</sic><corr>1864</corr></choice>. Our fresh meats 
<lb/>and groceries will then be quite 
<lb/>done. Please think of this at your 
<lb/>convenience.</p>
<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> mission is about 
<lb/>to be renewed. <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Moffat senior</persName> who 
<lb/>established one with <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> will 
<lb/>probably help and so will his son. 
<lb/>Poor <persName>Helmore</persName> &amp; his party it turns out 
<lb/>used no medicine except a little 
<lb/>Dover's powder!</p>
<lb/><p>Two carpenters - Two masons - one 
<lb/>smith and a headman - an Englishman 
<lb/>(the rest being Scotch) set out from 
<lb/>London to form a settlement near us, 
<lb/>working at their trades the wages going to 
<lb/>a common fund: they bought two <choice><sic>waggons</sic><corr>wagons</corr></choice>
<lb/>and were proposing to go overland when 
<lb/>the magistrate who testifies to their good 
<lb/>conduct at <placeName>Ahival North, Cape Colony</placeName>
<lb/>laid the case before the Governor. His 
<lb/>Excellency consulted me about sending 
<lb/>them by sea. They seem to be the men who 
<lb/>will suit our plans much better than 
<lb/>those who have been employed by the 
<lb/>mission of the Universities<reg>.</reg></p>
