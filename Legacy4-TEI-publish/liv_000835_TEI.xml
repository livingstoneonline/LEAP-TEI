<lb/><placeName>Leeba</placeName> comes from the North, so we 
<lb/>supposed that by ascending it we should

<lb/>and Angola got a bad name in the mercantile

<lb/>been made since. Still, with the same difficulties

<lb/>English manufactures, taken in exchange

<lb/>to Lisbon, and again thence to London. 
<lb/>And as the same round of expenses is incurred 
<lb/>on English manufactures, a British merchant 
<lb/>carrying merchandise direct to and from England 
<lb/>and dealing in <placeName>Loanda</placeName> in a liberal spirit, 
<lb/>would almost certainly establish a lucrative
