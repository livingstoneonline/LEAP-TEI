<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>General Hay</persName></p>
<lb/><p>It was extremely 
<lb/>kind in you to remember me, 
<lb/>as you have done. I have had good 
<lb/>reason to remember you, and 
<lb/>though you have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> no 
<lb/>evidence of it again &amp; again and 
<lb/>again has it been brought to my 
<lb/>recollection how much I owe 
<lb/>to you and your delightful home 
<lb/>in the <placeName>Mauritius</placeName>. Indeed you 
<lb/>set me so completely up, that 
<lb/>all the tear &amp; wear of a fearful 
<lb/>lionizing, though it wearied me 
<lb/>sorely, never broke me down, 
<lb/>and I have not had one 
<lb/>severe attack of fever since 
<lb/>my return. Had I gone home 
<lb/>at once in 1856 and gone through 
<lb/>the terrible ordeal, then come out 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001591_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>I could not have done the work I do 
<lb/>now. We have just finished a 
<lb/>march of 1400 miles in six months. 
<lb/>We went up the river in order to 
<lb/>return the Makololo to their own land 
<lb/>keeping along the North bank of the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> till we were in Lat. 17ยบ 18โฒ South 
<lb/>and about 28ยบ East Long. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen turned 
<lb/>away Westward ascending the 
<lb/>Highlands near <placeName>Tabacheu</placeName> where 
<lb/>we saw hoar frost &amp; a little ice 
<lb/>then descended Westwards into the 
<lb/>great central valley, to our old friends 
<lb/>the Makololo. When within 20 miles 
<lb/>of the Falls which I named after our 
<lb/>Queen we saw the columns of smoke 
<lb/>and went down to see this great 
<lb/>sight. I have no hesitation now 
<lb/>in saying that there is none equal to 
<lb/>it in strangeness in the world. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>breadth is not one but nearly two 
<lb/>thousand yards and it falls sheer 
<lb/>down 310 feet. The river was very 
<lb/>low and we could see everything clearly<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The whole river leaps into a crack &amp; this 
<lb/>crack is prolonged in the most fantastic 
<lb/>manner - the country below or East of 
<lb/>the falls being quite as high as the lip over 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001591_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>which the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> rolls - try if you can 
<lb/>understand this scrawl. All these <figure><!--diagram--></figure>
<lb/>promontories are of the same 
<lb/>level as the bed of the river 
<lb/>above the falls and <del type="strikethrough">and</del>
<lb/>over 300 feet sheer down 
<lb/>has the river of a mile wide 
<lb/>jammed into a crack some eighty or 
<lb/>100 feet wide at the bottom. A most 
<lb/>extensive coal field extends from below 
<lb/><placeName>Tette</placeName> to near <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName>. In some places 
<lb/>a steamer could load out of the seam in 
<lb/>the bank of the river. These falls will 
<lb/>be visited and coal worked when we are 
<lb/>no longer here to write &amp; talk about them<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I hail with great satisfaction the 
<lb/>formation of the <placeName>Oxford</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Cambridge</placeName>
<lb/>mission, and I shall count it a 
<lb/>privilege to do whatever I can to aid 
<lb/>the Bishop and his clergy. It was the 
<lb/>best news I have heard in <placeName>Africa</placeName>
<lb/>and most heartily do I thank Him 
<lb/>who has put the good purpose into 
<lb/>his servants<reg>'</reg> hearts. No where do 
<lb/>people stand more in need of christianity 
<lb/>and civilization than the Africans 
<lb/>and if this mission is carried on 
<lb/>with faith &amp; patience there is no 
<lb/>doubt but good will eventually be 
<lb/>done both to <placeName>Africa</placeName> &amp; <placeName>England</placeName>. 
<lb/>It seems to me that we ought in all 
<lb/>our plans for the good of others 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001591_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>specially remember our own home 
<lb/>poor - our honest poor - This leads me 
<lb/>to think of a small colony as likely to do 
<lb/>immense good. Accompanied as it 
<lb/>will be by this mission with the religious 
<lb/>element I do not apprehend those frightful 
<lb/>scenes which have occurred elsewhere 
<lb/>(except <placeName>New Zealand</placeName>). As for the poor 
<lb/>Portuguese, I must say nothing, but you 
<lb/>"can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear" 
<lb/></p>
<lb/><p>We found the chief <persName>Sekeletu</persName> labouring 
<lb/>under a skin disease believed to be leprosy 
<lb/>the effect of course of witchcraft &amp; several 
<lb/>influential head men had been put to 
<lb/>death for the crime. We tried to put him 
<lb/>to rights during our short stay and his 
<lb/>spirits revived. We found that a 
<lb/>missionary party from the London 
<lb/>Society had been nearly <add place="above">all</add> cut off by fever 
<lb/>at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>. I regret this extremely 
<lb/>as the very time they were perishing 
<lb/>we at a lower &amp; more unhealthy 
<lb/>part of the river were curing the disease 
<lb/>so quickly that a patient would be 
<lb/>stricken down and resume his march 
<lb/>on foot a day or at most two 
<lb/>after the operation of the remedy. This 
<lb/>remedy I found effectual as long ago 
<lb/>as 1850 and ever since I have not lost 
<lb/>a case but I forbore to puff. I could 
<lb/>not be a quack and grieve now that 
<lb/>the missionaries did not know it. 
<lb/>We publish the composition now. Do drop 
<lb/>me a line at your leizure &amp; you will oblige<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>yours affectionately <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
