<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Bombay</placeName>- 28 Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> 1865 </p>
<lb/><p>My Lord, 
<lb/>I have had the honour to inform Y. L. that 
<lb/>having arrived here on the 11<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> Sept<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> I spent 
<lb/>some time in organizing my expedition for 
<lb/>the interior of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, &amp; was ready to start 
<lb/>6 weeks ago. </p>
<lb/><p>On again visiting my little steamer, I 
<lb/>came to the conclusion that she was much 
<lb/>too small to recross the 2700 miles between 
<lb/>this and the river <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>, &amp; that it w<hi rend="sup">d</hi> be 
<lb/>unwise again to incur the risk of that - 
<lb/>navigation for the sake of using her on the 
<lb/>150 miles of that river wh<hi rend="sup">h</hi> is navigable. </p>
<lb/><p>I therefore waited, in the hope of hearing 
<lb/>of a passage in a man-of-war, in accordance 
<lb/>with a request made by the For<hi rend="sup">n</hi> office to 
<lb/>the Admiralty, but received no information 
<lb/>till the arrival of <persName>Comm<hi rend="sup underline">re</hi> Montresor</persName>a 
<lb/>week ago, when it appeared that the first 
<lb/>ship proceeding to the E. Coast w<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> not be 
<lb/>here for another month. <persName>H. E. Sir Bartle 
<lb/>Frere</persName>, however, having given me the option 
<lb/>of a passage in a small steamer, named 
<lb/>"Thule", wh<hi rend="sup underline">h</hi> is to be sent in a few days as <fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">a</fw>

<lb/>a  present 
<lb/>from this Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi> to the <persName>Sultan of 
<lb/>Zanzibar</persName>, I shall gladly avail myself of 
<lb/>this conveyance. </p>
<lb/><p>By the favour of <persName>H. E. the Gov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi></persName> I have 12 
<lb/>sepoy volunteers &amp; a native officer from the 
<lb/>Marine Battalion, who having served as 
<lb/>marines in the old East Indian Navy in the 
<lb/><placeName>Persian Gulph</placeName> &amp; on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> are 
<lb/>prepared to undergo hardship, &amp; it has been 
<lb/>kindly arranged that this work will 
<lb/>count as service. </p>
<lb/><p>In addition to these, 8 liberated Africans, 
<lb/>who have received some education at a 
<lb/>gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi> school at <placeName>Nassick</placeName>, and been taught 
<lb/>carpenter &amp; smith's work, have also 
<lb/>volunteered to serve. </p>
<lb/><p>The most serious drawback to 
<lb/>travelling in <placeName>Africa</placeName> is the want of carriage 
<lb/>&amp; beasts of burden. The insect called 
<lb/>"<hi rend="underline">tsetse</hi>", by destroying domestic animals, 
<lb/>confines cattle to very limited areas of 
<lb/>country. As wild buffaloes are not injured 
<lb/>by the bite of this pest, it occured to me to 
<lb/>try whether the tame buffalo of <placeName>India</placeName> might 
<lb/>not enjoy the same immunity, &amp; by the very 
<lb/>friendly assistance of <persName>H. H. the Sultan of 
<lb/>Zanzibar</persName>, who wrote an order to the Captain 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">of</fw>

<lb/>of one of His Ships with his own hand to 
<lb/>convey what I might send on board. I 
<lb/>despatched 14 of these animals to be used 
<lb/>as beasts of burden, &amp; as an experiment to see 
<lb/>if they can withstand the insect poison. The 
<lb/>tame buffalo of <placeName>India</placeName> resembles the wild 
<lb/>one of <placeName>Africa</placeName> so closely that they must be 
<lb/>more than half brothers, &amp; should we succeed 
<lb/>in introducing a beast of burden it will be a 
<lb/>boon to the country, &amp; by rendering strangers 
<lb/>almost independent of native carriers 
<lb/>a blessing to travellers. The experiment at any 
<lb/>rate is worth the expense. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>H. E. Sir B. Frere</persName> has done everything in his 
<lb/>power to aid my progress &amp; shewn more 
<lb/>kindness than I can express. Through his 
<lb/>influence <persName>The Sultan of Zanzibar</persName> furnished a 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">frinan</unclear> to all his people whom we may meet 
<lb/>in Africa. This will at least prevent hostility, 
<lb/>&amp; may do much more. It is a gratifying 
<lb/>proof of <persName>H.H's</persName> friendship. </p>
<lb/><p>Some of the gentlemen of <persName>Bombay</persName> of their 
<lb/>own accord entered into a subscription in aid 
<lb/>of my expedition, &amp; handed Â£645 to me. I 
<lb/>have deposited this sum with a mercantile 
<lb/>firm to be used as soon as I can point out a 
<lb/>comparatively healthy locality, in an effort to 
<lb/>establish lawful commerce, &amp; begin that system 
<lb/>wh<hi rend="sup underline">h</hi> has been so emminently successful on the West 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">Coast</fw>

<lb/>Coast.  It is probable that a mercantile 
<lb/>house will manage a matter of this kind to 
<lb/>greater advantage, &amp; spend the money to 
<lb/>better purpose than I could, because I am 
<lb/>deficient in the trading instinct. </p>
<lb/><p>The explanations pointed out in <persName>Y. L's</persName>
<lb/>instructions, and in those of the Royal 
<lb/>Geographical Soc<hi rend="sup">y</hi> will claim my earliest 
<lb/>&amp; earnest attention. </p>
