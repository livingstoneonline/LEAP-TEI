<lb/><p rend="right">1861 </p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>After ascending barely 30 miles 
<lb/>we found that the water of <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> was 
<lb/>falling at the rate of about half a foot a day 
<lb/>and we saw at once that had we proceeded 
<lb/>we should be detained till next flood. Had 
<lb/>the whole of the bishop's party been with us 
<lb/>we should have had little hesitation about it - 
<lb/>but as only he &amp; <persName>Rowley</persName> were there we resolved not 
<lb/>to be caught but return here and then go to <placeName>Shire</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Had we taken them there first we see now that all 
<lb/>would have perished - fever is unusually severe 
<lb/>this year probably from the amount of rain 
<lb/>being greater than ever known. While on the 
<lb/>Fever I may say at once all have had it with 
<lb/>one or two exceptions and all have recovered<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It was all we could do to make <placeName>Mohilla</placeName> - there 
<lb/>we bought very indifferent wood - then we bought 
<lb/>a ton <add place="above">of coals</add> here to take us round the island to H M. 
<lb/>Wasp. where we got 26 tons - we got also a 
<lb/>rain awning of which we stood very greatly 
<lb/>in need for our "sun awning" allowed any 
<lb/>one under it to be drenched. Having a great 
<lb/>many things in the cabin, as we have no 
<lb/>hold, most sleep on deck - the rain awning 
<lb/>will be a great protection &amp; comfort. I 
<lb/>treated all the men who had been sick with 
<lb/>fresh meat &amp; vegetables as often as we could 
<lb/>get them. I engaged six Johanna men 
<lb/><add place="above">some of</add>  whom have been on board whalers at £1 
<lb/>8/8 a month or as they say seven dollars 
<lb/>I advanced 2 months pay to each - they are 
<lb/>easily rationed and should there be pleased<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001656_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>After 12 months service we shall get as 
<lb/>many as we please. I had just taken our 
<lb/>Makololo crew home to their own land when 
<lb/>Pioneer arrived, and sixteen who are now 
<lb/>with us are perfectly raw &amp; useless on the 
<lb/>sea. For land they are invaluable - they 
<lb/>brought the half caste Arabs on the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>to their senses in no time by only making a 
<lb/>rush to their arms when they began the 
<lb/>insolence of which <persName>Burton</persName> so much 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>plains</w> - but on the sea they are like children, 
<lb/>and I have to treat them with the greatest 
<lb/>gentleness. We discharged five men into 
<lb/>the Wasp on <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> the Johannese. 
<lb/>One Quarter master is quite useless from 
<lb/>old Rheumatism - and a leading stoker 
<lb/>a most willing man, from chronic dysentery 
<lb/>of old standing - the others were quite well. 
<lb/>We shall reduce the whites as soon as we 
<lb/>can. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he stokers for instance, but they are 
<lb/>necessary for this sea voyage. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName>
<lb/>goes home by way of the <placeName>Cape</placeName>. He has 
<lb/>suffered somewhat from fever, and his 
<lb/>remaining would have broken up the previous 
<lb/>arrangements of the Foreign Office, and 
<lb/>possibly caused disturbance, so I proposed 
<lb/>to him to retire in an amicable way. As 
<lb/>you had wisely forwarned him might be 
<lb/>necessary, I giving him a letter thanking 
<lb/>him for his services in bringing out 
<lb/>the Pioneer. <del type="strikethrough"><gap extent="5" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/>
<lb/><gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/></del>, I have avoided saying a word 
<lb/>about his retirement to any one - except 
<lb/>to the Foreign Office, and hope no 
<lb/>unfavourable inference may be drawn from his retiring<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>Returning to the subject of expenses, 
<lb/>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> £17 <add place="above">from <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName></add> the balance of money 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> by him at the <placeName>Cape</placeName>. The Bishop had 
<lb/>advanced £10 to a <add place="above">black</add> man intended to act as 
<lb/><unclear cert="low"><persName>M's</persName></unclear> interpreter. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his man was to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice>
<lb/>£36 per annum &amp; £2 per month was to 
<lb/>be advanced to his wife out of it. As we 
<lb/>could not well break through the arrangement 
<lb/>though he is useless as an interpreter we 
<lb/>have made him cook. <addSpan spanTo="#p.1v-02" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left hand margin'--></addSpan> We found that he had been a slave and would have made mischief so send him off to the Cape. His wife and he will cost us not £17 but £22. <anchor xml:id="p.1v-02"/> <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he balance of £17 
<lb/>was therefore only nominal. Our 
<lb/>expenses for fresh meat &amp; vegetables, which 
<lb/>for the sake of those <del type="strikethrough"> I got from </del>
<lb/>who had had fever I got as frequently as possible; 
<lb/>for fowls - wood at <placeName>Mohilla</placeName> - boat hire 
<lb/>one ton of coals to take us round from 
<lb/><placeName>Pomony bay</placeName> to the Wasp - provisions 
<lb/>for the natives on board, and advance 
<lb/>of two months<reg>'</reg> wages to each, amounted 
<lb/>to nearly £50. So I gave a <choice><sic>receipt</sic><corr>receipt</corr></choice> for 
<lb/>that amount on the 18<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> April to the 
<lb/>Paymaster. <add place="above">H.M S Wasp</add>. We got also stronger tackling 
<lb/>that used to take the ship off a bank in 
<lb/><placeName>Rovuma</placeName> having broke several times. Also 
<lb/>an addition to the white crew's provisions<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We shall not come down the river till 
<lb/>1<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> January 1862. We ought then to 
<lb/>have a stock of fresh provisions ready 
<lb/>at the mouth of <placeName>Kongone</placeName>. Preserved 
<lb/>meats are the most important article 
<lb/>for us, those on board Pioneer when 
<lb/>she came were to last till September<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001656_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>In consequence of having the bishop &amp; <persName>Rowley</persName>
<lb/><persName>Kirk</persName>, <persName>Livingstone</persName> &amp; myself addition <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName>
<lb/>will tell you there is not much likelihood of 
<lb/><choice><sic>of</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> the stock lasting so long. We shall use as 
<lb/>much native produce as we can. We ask the 
<lb/>bishop to contribute to the cabin table from 
<lb/>this place onwards. The only thing we ask of 
<lb/>you is <hi rend="underline">Preserved fresh meats</hi>. We can get 
<lb/>coffee tea &amp; sugar from the Cape. Salt meats 
<lb/>and biscuit from the men of war. We 
<lb/>found 23 bottles of brandy in Pioneer, and 
<lb/>put them into the medical stores. Of wines 
<lb/>and spirits a good quantity was got at the 
<lb/>Cape &amp; that is the best place to send if we 
<lb/>need any more. A present of 4 dozen 
<lb/>best Export ale from <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> C. S. Hanbury</persName> turned 
<lb/>out to be only four bottles. They had forgotten 
<lb/>to wire their corks!! The idea that these were 
<lb/>safe made us use those you kindly sent 
<lb/>freely after out long tramp up to <placeName>Sesheke</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Please do not send any more cotton gins 
<lb/>till you hear from me - but honour 
<lb/>a small bill for some medicines from 
<lb/>the Apothecaries company which will be 
<lb/>sent. The new medicines got at the Cape 
<lb/>are rubbish and in some cases required 
<lb/>a shovelful of salts atop to make them 
<lb/>operate. </p>
<lb/><p>I could not square our last years 
<lb/>account because I could not get a bill 
<lb/>from <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> &amp; another from <placeName><w>Mos-<lb break="no"/>ambique</w></placeName> - but though the expenses arising 
<lb/>from our goods being pretty well all expended 
<lb/>the calicoes being very dear &amp; our means 
<lb/>of locomotion gone - the sum against Gov<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
<lb/>is not large. I have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>£130 by way 
<lb/>of the Cape Treasury </p>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001656_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
<lb/><p>If there are any means of getting 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Livingstone</persName>a passage out I think 
<lb/>I shall be able to provide a house for 
<lb/>her by January 1862. I understand 
<lb/>that Government has contracts 
<lb/>with certain lines whereby they can 
<lb/>send whom they will at a lower 
<lb/>rate of fare than the common. If 
<lb/>you can procure that or any other 
<lb/>advantage you will oblige me much 
<lb/>the bishop<reg>'</reg>s sisters are now at the 
<lb/>Cape and come up by a Man of 
<lb/>War in January next. I suppose 
<lb/>we shall have entered into little 
<lb/>contracts with as many villages 
<lb/>on our route as we touch at 
<lb/>to buy cotton and also settled the 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> questions 
<lb/>by that time and it will not do for 
<lb/>me to keep away from my wife after 
<lb/>the other ladies have come. So I give 
<lb/>her leave to come and she will 
<lb/>be sort of headquarters for us. 
<lb/>The steamer must remain up all 
<lb/>the time <add place="above">till January</add> as our point of retreat. </p>
<lb/><p>A small gun boat's condenser 
<lb/>said not to be more than 18 inches 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001656_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/>in diameter and costing only £15 or 
<lb/>£20 - would enable <del type="strikethrough">to</del> us to get rid 
<lb/>a great inconvenience - the want of a 
<lb/>hold. It is said that there are a number 
<lb/>of these little condensers always on 
<lb/>hand - they are made for the <del type="strikethrough">lowe</del>
<lb/>smallest gunboats and distil enough 
<lb/>for all we shall ever need to put aboard. 
<lb/>We could get rid of the large Tanks<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We are now obliged to put in three 
<lb/>tons of water - and though we may 
<lb/>not be in the sea often yet we 
<lb/>should condense in unhealthy water 
<lb/>such as <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> in flood which 
<lb/>gave us all diarrhoea. I mention 
<lb/>this to you only. I think all additional 
<lb/>we should require would be piping 
<lb/>and only a few feet of that. </p>
<lb/><p>We have ordered 2 mules and 
<lb/>2 Scotch carts from the Cape by 
<lb/><persName>Sir George Grey</persName> to transport our 
<lb/>goods past the Cataracts. By the 
<lb/>way our goods should have been 
<lb/>got from <persName>James Aspinal Turner</persName>
<lb/>M.P. for <placeName>Manchester</placeName><reg>.</reg> He supplied 
<lb/>us formerly and his goods gave 
<lb/>great satisfaction. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Clegg's</persName> people

<lb/>sent a lot of fragments in one bale, &amp; 
<lb/>the articles generally good for the 
<lb/>West in doubt are too flimsy for our 
<lb/>people. Of the men discharged into 
<lb/>the Wasp two were suffering 
<lb/>from the effects of former 
<lb/>Tropical diseases - but all the 
<lb/>fever cases recovered well.
