<lb/><p>Thanks for your kind little notes - the sun's places came too 
<lb/>late for this year. Remember me please kindly to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> W.</persName></p>

<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>We went up to examine 
<lb/><placeName>Kebra basa</placeName> as soon as we were all 
<lb/>safely housed in the house of 
<lb/>the Commandant, and while the 
<lb/>water in the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> was at its 
<lb/>lowest. We collected all the 
<w>in-<lb break="no"/>formation</w> we could in <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>and that was just nothing more 
<lb/>than the Portuguese writers all 
<lb/>asserted on the same sort of 
<lb/>testimony. "An obstruction to 
<lb/>navigation" "a number of rocks 
<lb/>jutting out of the water across the 
<lb/>stream" - only one man had 
<lb/>gone beyond the entrance, and we 
<lb/>steamed up 4 miles beyond and 
<lb/>found that the affair is an 
<lb/>obstruction to navigation in 
<lb/>what - canoes only. The difficulty 
<lb/>consists in the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> being 
<lb/>confined by mountains to 
<lb/>a bed about 1/4 mile broad<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>This bed which we shall call 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001387_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>the flood bed is covered with enormous 
<lb/>boulders black glazed &amp; slippery - 
<lb/><choice><sic>porphery</sic><corr>porphyry</corr></choice><!--although this can be porphery--> &amp; syenite twisted &amp; huddled 
<lb/>together in every possible way 
<lb/>form the subsoil (!) and in it 
<lb/>winding from side to side there 
<lb/>is a groove or rut 30 or 40 yards 
<lb/>wide &amp; as we sailed up the man 
<lb/>at the lead kept calling out "No 
<lb/>bottom at ten fathoms". <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he walls 
<lb/>generally perpendicular are worn 
<lb/>into potholes and rise from about 
<lb/>30 to 80 or more feet high. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here are rocky islands in it 
<lb/>which increase the force of the 
<lb/>current and as <del type="strikethrough">both</del><add place="above">neither</add> canoes &amp; 
<lb/>this feeble vessel cannot stem 
<lb/>a four knot current. It is Kaora 
<lb/>-basa, it is "cut the toil" (of paddling) 
<lb/>and they cut their <supplied cert="low" reason="omitted">way</supplied><!-- Entirely conjectural reading --> over the level 
<lb/><placeName>Shidima country</placeName> instead. The can<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>paddle against 4 knots, nor punt 
<lb/>at 60 ft. nor tow at a height 
<lb/>of 80 over jagged &amp; slippery rocks 
<lb/>hence the "obstruction to navigation"<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We did not wish to go up now so 
<lb/>when we came to a four knot 
<lb/>current we left the vessel and went 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001387_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>forward to examine on foot. We 
<lb/>found one rapid the fall in which 
<lb/>was 5 ft. but when we returned 
<lb/>the river had risen three or four 
<lb/>and the place was level. But 
<lb/>fancy the effect of a perpendicular 
<lb/>rise of clear eighty feet. We 
<lb/>measured it carefully at different 
<lb/>places and this must take place
<lb/>before the upper flood bed is 
<lb/>covered. The worst cataract of 
<lb/>all comes down at an angle 
<lb/>of 30ยบ but I stood in a pothole 
<lb/>which is annually submerged 
<lb/>30 feet and dropped down a 
<lb/>measuring tape 53 ft to the water<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>There cannot be a vestige of 
<lb/>broken water at 40 ft rise 
<lb/>and there the water stands long 
<lb/>for the black glaze reaches that 
<lb/>height. This last or the only 
<lb/>cataract worth the name is 
<lb/>called <placeName>Morumbua</placeName> and immense 
<lb/>difficulty we had in getting there 
<lb/>climbing as hard as we could 
<lb/>over stones &amp; rocks so hot we 
<lb/>could not hold the hand on them 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001387_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>for an instant we could not make 
<lb/>more than one mile in three 
<lb/>hours. <choice><reg>F</reg><orig>f</orig></choice>our <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> went with 
<lb/>us and shewed their horny soles 
<lb/>blistered &amp; the blisters broken. Our 
<lb/>strong boots wore through the soles 
<lb/>in a fortnight and that fortnight 
<lb/>made us all return lean &amp; haggard 
<lb/>as if recovering from severe 
<lb/>illness. In truth it was the hardest 
<lb/>bit of travel I ever went through &amp; 
<lb/>I feel sure that had we come this 
<lb/>way in 1856 I never should have 
<lb/><choice><sic>reach</sic><corr>reached</corr></choice><placeName>Tette</placeName>. The mountains are 
<lb/>upwards of 2000 ft and very steep 
<lb/>but the steepest bit of all is just 
<lb/>at <placeName>Marumbua</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he side walls rise 
<lb/>up from 300 to 600 perpendicularly 
<lb/>- no line could be carried past 
<lb/>but we are all of opinion that a 
<lb/>good strong steamer - capable of 
<lb/>going 12 or 14 knots would walk 
<lb/>through in flood with ease. B. did 
<lb/>us an immensity of harm by 
<lb/>rejecting the Ban - we could have taken 
<lb/>up all our luggage between 25 &amp; 30 
<lb/>tons at one trip &amp; then gone on to 
<lb/><persName>Sekeletu</persName> with all the <term type="tribe">Makalolo</term>. We 
<lb/>are now working below the rapid<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001387_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'--> 
<lb/>Have been prevented by an unusual 
<lb/>scarcity of food the consequence of 
<lb/>want of rain last year from 
<lb/>sending off branch explorations 
<lb/>but by February the young 
<lb/>corn will ripen, &amp; we may 
<lb/>go to <placeName>Manica</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName>. This 
<lb/>partly from <placeName>Tette</placeName>, is also written 
<lb/>on our way down river to 
<lb/>ascend the <placeName>Shire</placeName> which is said 
<lb/>to come from <placeName>Lake Nyanja</placeName>. 
<lb/>Next letter we hope to give you 
<lb/>some information about that 
<lb/>part<reg>.</reg><persName>Thornton</persName> reports having 
<lb/>found three seams of coal 
<lb/>near <placeName>Tette</placeName> - 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 7 ft thick, 2<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi>
<lb/>13 feet 6in, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> - 25 feet thick 
<lb/>all in fine cliff sections 
<lb/>the last was fired by lightning 
<lb/>a few years ago and burned 
<lb/>for a long time. There is 
<lb/>no lack of harmony among 
<lb/>us but I have to speak 
<lb/>cautiously now for I found 
<lb/>out that while I was truly &amp; 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001387_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/>faithfully reporting the same before 
<lb/>our naval officer was dogging my 
<lb/>steps to every one with whom I happened 
<lb/>to talk with "What was he talking about"<reg/>
<lb/>We are, thank God, favoured with 
<lb/>good health. We have had no fever 
<lb/>except among the Kroomen and 
<lb/>I would prefer Englishmen to them 
<lb/>as more safe and effective. We take 
<lb/>no quinine up at <placeName>Tette</placeName>. We slept 
<lb/>without cover during the whole 
<lb/>fortnight of exploring the rapids 
<lb/>and generally did not draw on the 
<lb/>blanket till morning. We have had 
<lb/>nothing but colds modified a 
<lb/>little by the malaria of the Delta<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>Baines</persName> had a slight sunstroke but 
<lb/>is now quite well. I send you 
<lb/>a tracing of the river above <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>by <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> a worthy good fellow 
<lb/>as ever lived. They all work at 
<lb/>anything they are desired to do 
<lb/>without hesitation<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Should the Government send us 
<lb/>out another vessel there are various 
<lb/>matters you might send us too<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I scarcely expect it this flood 
<lb/>but if in time for next January 
<lb/>our two years<reg>'</reg> supplies may 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001387_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'--> 
<lb/>be getting low. The man <persName>Evans</persName> who 
<lb/>supplied the last did very well - the 
<lb/>meal alone being badly soldered was 
<lb/>wasted on the Quay at <placeName>Liverpool</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> J. A. Turner</persName> M. P. for Manchester 
<lb/>would supply the cloth to our advantage<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We are not by any means out 
<lb/>of anything of importance now 
<lb/>but looking forward it may be 
<lb/>well to suggest some addition<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>By the way I made a mistake about 
<lb/>sugar the natives do make it 
<lb/>near to this and I bought 6 pots 
<lb/>at the rate of two yards of calico or 
<lb/>say a shilling for 20 lbs. We have 
<lb/>put up our little engine - saw 
<lb/>mill &amp; sugar mill at <placeName>Tette</placeName> to shew 
<lb/>what can be done. <persName>Major Secard</persName>
<lb/>carried them up for us - the 
<lb/>Buaze is ripe in February - the 
<lb/>seed <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> says is full of 
<lb/>oleaginous matter &amp; the Portuguese 
<lb/>say it gives good oil for painting<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Coming back to the affair of the 
<lb/>vessel - <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> with a second 
<lb/>engineer &amp; <persName>Roe</persName> the leading stoker 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001387_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>would manage the engines - one 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> makes an excellent 
<lb/>stoker. I think we have proved 
<lb/>that with due exercise &amp; other precautions 
<lb/>you need not fear for Europeans 
<lb/>when they get beyond the Delta - <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>and I have had uninterrupted good 
<lb/>health.</p>
<lb/><p>I know you will do what you 
<lb/>can to forward our plans and besides 
<lb/>aiding in the arrangements necessary<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I hope you will not allow any of our 
<lb/>matters to fall into the hands of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Laird</persName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is the shabbiest engine 
<lb/>ever turned out of shop. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Medlycott</persName>
<lb/>of the <term type="boat">Lynx</term> tried her without an ounce 
<lb/>of cargo and a brisk breeze held her 
<lb/>paddles so that we stood still. You remember 
<lb/>my protesting against the want of power 
<lb/>and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> M. Laird</persName> said "O steam is very 
<lb/>little understood". One can understand 
<lb/>a little when obliged to spend half our 
<lb/>time in wood cutting. We are now 
<lb/>less than 1/16 of an inch thick and 
<lb/>dare not tow her up the rapids - carrying 
<lb/>is an absolute impossibility. It must 
<lb/>be done over mountains which cost 
<lb/>us three hours to cut a path over for ourselves<reg>.</reg></p>
