<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Tette</placeName> 16 Feb<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 1859</p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Having visited <placeName>Kebra basa</placeName>
<lb/>twice during the period of low water I left 
<lb/>orders with <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> C. Livingstone</persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Baines</persName>
<lb/>to examine it again when the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>had risen twelve feet, and with <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>in company went up the <placeName>Shire</placeName> about 
<lb/>a hundred miles from its confluence<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is admirably adapted for steam 
<lb/>navigation being deep &amp; without sand 
<lb/>banks. The current is not quite so strong 
<lb/>as in the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> but unlike that river 
<lb/>it has no still reaches and is on that 
<lb/>account scarcely navigable by heavy canoes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The Portuguese have never ascended 
<lb/>it more that 20 or 30 from its 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>fluence</w> but say that one Governor 
<lb/>having sent an expedition to explore it 
<lb/>their progress was stopped by the great 
<lb/>masses of duck weed which blocked up 
<lb/>the river. As the duck weed disappears 
<lb/>about 25 miles up we judge of the distance 
<lb/>explored as not very great<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001402_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/><placeName>Marambala</placeName> placed on the wrong side of the 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName> in my map as <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Arrowsmith</persName> may 
<lb/>explain is 4000 ft high and would make 
<lb/>a splendid sanatorium. It is well cultivated 
<lb/>on the top - has plenty of water and a 
<lb/>vegetation exceedingly like that of <placeName>Londa</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Angola</placeName> - the climate is quite different 
<lb/>from that below but our Portuguese friends 
<lb/>have never availed themselves of it 
<lb/>nor of the hot sulphureous fountain at 
<lb/>its base (174ยบ) though skin diseases are 
<lb/>as common among them as red noses 
<lb/>among ourselves. I thought it would be 
<lb/>agreeable to the Foreign Secretary to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice>
<lb/>the impressions of another observer &amp; 
<lb/>requested <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> to write a report which 
<lb/>no doubt you will see as one of my 
<lb/>enclosures. I would only add that beyond 
<lb/>the cataract that stopped our progress up, 
<lb/>there are five days of rocky country &amp; 
<lb/>then the river is reported smooth and 
<lb/>is used by the Moors to come down 
<lb/>in canoes from <placeName>Nyanja</placeName>. The people were 
<lb/>so suspicious of us that I did not 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>sider</w> it prudent to leave the vessel and 
<lb/>go farther. We waited three days at the 
<lb/>cataract for an observation for latitude 
<lb/>in vain, and during that time had a 
<lb/><choice><sic>regiement</sic><corr>regiment</corr></choice> on each bank <choice><sic>gaurding</sic><corr>guarding</corr></choice> us. 
<lb/>We did nothing to make us ashamed

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001402_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>to go back - the people had plenty of cotton, i.e. 
<lb/>for their own use and sold their yarn 
<lb/>readily, and provisions also, but they 
<lb/>evidently expected us to attack &amp; kidnap 
<lb/>them. When we went ashore they behaved 
<lb/>civilly and our wooding parties were 
<lb/>never molested, so I think we made a 
<lb/>favourable beginning of intercourse 
<lb/>with them. They don<reg>'</reg>t need cotton seed, 
<lb/>one variety they possess is better than 
<lb/>what we have to give.</p>
<lb/><p>On returning to <placeName>Tette</placeName> we found that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. 
<lb/>L.</persName> &amp; his companion had gone to 
<lb/><placeName>Kebra basa</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey returned next day after 
<lb/><add place="above">our arrival and</add> their reports which I have enclosed 
<lb/>to the Foreign Secretary coincide with 
<lb/>what I advanced in my last dispatch. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he cataracts become obliterated in 
<lb/>flood, but a strong steamer is 
<lb/>necessary to stem the current and 
<lb/>not be drawn into the eddies. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his 
<lb/>rapid is rather favourable for 
<lb/>us than otherwise, for the Portuguese 
<lb/>will not be able to pass without 
<lb/>our assistance, and a sense of 
<lb/>helplessness may dispose them 
<lb/>to be more cordial in co-operating with 
<lb/>us. At present they have to pay 
<lb/>for leave to pass <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> they get to 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001402_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/><placeName>Zumbo</placeName>, and think themselves happy 
<lb/>if they get off by paying 20 pieces of 
<lb/><choice><sic>of </sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> cloth = 320 yards. At the time I came 
<lb/>down they could not go at all but 
<lb/>half casts go now.</p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> on learning that we had 
<lb/>resolved to work down here till we had 
<lb/>heard whither H M Government would 
<lb/>send a vessel large enough to take us &amp; 
<lb/>our luggage up, proposed that I should 
<lb/>give them my brother to lead a party 
<lb/>overland home. I agreed at once and 
<lb/>so did my brother but on second 
<lb/>thoughts they said "that their orders 
<lb/>had been to come back with me and 
<lb/>they feared leaving me here would be 
<lb/>construed into disobedience when 
<lb/>they reached <placeName>Sekeletu</placeName>." They have uniformly 
<lb/>acted from intelligent motives - I give 
<lb/>them rations at the rate of 8 fathoms of 
<lb/><choice><sic>of</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> cloth weekly or about 10/ in value. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>majority support themselves - one of them 
<lb/>is a stoker and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> says he does 
<lb/>more work than all the Kroomen together<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>At <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> R's</persName> suggestion I have raised his 
<lb/>pay to 1/6 per day. When we go anywhere 
<lb/>they accompany us as the Krooman 
<lb/>profess to be unable to travel on foot<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001402_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'--> 
<lb/>You remember an order sent out by the 
<lb/>Portuguese Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi> to support them at 
<lb/>the public expense of the Province of 
<lb/><placeName>Mosambique</placeName>. It would do no good 
<lb/>to let it be publicly known that 
<lb/>the order came with myself &amp; has 
<lb/>never been acted on. And here the 
<lb/>native game law which claims the 
<lb/>half of the elephant which lies 
<lb/>on the ground for the Lord of the soil 
<lb/>has been put into operation by 
<lb/>the authorities. The commandant 
<lb/>is our best friend and I don<reg>'</reg>t wish 
<lb/>this to be known as he would be 
<lb/>blamed. He assisted the headmen 
<lb/>very largely out of his own private 
<lb/>purse and has done everything 
<lb/>he possibly could for us. <persName>Col. 
<lb/>Nunes</persName> took nothing for Bedingfeld's 
<lb/>keep and other Portuguese have 
<lb/>behaved liberally so I don<reg>'</reg>t say 
<lb/>anything which might to be 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>strued</w> disparagingly.</p>
<lb/><p>We put up a little engine I brought 
<lb/>with us and the first work it did 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001402_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/>was to saw up plank for a boat our 
<lb/>friend <persName>Major Secard</persName> wishes to build. We can 
<lb/>drive a corn and small sugar mill 
<lb/>and mean to use them both for our 
<lb/>own use (meal) and to shew the 
<lb/>people here what can be done with 
<lb/>their cane. I was mistaken in saying 
<lb/>the natives don<reg>'</reg>t make sugar. Here 
<lb/>they do and we buy it very cheap for 
<lb/>the Kroomen. We have  a turning lathe 
<lb/>and blast - but these were all intended &amp; 
<lb/>I hope will be used among the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>By the way we have three boxes of 
<lb/>machinery of which I know nothing 
<lb/>what I ordered I know they are 
<lb/>all small and compact but these are 
<lb/>large. I hope no one has come with 
<lb/>a bill after I left. When the river 
<lb/>rose I felt strongly inclined to drag 
<lb/>this half canoe half steamer &amp; whole 
<lb/>abortion of a vessel through but 
<lb/>when we should succeed as she 
<lb/>can carry no cargo we would 
<lb/>very soon be destitute. And there 
<lb/>is Manica which I have a 
<lb/>very strong desire to examine. We 
<lb/>were going to <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001402_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'--> 
<lb/>but the Portuguese dissuaded us from 
<lb/>the attempt now - the grass is now 
<lb/>so tall as to wet one with the dew 
<lb/>and obstructs the vision. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is 
<lb/>too our most unhealthy season<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Here we have had slight touches 
<lb/>of fever <persName>Baines</persName><reg>,</reg><persName>Thornton</persName> &amp; <persName>C. Livingstone</persName><reg>,</reg>
<lb/><persName>Kirk</persName> and I have enjoyed uninterrupted 
<lb/>good health ever since we 
<lb/>came. We took quinine in the 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName>. The Quarter master and 
<lb/>Stoker are well and doing well. 
<lb/>The latter <persName>William Rowe</persName> not Roe 
<lb/>as I spelled it has been in the 
<lb/>habit of giving his wife a portion 
<lb/>of his wages and I have presumed 
<lb/>on your kindness to see it 
<lb/>continued. This was mentioned in 
<lb/>my last dispatch - Her present address 
<lb/>is <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Rowe</persName> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 79 Mount St 
<lb/>Devonport, Devon. By a mistake 
<lb/>he was marked <hi rend="underline">Discharged</hi>, now 
<lb/>he is not discharged but <hi rend="underline">lent</hi>
<lb/>and as he has 18 years<reg>'</reg> service 
<lb/>I shall write the Admiral to change 
<lb/>the word. He very promptly saved 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001402_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>the lives of several natives whose canoe 
<lb/>was overturned and shewed an example 
<lb/>worthy of imitation to the Portuguese - only 
<lb/>yesterday morning a woman was taken 
<lb/>off by an alligator and the brute came 
<lb/>past the vessel with her in its mouth<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Great numbers are taken off annually 
<lb/>by them yet when I offered a subscription 
<lb/>of ยฃ2 to build a fence as we saw done 
<lb/>in the <placeName>Shire</placeName> the priest at <placeName>Senna</placeName> would 
<lb/>not bring the project forward.</p>
<lb/><p>We came back from the <placeName>Shire</placeName> on the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
<lb/>currt. I think it proper to remain during 
<lb/>this month under shelter on account 
<lb/>of the unhealthiness of this season. At 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimane</placeName> this is the fatal period 
<lb/>here there is illness but no deaths. 
<lb/>I wish I knew what <persName>Burton</persName> has 
<lb/>done at <placeName>Nyanja</placeName>. We have had no 
<lb/>mail since we left England except 
<lb/>a few letters in Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> last from 
<lb/>the <placeName>Cape</placeName> and a note from yourself. 
<lb/>The sun<reg>'</reg>s bearings will come in nicely 
<lb/>now, and if well you may expect 
<lb/>to hear that we have done something 
<lb/>either up <placeName>Shire</placeName> or in <placeName>Manica</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Gorongozo</placeName>. Please remember me 
<lb/>kindly to your Lady &amp; family. I hear nothing of mine<reg>.</reg></p>
