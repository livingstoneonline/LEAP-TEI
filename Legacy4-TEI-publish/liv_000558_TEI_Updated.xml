<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Mabotsa</placeName> 11<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> May 1844</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Brother</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I received your most welcome letter and present 
<lb/>in January last. We were then busy in packing up in order to leave <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>
<lb/>and as every step of our subsequent progress took us farther &amp; farther 
<lb/>from the Post Office I have been unable to acknowledge your kindness 
<lb/>as promptly as I should otherwise have done. The book for which I 
<lb/>heartily thank you, could not have come by any more speedy conveyance 
<lb/>But had you posted the letter I should have been cheered by its arrival 
<lb/>at least six months sooner. Please transmit your letters always 
<lb/>by post for although Scotch I dont think I shall ever grudge to pay 
<lb/>even though those from you should cost three times as much as they 
<lb/>do from any one else. My heart warms every time I call to rememberance 
<lb/>my old fellow students and I am always quite delighted when I hear 
<lb/>from them By the bye, what has become of that man <persName>Fairbrother</persName>? 
<lb/>He is the only one of all our squad at <placeName>Ongar</placeName> whom I have lost sight 
<lb/>of. I heard a long time ago that he was then at college. But he cant 
<lb/>be there now unless he is trying to become an <unclear cert="high"><!--<app><rdg>--><choice><abbr>S.T.P.</abbr><expan>Sacrosanctae Theologiae Professor (Professor of Sacred Theology)</expan></choice><!--</rdg><rdg>S.J.J.</rdg></app>--></unclear> or <choice><abbr>D.D.</abbr><expan>Doctor of Divinity</expan></choice> - <!-- long dash--></p>
<lb/><p>I feel thankful for the trouble you were so kind as to put yourself to 
<lb/>respecting the question of Polygamy. I am not however so happy 
<lb/>as to feel convinced that your views of the subject are correct But the 
<lb/>fact you mention of so many men of ability having supported these 
<lb/>views will have the effect of inducing me to follow the same line of 
<lb/>conduct I have hitherto done viz, with respect to that subject follow 
<lb/>in the <unclear cert="low"><app><rdg>track</rdg><rdg>tract</rdg></app></unclear> of my predecessors, I still have doubts and a variety of 
<lb/>considerations which you dont touch at all tend to keep me in suspense. 
<lb/>I am not aware that Christianity gives any licence for asaulting the  
<lb/>civil institutions of man, (slavery?) and it is expressly stated that a 
<lb/>man may not put away his wife for any cause except one But 
<lb/>the polygamist does not seem to have this cause for putting away his 
<lb/>inferior wives. We cannot call it adultery when we think of <persName>Hagar</persName>
<lb/>being sent back by the Divine command into that state But I cannot 
<lb/>say that I am right in this &amp; when I think on the subject I always feel 
<lb/>perplexed, the same sort of reasoning makes me reject your remarks

<lb/>&amp;c as he seems to have done with regard to polygamy &amp; this I <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice>
<lb/>precludes it from being called a parallel case But this is not to be 
<lb/>a controversial correspondence so I drop the subject.</p>
<lb/><p>We came her in <choice><abbr>Feb<hi rend="sup">y</hi></abbr><expan>February</expan></choice> last and have fairly made a commencement 
<lb/>among the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>. Our cottage is built about 30 miles North West of 
<lb/>what is called <placeName>the Kurechane</placeName>. We are in a delightful part of the country 
<lb/><persName>Mr Moffat's</persName> description of the region to the East of us answers in 
<lb/>almost every respect to our locality. We have fine scenery, the vege-î€€
               <!-- hyphen on line below-->tation luxuriant - the mountains covered with trees (many of them 
<lb/>evergreens) to their very summits and abundance of excellent water 
<lb/>But when we think of its moral aspect it is as yet a land of 
<lb/>darkness - a <unclear cert="medium">vast</unclear> howling wilderness which has never yielded any 
<lb/>of those fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the glory 
<lb/>of God the Father. The people however are kind and agreeable in 
<lb/>their manners towards; We have to endure none of those vexations 
<lb/>which the earlier missionaries suffered; there is no stealing 
<lb/>and comparatively little impudence and pride. But we dont know 
<lb/>how long this state of matters may continue, the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> from 
<lb/>being the most abject can be when they like the most insolent 
<lb/>provoking fellows in existence, and there is no overcoming them 
<lb/>when they are so but by meekness &amp; patience, these virtues seem 
<lb/>to have been possessed in an eminent degree by the elder bretheren 
<lb/><persName>Hamilton</persName> &amp; <persName>Moffat</persName>. I can conceive what they had to endure 
<lb/>better than you and I hope my forbearance will never be put 
<lb/>to the test as theirs has been. You have read <term type="reference">Moffat's work</term> of 
<lb/>course, I think you must have liked it. It is peculiarly interesting 
<lb/>to us who know many of the places &amp; persons described. 
<lb/>When I read of the manner in which you were honouring its author 
<lb/>at home I thought these good people will spoil him But I was 
<lb/>most happy to find he was not in the least elated, assumed no 
<lb/>superiority over the rest of us who are much his inferiors and 
<lb/>appeared eminent by his humility &amp; devotedness to the cause of Jesus

<lb/>I got badly hurt by a lion since I came here but by the kindness 
<lb/>of God I am nearly well again. These animals are very trouble
<lb/>some to us at times But should the Lord crown our labours 
<lb/>to the subversion of the kingdom of him who goeth about as one, it 
<lb/>would recompense us for all our troubles. May the Lord grant 
<lb/>the accomplishment of His gracious in our experience - 
<lb/>I have no news respecting the progress of the cause in the <placeName>Lattakoo 
<lb/>district</placeName>, as no letters have been <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> since we came here. 
<lb/>The church there had for some time been in a dead sort of state 
<lb/>owing to the commotions which then distracted the attention of the 
<lb/>inhabitants. We hope however the blessing will again be poured 
<lb/>out &amp; men <add place="above">be</add> prevailed on to think as the whole country is now 
<lb/>quite quiet. Rumours of wars have a very different effect 
<lb/>here <add place="above">from</add><!--'that' changed to 'what'??-->what they have in the newspapers at home. War here 
<lb/>affects all for no one knows where it will end and thus 
<lb/>the native mind becomes distracted with anxiety. It is also 
<lb/>a great hindrance to the progress of the Gospel.</p>
<lb/><p>You must be a very learned man by this time. I am sure 
<lb/>if I met you at the Cape on your way to India I should <del type="strikethrough">know</del>
<lb/><choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> a great difference. Your sentences seem to march out 
<lb/>rank &amp; file with so much ease they make me ashamed of 
<lb/>mine which are so straggling. Dont forget then when you can 
<lb/>do it with so much ease, to send a fragment now &amp; then to a 
<lb/>certain dweller in the wilderness. - I shall be glad to hear that you 
<lb/>are sent to China. I don't regret having been sent here but if I had 
<lb/>not been connected with the Society I should in all probability been 
<lb/>there before now. May you have grace to be faithful unto 
<lb/>death in the great work in which we are permitted to engage. 
<lb/>Let us remember each other at the throne of grace</p>
