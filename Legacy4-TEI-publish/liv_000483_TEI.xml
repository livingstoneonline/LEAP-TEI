<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear <persName>Watt</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Your most welcome <bibl>epistle</bibl> I received at <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName> &amp; though of necessity 
<lb/>a short one it proved quite a reviving draught in this thirsty land &amp; this not so 
<lb/>much by what it contained as by the flood of pleasing recollections it made 
<lb/>whirl through my mind. I intended writing you from <placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> &amp; I assure you 
<lb/>nothing prevented me fulfilling that intention but a strange fatuity which 
<lb/>seized me there &amp; made me really believe I should meet you there, We 
<lb/>were a long time on the passage in consequence of having been obliged to put into 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Rio De Janiero</settlement></placeName> &amp; after coming to <placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> we had to wait a month for 
<lb/>our vessel unloading at <placeName><geogName type="bay"><choice><sic>Limon's</sic><corr>Limon</corr></choice> Bay</geogName></placeName>. I did not regret going into <placeName><settlement type="city"><choice><abbr>Rio</abbr><expan>Rio De Janiero</expan></choice></settlement></placeName>
<lb/>It is certainly the finest place I ever saw. Everything delighted me except 
<lb/>man. Even the "church Establishment" there is beautiful. They really do 
<lb/>the things in style there. If even I form an Establishment it <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be either 
<lb/>of the poor degenerate "sisters" at home but the good mother herself in <placeName><country>Brazil</country></placeName>
<lb/><unclear cert="high">But</unclear> I must be very concise or I <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be able to give you even the heads of <unclear cert="high">the</unclear>
<lb/>discourse I have so much to say <add place="above">to</add><add place="below">^</add> you. [I secured a series of letters "on the status

<lb/>are tolerated. He can however do a little in the way of rooting out ignorance 
<lb/><bibl>Tracts</bibl> &amp; <bibl>bibles</bibl> are circulated &amp; some efforts might be expected were a most 
<lb/>injurious influence not exercised by <orgName>European</orgName> visitors. These alone disgrace 
<lb/>the members of the religion they profess by drunkeness. All other vices are common 
<lb/>in <placeName><settlement type="city"><choice><abbr>Rio</abbr><expan>Rio De Janiero</expan></choice></settlement></placeName>. When will the beams of divine light dispel the darkness of the beautiful 
<lb/>Empire? The climate is delightful, I wonder if disabled <term type="nationality">Indian</term> <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> 
<lb/>could not make themselves useful there]?</p>
<lb/><p>We left <placeName><geogName type="bay">Algoa Bay</geogName></placeName> on the <date when="1841-05-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> may</date> &amp; still we are <measure>a month</measure> from <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>We crossed the <placeName><geogName type="river">Orange</geogName></placeName> 10 days ago at a rather difficult ford near <placeName><settlement type="village"><unclear cert="low">hillappoba</unclear></settlement></placeName><!-- unable to determine exact place, ks -->
<lb/>in navigating my ponderous vehicle through the stream I got aground &amp; 
<lb/>my <term type="animal">oxen</term> got "reel ral" some with their heads where their tails should be 
<lb/>&amp; others with their heads twisted round in the yoke so far they appeared bent 
<lb/>on committing suicide or overturning the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>.  In this predicament 
<lb/>I was glad to see an acquaintance of yours approaching from the other 
<lb/>bank to my assistance. It was no other than "<persName>Sedras</persName>" who fortunately 
<lb/>came to the ford on his way to <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName> to buy goods with Â£10 he has 
<lb/>scraped together somehow. He is a smart fellow &amp; decidedly the best 
<lb/>spearman of <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> I have seen - I like travelling very much indeed 
<lb/>there is so much freedom connected with our <orgName>African</orgName> manners. We pitch our 
<lb/>tent, make our fire &amp;c, wherever we choose, walk, ride or shoot at abundance 
<lb/>of all sorts of game as our inclination leads us. but there is a great drawback 
<lb/><gap extent="2" unit="chars" agent="blotting"/><supplied cert="high">we</supplied><choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> study or read when we please, I feel this very much. I have 
<lb/>made but very little progress in the language - (can speak a little dutch) 
<lb/>but I long for the time when I shall give my undivided attention to it &amp; thus 
<lb/>be furnished with the means of making known the truth of the gospel</p>
<lb/><p>I was introduced by <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phillip</persName> to the <term type="occupation">Colonial <choice><abbr>Sec<hi rend="sup">y</hi></abbr><expan>Secretary</expan></choice></term> &amp; the "cases" were promptly ordered 
<lb/>I found three of them but most unfortunately an error in packing has caused the 
<lb/>destruction of many of the glass vessels. I hope however to have as many as make 
<lb/>one complete &amp; if so I may say from what I have seen of the animals of this country 
<lb/>it would be difficult to make it of some value to <persName>Mr Owen</persName> - I saw many 
<lb/>specimens of agatized wood in the bed of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Orange</geogName></placeName>, the concentric rings beautifully 
<lb/>distinct &amp; the pith chrystalized regularly &amp; as clear as crystal. but the edges of the 
<lb/>chrystals were mostly rubbed off by friction amongst other stones - In a plane about 
<lb/><measure>50 miles</measure> from the river I passed an entire tree completely agatized &amp; retaining so 
<lb/>much of the original appearance I took it at first for real wood - It was 
<lb/>broken into blocks of about a foot &amp; a half in length. I took <choice><sic>peices</sic><corr>pieces</corr></choice> of it but I 
<lb/>must not begin to describe all or any of the wonders I have seen. Any book 
<lb/>of travels will supply with wonders ad infinitum?</p>
<lb/><p>The missions on this side <supplied cert="high">of</supplied> the river are in a sad state. Every man's hand 
<lb/>is against his neighbour.  Whatever may have been the original cause of 
<lb/>dispute the present state of feeling amongst our <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> is most disgraceful 
<lb/><persName>Mr Moffat</persName> is not on speaking terms with the <placeName><settlement type="town">Guqua</settlement></placeName> town <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> &amp; 
<lb/>takes another route when visiting the Colony<!-- Cape Town Colony? MB --> to avoid seeing them.  They <unclear cert="medium">in their</unclear><!-- the preceeding may be two words or one, I am highly unsure, ks, 7.7.12 --><!-- changed from "in then" to "in their." MB-->
<lb/>turn <hi rend="underline">hate</hi> the <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> in the Colony<!-- Cape Town Colony? MB --> &amp; amongst the whole there exists a pretty 
<lb/>respectable amount of floating scandal one against the other. All uniting on 
<lb/>this side to scandalize <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phillip</persName>. All on the other side generally favourable to 
<lb/>the <choice><sic>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi></sic><expan>Doctor Phillip</expan></choice> &amp; unfavourable to those on this side. The Devil is in it but they <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> see 
<lb/>him or rather <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice>. I am determined to stand aloof from both parties but

<lb/><p>down as a <orgName>Phillipite</orgName> myself &amp; looked upon with suspicion by all the anti <!-- Those against Dr. Phillip. MB -->
<lb/>I confess I feel very differently on the subject of the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s superintendance now 
<lb/>but you must not imagine I am in the least changed in my senses 
<lb/>respecting thorough going independancy, the burden of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>Moffat</persName>'s    
<lb/>soup to me was always derogatory to the character of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Phillip</expan></choice></persName>. This filled in 
<lb/>with prejudice against the latter. A month's residence in their house during 
<lb/>which time I had sufficient opportunities of scrutinizing their characters, has 
<lb/>completely dissolved the whole of it.  With respect to his superintendance, he 
<lb/>told me he never had considered himself as anything more than the money 
<lb/>agent of the <orgName>Society</orgName>. With spiritual affairs or modes of operation he had <!--orgName: London Missioanry Society. MB-->
<lb/>nothing to do &amp; never wished to interfere in these matters but he had been 
<lb/>frequently compelled by the <orgName>Society</orgName> referring disputes to his decision to act a part <!--orgName: London Missioanry Society. MB-->
<lb/>he had no intention to, for generally one party was dissatisfied &amp; he came 
<lb/>his calumniator.  He may have domineered in some instances but <persName>Mr 
<lb/><choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> is I understand not the man who would cast the first stone- The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is now 
<lb/>in his dotage &amp; <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> do any more harm but were he in his vigour I should 
<lb/>greatly prefer the despotism of <hi rend="underline">one</hi> to that of the many. The later <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> seems 
<lb/>bent on establishing &amp; my poor neighbour here seems delighted with the idea 
<lb/>of having a "<hi rend="underline"><orgName>Presbytery</orgName></hi>" I hope <persName>Griffith</persName> is a staunch <orgName><choice><sic>Independant</sic><corr>Independent</corr></choice></orgName>, you see the 
<lb/>part I must act. The present system is real liberty compared <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">with</add> committeeocracy 
<lb/>I feel I am giving you a very partial view of the subject It would take a day<supplied cert="high">'</supplied>s talk 
<lb/>to explain the whole subject. I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> fully explain the Colonial feeling. It is 
<lb/>some what like caste in <placeName><country>India</country></placeName>. <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phillip</persName> has been the staunch advocate of the 
<lb/><orgName>coloured</orgName> population. There is a strong feeling amongst the <orgName>Colonists</orgName> against <del type="cancelled">the</del>
<lb/>him &amp; them &amp; strange to say most of the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> enemies have imbibed it. I mean 
<lb/>of the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>. I <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> say all but all I have seen certainly have- They 
<lb/>divide into radicals &amp; conservatives. They have not these names but it is of 
<lb/>that nature.  <hi rend="underline">You</hi> would be a friend of the natives you would plead their cause 
<lb/>against the <orgName><choice><orig><sic>boors</sic></orig><corr>Boors</corr><reg>Boers</reg></choice></orgName>, I know you would for I know your feelings on that 
<lb/>subject and from this I conclude you would take sides with the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; his friends 
<lb/>I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> help feeling friendly to him when I think of all he has done in the cause 
<lb/>of liberty &amp; when he tells me distinctly that he will not interfere at all in my 
<lb/>operations, that he wishes all the <term type="occupation"><choice><abbr>miss<hi rend="sup">s</hi></abbr><expan>missionaries</expan></choice></term> to follow their own plans for these 
<lb/>are generally the most efficient that they <add place="above">as</add><add place="below">^</add> individuals can employ - [every one 
<lb/>has a way of doing things &amp; each can do more in his own way than he can by 
<lb/>adopting the plans or modes of operation of another that he is only my money 
<lb/>agent, the person who pays my salary on demand Why should I wish a 
<lb/>change of affairs on the ground of the quarrels of another man? Whether it 
<lb/>has been from the spirit of opposition that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> has imbibed the Coloni<supplied cert="high">al</supplied>
<lb/>feeling I know not but certainly he had a good quantity of it while here &amp; 
<lb/>of course was a favorite with the <orgName><choice><orig><sic>boors</sic></orig><corr>Boors</corr><reg>Boers</reg></choice></orgName> But he found no Colonial feelin<supplied cert="high">g</supplied>
<lb/>in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. He spoke out just in the same strain that <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Phillip</expan></choice></persName> always has done 
<lb/>his speeches are full of affection to the <orgName>African</orgName> &amp; it appears he says <w>som<supplied cert="high">e-</supplied><lb break="no"/>thing</w> about the <orgName><choice><orig><sic>boors</sic></orig><corr>Boors</corr><reg>Boers</reg></choice></orgName> in connection with the <orgName>African</orgName>. The speeches most 
<lb/>unfortunately have found their way to this country &amp; have given morta<supplied cert="high">l</supplied>
<lb/>offence to the <orgName>Colonists</orgName>- They see he is a turncoat &amp; are greatly enraged 
<lb/>with him- <bibl>The Ghram's Town Journal</bibl>. (conducted by the <term type="faith">Wesleyans</term>) another 
<lb/>"<term type="occupation">Watchman</term>" has made known his inconsistency with joy. Altogether I sho<supplied cert="high">uld</supplied>
<lb/>not like to be in <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName>s place when he returns. Instead of being the pet of 
<lb/>the <unclear cert="high">illiberals</unclear> on account of his opposition to the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. He will now be received 
<lb/>with suspicion by both parties.  There was a great deal of sound sense &amp;
<lb/>discrimination in your friend <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName>'s sentiments respecting <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Phillip</expan></choice></persName>. 
<lb/>I am sorry I ever said anything against him. I do not avow myself a 
<lb/>friend or partizan of either but I certainly feel attached to the principles of the 
<lb/>liberal rather than of the illiberal party This is rather a <unclear cert="medium">railled</unclear> story but I dare say y<supplied cert="high">ou</supplied>
<lb/>will make out my meaning. The people in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> have no idea of these 
<lb/>matters &amp; it is very difficult to give the full idea in few words to one 
<lb/>not actually on the spot?</p>
<lb/><p>I find that the fresh water lake about which <term type="tribe">Mokoters</term> told us is a pon<supplied cert="medium">d</supplied>
<lb/>about which there is an anxiety amongst all the <orgName><choice><abbr>Miss<hi rend="sup">s</hi></abbr><expan>Missionaries</expan></choice></orgName> to do something. <w>Every<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>one</w> would like to be the first to see it for it is quite certain that one does

<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> have it in contemplation soon to take a trip thither.  One 
<lb/>of them rather an enterprising character was <unclear cert="low">shrited</unclear> to become a corresponding

<lb/><p>His brother in law sounded me as to my intentions but got nothing out - <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>
<lb/>has got Â£400 from some <choice><abbr>gent.</abbr><expan>gentleman</expan></choice> in <placeName><choice><abbr>Eng.</abbr><expan><country>England</country></expan></choice></placeName> for the purpose of fitting out our expedition to it 
<lb/>This I heard incidentally.  <persName>Ross</persName> blabbed it out in my presence to one of <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName>'s chief

<lb/><term type="occupation"><choice><abbr>Miss.<hi rend="sup">s</hi></abbr><expan>Missionaries</expan></choice></term> who will be sure to lose no time in setting out. If they give your humble 
<lb/>servant a month or two to acquire the colloquial language they may spare 
<lb/>themselves the pains of being first "in at the death". I can acquire the language while 
<lb/>travelling, without this ponderous vehicle, as well as by remaining at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>perhaps better for I shall live as they do &amp; mix constantly with them &amp; I can

<lb/>having never studied it &amp; my poor friend <persName>R.</persName> has such a precious idea of his 
<lb/>extensive learning that I have not heart to ask him. I daresay I would 
<lb/>after all stoop from my pride were I not fully concerned by all I have seen of 
<lb/>him that he knows very little about that or anything else.  He &amp; I are not
