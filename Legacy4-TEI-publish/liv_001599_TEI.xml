During the intermissions the patient is generally quite free from fever, but a degree of langour and inaptitude to exertion frequently remain.

<lb/><p>In 1850 I adopted the plan of giving quinine mixed with a 
<lb/>purgative as the first step of the treatment, and was successful 
<lb/>in the cases of two of my own children and an English party 
<lb/>whom we found at Lake Ngami, and of whom one had died 
<lb/>before our arrival. I have lost the notes of my reasons for 
<lb/>adopting the practice, but I have been successful in every case 
<lb/>I have met with since. The prescription employed is --Resin 
<lb/>of <term>jalap<!--<note type="editorial">Convolvulus jalapa is "a native of South America ... the active principle appears to be the resin and extractive matter...The root powdered is a very common, efficatious, and safe purgative, as daily experience evidences; but, according as it contains more or less resin, its effects must of course vary.

<lb/>the operation of the medicine there is an enormous discharge
<lb/>of black bile, -- the patient frequently calls it blood. If the 
<lb/>operation is delayed, a dessert-spoonful of salts promotes the 
<lb/>action. Quinine is then given till the ears ring, etc. We have

<w>con-<lb break="no"/>viction</w> that aught else is mere trifling. No strength is lost in 
<lb/>our march up the river of six hundred miles on foot. A 
<lb/>European would be stricken down one day, and the next, after 
<lb/>the operation of the remedy, would resume his march on foot. 
<lb/>In some very severe attacks it was necessary for the patient to 
<lb/>travel upon a donkey, but after two or three days he would 
<lb/>prefer to tramp it.</p>

<lb/><p>We tried <term>Warburg's tincture<!--<note type="editorial">"A preparation containing quinine and many other ingredients, often used in the treatment of malarial affections. It was invented by Dr. Warburg of London"</note>--></term>, which has a great reputation 
<lb/>in India, but it causes profuse sweating, and does not cure the 
<lb/>disease; the strength is also impaired. We had a good supply, 
<lb/>by the kindness of one of our nobility, but I am compelled to 
<lb/>say that it did not answer our expectations. The daily use of 
<lb/>quinine is no preventive. We have seen many cases occur 
<lb/>when the person was on the verge of cinchonism.</p>
<lb/><p>I employed the foregoing remedy with success on the west 
<lb/>coast, but made no fuss about it more than make a general 
<lb/>statement in the "Missionary Travels." I was not quite sure 
<lb/>that our fever was identical with that Dr. <term>M'William<!--<note type="editorial">James Ormiston McWilliam (1808-1862), Naval surgeon. Received his medical degree in 1840 and was appointed senior surgeon on the Albert, one of three ships on the Niger Expedition in 1841, the report of which was published in 1843.

<w>mis-<lb break="no"/>sionaries</w> at Linyanti, where six out of nine Europeans and 
<lb/>four native attendants perished in the space of three months, 
<lb/>makes me fear that it is the same complaint as that which 
<lb/>destroyed the officers of Commodore Owen in the Zambesi, 
<lb/>those of Captain Tuckey in the Congo, and the crews of the 
<lb/>Great Niger Expedition in that river. My companions, Dr. 
<lb/>Kirk and Mr. C. Livingstone, entertain the same opinion of the 
<lb/>value of our pills as I do. We wrote a <term>paper for one of the 
<lb/>medical journals<!--<note type="editorial">David Livingstone and John Kirk, "Remarks on the African fever on the Lower Zambesi", &lt;i&gt;Medical Times and Gazette&lt;/i&gt; N.S., v. 19, no. 489 (1859, Nov. 12, 473-474)</note>--></term>. But the above sad case makes us anxious 
<lb/>that the remedy should become more extensively known than 
<lb/>it has been, and I do not know a better plan for effecting this 
<lb/>than by communicating it to Dr. <term>M'William<!--<note type="editorial">James Ormiston McWilliam (1808-1862), Naval surgeon. Received his medical degree in 1840 and was appointed senior surgeon on the Albert, one of three ships on the Niger Expedition in 1841, the report of which was published in 1843. He was active in the formation of the Epidemiological Society and became its secretary.</note>--></term>.</p>
<lb/><p>Those who may try the remedy will do well to remember 
<lb/>that the above does are for strong adults.</p>
<lb/><p>I cured myself and native companions in this way during 
<lb/>my long journeys between 1852 and 1856, and that the 
<lb/>remedy has no bad effect on the system may be inferred from 
<lb/>the fact that I have had no regular attack of fever since my 
<lb/>return. I have had little illness, probably from exposure to 
<lb/><term>malaria</term> in its most intense forms, but nothing like what I 
<w>for-<lb break="no"/>merly</w> experienced; and I am of opinion that, what we were 
<lb/>all taught, not to give quinine till we had used the preliminary 
<lb/>measure of relieving the bowels was a mistake.</p>
<lb/><p>Query--Might not the remedy be applied to some of the 
<lb/>fevers at home that arise in unhealthy localities? Around 
<lb/>every village in this country there is a very large collection of 
<lb/>human ordure during the dry season; this is swept into the 
<lb/>rivers by the heavy rains, and you may guess the effect from 
<lb/>hundred of thousands of villages. The natives here do not 
<lb/>drink it, as the natives do on the banks of the Thames, but 
<lb/>make holes in the sand to draw from. Possibly this has as 
<lb/>much to do with the origin of fever as it has at home.</p>

<lb/>had not been in any of the rivers on the east coast; but he had 
<lb/>treated fever off the coast of Mozambique, and at Madagascar, 
<lb/>which he found of a much more tractable nature than that 
<lb/>which he had encountered on the west coast, more especially 
<lb/>in the Niger. But from what he had learned of the traders at 
<lb/>Mozambique, he feared that the rivers on the east coast were 
<lb/>not much less inimical to European life than those of the west 
<lb/>coast. The Zambesi was about twenty-five degrees south of 
<lb/>the Niger; but there seemed to be no defect of heat-- that 
<lb/>important element in the causation of fever--in the Zambesi, 
<lb/>according to the day's meteorological observations which Dr. 
<lb/>Livingstone had appended to his paper. The difference 
<lb/>between the temperature of the dry and wet bulb thermometers 
<lb/>was far beyond anything met with in the Niger, and was 
<lb/>indicative of the unwonted dryness of the atmosphere in the 
<lb/>Zambesi. With regard to the treatment so successfully

<lb/><p>In the <hi rend="italic">Eclair</hi> in six months, 49<hi rend="sup">.</hi>28 per cent.</p>
<lb/><p>But these heavy rates of mortality are surpassed by what 
<lb/>took place at the Gambia in 1825, where a detachment of one 
<lb/>hundred and eight men (whites) arrived at the end of May, 
<lb/>just as the rainy season commenced. Of this number there 
<lb/>remained alive on the 21st of September of the same year, 
<lb/>twenty-one, the mortality having been within the space of four 
<lb/>months 82<hi rend="sup">.</hi>85 per cent.</p>
<lb/><p>Another detachment of ninety-one men, which in the 
<w>mean-<lb break="no"/>time</w> had been on board of a transport at the anchorage, and 
<lb/>which while there did not lose a man, was landed about the 
<lb/>end of September, and made up the force to one hundred and 
<lb/>twelve. Of this number, there had perished of fever, sixty- 
<lb/>one; and of other diseases, includeding six from fever following 
<lb/>punishment, twelve; total, seventy-three, or at the rate of 
<lb/>65<hi rend="sup">.</hi>17 per cent. during less than three months.</p>
<lb/><p>During this fearful mortality, a detachment of from forty to 
<lb/>fifty black soldiers of the 2nd West India Regiment lost only 
<lb/>one man, and had seldom any in hospital.</p>
<lb/><p>To go back still further. Mungo Park, on his second journey 
<lb/>to the interior of Africa, left the Gambia on the 28th of April, 
<lb/>1805, having with him, besides his brother-in-law--Mr. 
<w>An-<lb break="no"/>derson,</w> Mr. Scott, and Lieut. Martin, thirty-four soldiers, four 
<lb/>carpenters, and two seamen--in all forty-four Europeans. He 
<lb/>did not reach the Niger at Bambakoo until the 19th of August, 
<lb/>far into the rainy season, having had to traverse five hundred 
<lb/>miles of country fertile of disease, and beset with danger. 
<lb/>Dysentery and fever had by this time made sad havoc amongst 
<lb/>his people, for there remained alive only eleven of the whole, 
<lb/>and on the 11th of October all, save four, were dead. Whether 
<lb/>any white, except Lieut. Martin, survived to perish with him 
<lb/>under the rocks at Boussa some time in November, has not 
<lb/>been ascertained. Park himself had severe dysentery, which 
<lb/>he considered he cured himself of with mercury pushed to 
<lb/>salivation.</p>
