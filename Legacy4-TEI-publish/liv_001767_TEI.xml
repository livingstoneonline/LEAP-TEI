<lb/><p>Your beloved <persName>Mama</persName>
<lb/>is I trust in Heaven. She died 
<lb/>last night about seven <choice><sic>oclock</sic><corr>o'clock</corr></choice>
<lb/>and we shall never see her 
<lb/>till through mercy we meet in 
<lb/>Heaven. I have just come 
<lb/>back from laying her dear 
<lb/>form in the grave in the 
<lb/>hope of a blessed resurrection 
<lb/>Dear <persName>Nanie</persName> she often thought 
<lb/>of you and when once from 
<lb/>the violence of the disease 
<lb/>she was <term type="ailment">delirious</term>-She called 
<lb/>out "see, <persName>Agnes</persName> is falling

<lb/>Our Heavenly Saviour who must 
<lb/>be your Father and guide preserve 
<lb/>you from falling into the gulph of 
<lb/>sin over the precipice of temptation 
<lb/>She was ill seven days. I tended 
<lb/>her night and day myself. Yesterday 
<lb/>morning she asked me to open 
<lb/>the window of Shupanga house 
<lb/>just at dawn of day - and said 
<lb/>"I am not in <term type="ailment">pain</term> but cannot 
<lb/>help moaning" Soon after that 
<lb/>she lost power of drinking 
<lb/>which incessant <term type="ailment">vomiting</term>
<lb/>excited. then gradually became 
<lb/>insensible and at last as 
<lb/>she was breathing with her 
<lb/>mouth open - shut it as if to 
<lb/>breathe through her <term type="bodypart">nose</term> and 
<lb/>breathed no more. She looked

<lb/><!--hand0116-->exactly as if falling asleep and 
<lb/>I believe she did then fall asleep 
<lb/>in Jesus. Dear <persName>Agnes</persName> I feel 
<lb/>alone in the world now and 
<lb/>what will the poor dear <persName>baby</persName>
<lb/>do without her <persName>Mama</persName>. She 
<lb/>often spoke of her and sometimes 
<lb/>burst into a flood of tears in 
<lb/>speaking of her just as I now 
<lb/>do in taking up &amp; arranging 
<lb/>the things left by my beloved 
<lb/>partner of eighteen years. 
<lb/>I send most of <persName>Mama's</persName>
<lb/>things to you. You may 
<lb/>give what you like as 
<w>keep-<lb break="no"/>sakes</w> for the boys &amp; for little 
<lb/><persName>Anna Mary</persName> whom I never 
<lb/>saw. I bow to the Divine

<lb/>God grant that I may learn the 
<lb/>lesson he means to teach. All 
<lb/>she told you to do she now <unclear cert="high">enforces</unclear>
<lb/>as if beckoning you from 
<lb/>Heaven. <persName>Nanie</persName> dear meet her 
<lb/>there. Don't lose the crown of 
<lb/>joy, she now wears and the 
<lb/>Lord be gracious to you in all 
<lb/>things. You will now need to 
<lb/>act more &amp; more from a feeling 
<lb/>of responsibility to Jesus seeing he 
<lb/>has taken away one of your 
<lb/>guardians. A right 
<w>straight-<lb break="no"/>forward</w> woman was she. No 
<lb/>crooked way was ever hers &amp; 
<lb/>she could act with decision &amp; 
<lb/>energy when required. I pity you
