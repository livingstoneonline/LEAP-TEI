<lb/>Commissioner for the suppression of the slave 
<lb/>trade, <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">and the only Englishman I know in 
<lb/>the city,</del> most generously received me and my 27 
<lb/>Companions into his house. I shall never forget 
<lb/>the delicious pleasure of lying down on his bed 
<lb/>after sleeping six months on the ground, nor 
<lb/>the unwearied attention and kindness through a 
<lb/>long sickness which <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> G<add place="inline" hand="#hand02">abriel</add></persName> invariably shewed. 
<lb/>May God reward him. My companions were 
<lb/>struck with awe at the sight of a city, and 
<lb/>more especially when taken on board H. M. ships 
<lb/>of war. The kindness of the officers of the cruizers 
<lb/>removed the last vestige of fear from their minds, 
<lb/>for, finding them to be all my countrymen, they 
<lb/>saw the fallacy of the declarations <del type="strikethrough" hand="#hand02">of the 
<lb/>negroes of every village we came to west of 
<lb/><placeName>Cassange</placeName> - 'that the white man was taking

<lb/>the end of their lives at the prodigious quantity 
<lb/>of 'stones that burn' one ship could contain. 
<lb/>They previously imagined their own little canoes 
<lb/>on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> the best vessels, and themselves 
<lb/>the most expert sailors in the world.</p>
<lb/><p>"His Excellency the <persName>Bishop of 
<lb/>Angola</persName>, then the acting Governor of the 
<lb/>Province, received my companions with great 
<lb/>Kindness, and assured them of his protection and 
<lb/>friendship, as well as desire to promote 
<w>commer-<lb break="no"/>cial</w> intercourse with the Country of <persName>Sekeletu</persName>. 
<lb/>He also sent a present of a horse &amp; handsome 
<lb/>dress for that chief, and shewed very great 
<lb/>attention to myself in my sickness. The 
<lb/>Merchants too of <placeName>Loanda</placeName> took the opportunity 
<lb/>of our return to send presents to <persName>Sekeletu</persName>, and, 
<lb/>as they give much <unclear cert="low">envie</unclear> for the produce of 
<lb/>his country, than can be, or is done by 
<w>mer-<lb break="no"/>chants</w> from the <placeName>Cape Colony</placeName>, it is to be 
<lb/>hoped that intercourse with either <placeName>Cassange</placeName>
<lb/>or <placeName>Loanda</placeName>, will promote the civilization of 
<lb/>the Interior.</p>
<lb/><p>"I return, because I feel that 
<lb/>the work to which I set myself is only half 
<lb/>accomplished. The way out to the Eastern 
<lb/>Coast may be less difficult than I have found 
<lb/>that to the West. If I succeed, we shall at 
<lb/>least have a choice. <add place="marginright" hand="#hand03">Insert
