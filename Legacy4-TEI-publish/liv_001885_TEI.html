<br/>Nyassa being pretty deep would go 
<br/>aground, and was very difficult to 
<br/>get off. Further up the river had risen 
<br/>only one foot eleven inches instead of 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">15</span>about three feet, so we have lost 
<br/>more time than we anticipated. But 
<br/>no important work is ever 
<span class="" title="">accom-<br/>plished</span> without considerable trouble. </p>
                     <br/>
                     <p class="p ">We found that slave hunting and 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">20</span>famine had produced fearful effects 
<br/>during our absence. We counted about 
<br/>thirty two dead bodies floating down 
<br/>as we came up. The smiling villages 
<br/>where we could last year have bought 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">25</span>any amount of provisions are now 
<br/>all burned and we saw only a few 
<br/>starving people trying to save themselves 
<br/>from starving by fishing and collecting 
<br/>the seeds of grasses. Indeed our work 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">30</span>will be greatly increased for now 
<br/>we must get all our provisions for 
<br/>ourselves &amp; workmen from great distances 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
                        <br/>to me this retension of the slave trade is 
<br/>a great affliction. It destroys my hopes 
<br/>of benefitting the natives of the <span class="" title="full: yes; ">lower 
<br/>Shire</span>, and I only trust that we may do 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">5</span>some good service on <span class="" title="full: yes; ">Lake Nyassa.</span>
                        <br/>The <span class="" title="full: yes; ">Tette</span> people began the work of depopulation 
<br/>on our footsteps, then a half caste called

<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">10</span>been fearful. Others have made slave 
<br/>forays in other directions, and no 
<br/>Governor interferes until the culprit 
<br/>is rich enough to be squeezed. He is 
<br/>fined and allowed to begin again at 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">15</span>his old trade of slave hunting. The 
<br/>reason why no resistance can be

<br/>On the west coast <span class="" title="full: yes; ">Lord Palmerston</span>
                        <br/>put a squadron of men of war to stop 
<br/>the slave trade, and allow civilisation 
<br/>to begin its operations. Twenty missions 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">25</span>were established, and twenty dialects 
<br/>reduced to writing. some twelve thousand

                        <br/>into different churches, and thousands 
<br/>are educated. Good influences are

                        <span class="linenumber">30</span>spreading inland so that the lawful

than ever were engaged in the slave trade. 
<br/>I think <span class="" title="full: yes; ">Lord Palmerston</span> has done more 
<br/>for Africa than any man who has 
<br/>appeared, and he did it in spite of much 
<br/>misrepresentation. I have heard men say 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">5</span>that the squadron rather increased than 
<br/>diminished the horrors of the slave trade, 
<br/>Even officers said they were doing more 
<br/>harm than good. He persevered in 
<br/>spite of it all, and is an example 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">10</span>you should copy. Take a right course 
<br/>and go through with it whatever 
<br/>men may say or think. Well while 
<br/>all that was doing on the <span class="" title="full: yes; ">West coast,</span>
                        <br/>nothing has been doing here, because 
<br/>
                        <span class="linenumber">15</span>only a few convicts have been 
<span class="" title="">intro-<br/>duced,</span> and we can see reason to fear 
<br/>that even our efforts will be frustrated.

<br/>into an unhealthy corner by slave

<br/>finding it much more difficult
