<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>With a sore heart I have 
<lb/>to tell of the loss of my bosom friend 
<lb/>of eighteen years. She died on the 
<lb/>27<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> the complaint having the 
<lb/>worst complication continued 
<lb/>vomiting by which all the remedies 
<lb/>were rejected. We have been 
<lb/>three months down in the Delta 
<lb/>instead of as I anticipated three 
<lb/>or four days. I bitterly regret now 
<lb/>having consented to her coming 
<lb/>this time, but matters have 
<lb/>taken a turn so utterly beyond my 
<lb/>control that I bow to the will 
<lb/>of the Almighty Disposer of events. 
<lb/>I thought that Lady Nyassa could 
<lb/>sail out &amp; on reaching <placeName>Kongone</placeName>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001778_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>cut wood &amp; steam up to the cataracts 
<lb/>but she might have been lost. When 
<lb/><persName>Captain Wilson</persName> volunteered to help us 
<lb/>up to the cataracts I thought all would 
<lb/>then turn out right we should only be 
<lb/>a week or two down here. But Pioneer 
<lb/>as I thought failed to carry 35 tons. 
<lb/>We landed the sections at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>there was some tinkering at the engines 
<lb/>and we came back to the sea in one 
<lb/>day. We took 3 weeks to go up. I still 
<lb/><add place="above">at that time</add> put the blame on her having been 
<lb/>overloaded. She was down to five feet. 
<lb/>But Gorgon had been driven away 
<lb/>and during seventeen days we were 
<lb/>detained at the <placeName>Kongone</placeName> nothing was 
<lb/>done to the Engines. After the Gorgon 
<lb/>had left the air pump was opened, 
<lb/>and happening to go down I saw 
<lb/>at least a quarter of an inch of 
<lb/>sand round the plunger &amp; it had 
<lb/>worn a great way into the cylinder 
<lb/>on the working parts. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he trunions 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001778_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>which had not been packed for 20 
<lb/>months were repacked then, and we 
<lb/>were detained a day &amp; a half while that 
<lb/>was done. We went up to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>with a load which brought her down 
<lb/>again to 5 feet in 2 1/2 days steaming - 
<lb/>We grounded a day. Now it is not 
<lb/>the Engineer's fault that we go 
<lb/>aground - but the feed pump ought 
<lb/>to be disconnected at once and 
<lb/>the boiler supplied by the donkey 
<lb/>engine. She ought not to be allowed 
<lb/>to pump in sand. When the 
<lb/>other valves come the Engine will 
<lb/>be quite safe. I tell you all this 
<lb/>without one ill feeling towards the 
<lb/>Engineer, he has become respectful 
<lb/>again &amp; probably he was irritated 
<lb/>by some of the officers of the Gorgon 
<lb/>as it is evident he does not feel 
<lb/>kindly towards the service. But 
<lb/>I think it only fair to explain 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001778_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>what without any engineering know
<lb/>ledge appears to have been 
<lb/>the cause of the wretched failure of the 
<lb/>Pioneer in carrying 35 tons. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he list

<lb/><p><persName>Gwilliam</persName> the quarter master

<lb/>lately <persName>Gwilliam</persName> assaulted <persName>Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>and I have to give <persName>Gwilliam</persName> over 
<lb/>to a man of war for trial. I am 
<lb/>very sorry for <persName>Gwilliam</persName> for he 
<lb/>behaved well during our period up 
<lb/>the river and is a good hard working 
<lb/>man. When in drink however he 
<lb/>is bad. While among Portuguese 
<lb/>the men do get drink and we 
<lb/>had much dysentery &amp; illness. We 
<lb/>could not get fresh meat except 
<lb/>at enormous prices &amp; having no 
<lb/>flour the beans caused irritation 
<lb/>of the bowels. We part with a number 
<lb/>of the men - when we meet a man

<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> put the hull together in 
<lb/>a fortnight with but a very few 
<lb/>hands - but for the sad event which 
<lb/>casts a gloom over all my horizon 
<lb/>I should have felt delighted. I cannot 
<lb/>spare my brother though I thought 
<lb/>of reducing our expenditure by sending 
<lb/>him home. We shall need every 
<lb/>hand at Roadmaking &amp; carriage<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We have about 4 months 
<lb/>provisions - we <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the 
<lb/>preserved meats you sent but 
<lb/>the ale by 10 dozens remains 
<lb/>somewhere. I feel sorry that 
<lb/>your kindness is stopped in its 
<lb/>flow - where I cannot divine 
<lb/>we <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> it but twice - eight 
<lb/>was the number in one - the other 
<lb/>much less. It surely could be 
<lb/>traced. It would have saved us 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001778_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'-->
<lb/>a great deal of money. I had to 
<lb/>buy mess rum for our crew 
<lb/>at 10/ per gallon. I would have 
<lb/>let them want rather but 
<lb/>thought at the time we should 
<lb/>get the sections up to the cataracts 
<lb/>and wished to give them 
<lb/>their grog while working ashore. 
<lb/>I shall enclose my accounts 
<lb/>in a letter which will go to 
<lb/>the <placeName>Cape</placeName> in July. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName>
<lb/>is going to give quarterly 
<lb/>accounts of expenditure as 
<lb/>we ought to have done all 
<lb/>along. We have no forms 
<lb/>for it. I am a good deal out 
<lb/>of pocket at present and 
<lb/>have not enough private 
<lb/>money to pay our six

<lb/>12 more when these leave we 
<lb/>shall do with but few Europeans 
<lb/><persName>Captain Oldfield</persName> has promised to send them. They have never 
<lb/>once been sick until lately. </p>
<lb/><p>My poor wife had made 
<lb/>ample provision for making 
<lb/>Lady Nyassa a comfortable home 
<lb/>for us all. We find evidence 
<lb/>of this in her boxes. As a great 
<lb/>deal was new I have selected the 
<lb/>best and any keepsakes for her 
<lb/>daughters and send them in three 
<lb/>boxes, to the care of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Frederick 
<lb/>Fitch</persName>. I have taken the liberty 
<lb/>of addressing them to you. We 
<lb/>took plenty of table linen &amp; towels 
<lb/>for the Lady Nyassa<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>I would just add that the water is still 
<lb/>high but falling fast. I think we shall 
<lb/>get up the <placeName>Shire</placeName> in June. We have a 
<lb/>fair prospect of being able to do our 
<lb/>work comfortably. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> &amp; <persName>C Livingstone</persName>
