<lb/><p>II.</p>
<lb/><p>My dear <persName>Sir Roderick</persName></p>
<lb/><p>We unfortunately missed the opportunity 
<lb/>of sending overland by the Elephant hunters 
<lb/>so I open the letter written at <placeName>Sesheke</placeName> to insert 
<lb/>some further particulars. 
<lb/>The river was so 
<lb/>low we could easily see to the bottom of one half 
<lb/>of the Fizzure which forms <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName>. And 
<lb/>indeed people could wade from the North bank 
<lb/>to my garden island to form a stockade for 
<lb/>fresh seeds. The depth is not 100 feet but 310 
<lb/>feet, probably a few feet more as the weight 
<lb/>attached to the line rested on a slope near the 
<lb/>bottom. The breadth from bank to bank is 
<lb/>not one thousand yards as I conjectured in 
<lb/>1855 but between one statute and one 
<lb/>geographical mile. We say 1860 yards to 
<lb/>assist the memory, but it is a little more 
<lb/>yet not quite 2000 yards. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he lips of the crack 
<lb/>at Garden island may be more than 80 feet 
<lb/>as we could not throw a stone across, but 
<lb/>the sextant gave that. Now come to the 
<lb/>other or <add place="above">South</add> Eastern side of the crack and the 
<lb/>fizzure which from the upper bed looks like 
<lb/>the letter <figure><!--<graphic url="LETT1138-1.gif"/>--></figure> is prolonged in a most remarkably 
<lb/>zigzag manner. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he water after leaping sheer 
<lb/>down 310 feet is collected from both ends 
<lb/>to the upright part of the letter as the escape 
<lb/>and then flows away in the zigzag part 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001592_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/><figure><!--<graphic style="float:left" url="LETT1138-2.gif"/>--></figure> the promontories formed thereby are 
<lb/><choice><sic>are</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> flat at the top and of the same level 
<lb/>as the bed of the river above the Falls 
<lb/>the base of the first on the right is only 
<lb/>400 paces from the Fall Fizzure and 
<lb/>that on the left about 150. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir sides 
<lb/>are as perpendicular as the Fall and 
<lb/>you can walk along among the trees 
<lb/>and by a few steps see the river some 300 or 400 
<lb/>feet below jammed in a space of some 20 or 
<lb/>30 yards and of a deep green colour. As a whole 
<lb/>the <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName> are the most wonderful in 
<lb/>the world. Even now at extreme low water 
<lb/>or when it is 2 feet lower than we ever saw 
<lb/>it there are eight hundred feet of water falling 
<lb/>on the right of garden island. And the two 
<lb/>columns of vapour with the glorious 
<w>rain-<lb break="no"/>bows</w> are a sight worth seeing. A fall called 
<lb/><placeName>Momba</placeName> or <placeName>Moamba</placeName>, below this is interesting 
<lb/>chiefly because you look down to it from 
<lb/>a height <add place="above">of</add> some 500 feet. It is really nothing 
<lb/>after <placeName>Mosioatunya.</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>We visited the river twice on our way 
<lb/>down to <placeName>Sinamames</placeName> &amp; found it in a very deep 
<lb/>crack. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he boiling point gives 1600 feet of <unclear cert="low">descent</unclear>
<lb/>from the falls to <placeName>Sinamanes</placeName><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat</persName> informs me that all the rivers in <persName>Mosilikatze's 
<lb/>country</persName> run N.W. or N.N. West. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey enter 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>above <persName>Sinamanes</persName> and above 
<lb/>a remarkable mountain, which possibly 
<lb/>was the dam that shut in the waters of the ancient 
<lb/>Lake before <placeName>Mosioatunya</placeName> was made. They 
<lb/>are therefore not where from oral information 
<lb/>they have been put in the map. <del type="strikethrough">A conjecture </del>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001592_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he whole country below and around the falls 
<lb/>has been the scene of comparatively recent volcanic 
<lb/>operations &amp; some parts look as recent as 
<lb/>Aden. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>ome are of frothy lava and all present 
<lb/>a burnt appearance like <choice><sic>κατακουmενη</sic><corr>κατακουμενη</corr></choice><add place="above">Catacacaumena</add> in 
<lb/><placeName>Greece</placeName> - (I fear my Greek is at fault) A conjecture 
<lb/>that the <add place="above">calcareous</add> tufa of Sesheke valley was emitted 
<lb/>from a volcano like that which covered the 
<lb/>cities <placeName>Pompei</placeName> and <placeName>Herculaneum</placeName> does not 
<lb/>account for the roots of reeds therein over 
<lb/>the <unclear cert="low">bidental sauvans</unclear> of the ancient Lakes 
<lb/>and I question if a volcano ever threw mud 
<lb/>over 200 miles square as this lake has done. 
<lb/>Wherever we have had igneous action in 
<lb/>this country we have had large quantities 
<lb/>of tufa bearing water after it. I cannot 
<lb/>account for the enormous quantity of 
<lb/>gravel and shingle below the Falls. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>bed of the river and country generally 
<lb/>are covered with it to considerable depths 
<lb/>there is none above the falls and none 
<lb/>below Chicova<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>We purchased canoes and dropped down 
<lb/>stream in order to examine all at low water 
<lb/><placeName>Kansalo</placeName>is no difficulty - <placeName>Kariba</placeName> a few 
<lb/>miles below is a basaltic dyke stretched 
<lb/>across the stream, but it has a wide  
<lb/>opening in it dangerous for canoes 
<lb/>the gunwales of which were only 6 inches 
<lb/>above the water. A <add place="above">at</add><placeName><unclear cert="low">Mburumas</unclear></placeName> there is 
<lb/>a rapid of about 100 yards in length which 
<lb/>runs at six knots an hour. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is the 
<lb/>most rapid part we have seen in the whole 
<lb/>river. We measured the most rapid part 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001592_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>below <placeName>Chicova</placeName> on our way up and found 
<lb/>it to be under four knots. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut a fall of 
<lb/>about 15 feet before our return developed 
<lb/>several dangerous rapids &amp; even cataracts 
<lb/>which were quite smooth when we passed 
<lb/><placeName>Chicova</placeName> seemed <add place="above">from the shore</add> a trap dyke across the 
<lb/>stream like <placeName>Kariba</placeName> but it had two openings. 
<lb/>We passed through either the one or the other 
<lb/>without observing the dyke - but we saw a 
<lb/>large seam of fine coal in the bank. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is 
<lb/>another in the bank at <placeName>Manyerire hill</placeName> and 
<lb/>besides seeing fragments of the mineral in 
<lb/>many rivulets on both banks we verified 
<lb/>the existence of the coal field <unclear cert="low">north of</unclear><placeName>Zumbo</placeName>
<lb/>only as I formerly pointed out <add place="above">but</add> to nearly <del type="strikethrough">to</del><placeName>Sinamanes</placeName> below <placeName>Victoria Falls. </placeName>The 
<lb/>only real difficulty in the river is <placeName>Morumbua</placeName>
<lb/>and that could be passed in full flood for 
<lb/>a rise of eighty feet must smooth it over. </p>
<lb/><p>On arriving here two days ago we had travelled 
<lb/>from <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> &amp; back some 1400 miles the 
<lb/>greater part on foot. We have thus kept faith 
<lb/>with the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> though we have done nothing 
<lb/>else. <del type="strikethrough">Of Sekweba, Sekelutu said "He was my 
<lb/>child and died for me" I wished ten and sixteen 
<lb/>came but most fear the fate of Sekwebu &amp; of 
<lb/>those who died of smallpox.</del> We were swamped 
<lb/>once, but the men behaved admirably, leaping 
<lb/>out and swimming alongside till we got 
<lb/>into smooth water. In another place one canoe 
<lb/>was upset and property lost. We then abandoned 
<lb/>the canoes and came home on foot thankful 
<lb/>to say all well. </p>
