<lb/><salute>My Dear <persName>Watt</persName></salute></opener>
<lb/><p><choice><sic>Recieved</sic><corr>Received</corr></choice> your <bibl>first note</bibl> dated <placeName><settlement type="town">Northwich</settlement></placeName> by <placeName><region><w>Ches<add place="below">^</add><add place="above">h</add>ire</w></region></placeName> <date when="1850-08-17">yesterday</date> and with pleasure begin
<lb/>an answer before the mental stimulus it imparted has evaporated. Happy to hear you are settled
<lb/>in a sphere of usefulness. We hope you will prove a blessing and make yours a working
<lb/>church. I think if <orgName>Christians</orgName> are not set to act on the masses of heathenism around
<lb/>them they soon get to quarrelling and plague the "incumbent" who as the word I believe
<lb/>implies is a weight lying on them. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> understand how the mental work of <term type="occupation">ministers</term> is
<lb/>harder than that of <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>. If one spins long yarns out of his own noddle
<lb/>instead of out of the infinite variety of motives inducements persuasions &amp; threatenings &amp;c
<lb/>drawn from Heaven earth &amp; Hell &amp; ready made for him in the <bibl>Bible</bibl>. I should think
<lb/>him in a pretty "fix" &amp; fancy I see him sweating at every pore in close embrace of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName> Difficulty
<lb/>But I observed that one of the most useful <term type="occupation">ministers</term> in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> <persName>Mr Sherman</persName> had very
<lb/>little in his sermons of his own weaving and I believe you wish to be useful more than <w>any<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>thing</w> else. <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Leifchild</persName> seemed much the same as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sherman</persName> Will you enlighten my
<lb/>darkness in reference to the  mental labour which can be dispensed with here. I suspect
<lb/>young <term type="occupation">ministers</term> often shoot over their peoples' heads by taking it for granted that
<lb/>they know the simple elementary truths of the gospel - I may as well give it to you
<lb/>for twitting me anent the <orgName>Committee</orgName>. I am no <orgName>anti Phillipite</orgName>. Nor am I an <orgName>anti <w>Committee<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-man</w></orgName>. I think that a set of ignoramuses with but little principle in them would be best    
<lb/>managed by a <term type="occupation">bishop</term> or <term type="occupation">Archdeacon</term> or something of that sort. If the body of <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>
<lb/>had a little more knowledge or principle then they would be entitled to a committee
<lb/>or <orgName><term type="faith">Presbytery</term></orgName>. If they possessed the highest degree of principle &amp; piety then they might
<lb/>be allowed to act as <choice><sic>independants</sic><corr>independents</corr></choice> of the other words. <orgName><term type="faith">Episcopacy</term></orgName> for the most
<lb/>ignorant, <orgName><term type="faith">Presbytery</term></orgName> for the better informed &amp; <orgName><choice><sic>Independancy</sic><corr>Independency</corr></choice></orgName> for the highest order
<lb/>of moral excellence, <orgName>Despotism</orgName> for the barbarian (<placeName><country>Russia</country></placeName>) mixed monarchy for the <!-- Adrian, not sure if these past few lines qualify for orgName tags, so pls correct as necessary.

<lb/>more civilized (<placeName><country>Britain</country></placeName>) &amp; Democracy for the most civilized (<placeName><country>United States</country></placeName>) Committees
<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> work well here. It is my full &amp; sorrowful conviction that there is no more <term type="faith">Christian</term>
<lb/>affection between the members of <orgName>our Committee</orgName> than there is between my riding <term type="animal">ox</term> and
<lb/>his grandmother. Had it been possible to foresee the state of feeling now existing I should
<lb/>never have formed <orgName>the mission</orgName>. <persName>Sechele</persName> made a very fair promise to become an <unclear cert="medium">eminent</unclear>
<lb/><orgName>Christian</orgName>. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Inglis</persName> who never saw him was visited by one of <orgName><persName><choice><abbr>S</abbr><expan>Sechele</expan></choice></persName>'s people</orgName> and <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>I</abbr><expan>Inglis</expan></choice></persName> took the
<lb/>opportunity of spewing forth a volley of abuse upon <persName>Sechele</persName>, so very gross the man a heathen
<lb/>would not repeat his words to me. He repeatedly asked his authority for his statements
<lb/>but <persName>Inglis</persName> would not <unclear cert="medium">mention</unclear> it. The man of course told his <term type="occupation">chief</term> and I suspect the
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term>'s declension commenced. We make but little headway in this country Even <persName>Ross</persName> <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>who admits members more <term type="faith">presbyterians</term> cannot be said to be doing much. A triennial deputation
<lb/>would perhaps be better than a committee for us for without joking we are a sorry set of
<lb/>fellows. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomson</persName> late of Bellary is to be our <foreign xml:lang="la"><term type="occupation">Prelatus</term></foreign> and <term type="occupation">agent</term>. I just now notice
<lb/>that I am becoming latinized in style. If you get through thus far with your dictionary
<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> grumble for I will try &amp; amend - <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Freeman</persName> thinks I ought to have my extra
<lb/>expenses paid which I suppose is as good as done. He seems very friendly to us - and regarding
<lb/>all the friendship of the wise &amp; good as tokens of the Divine goodness to me my obligations
<lb/>to the Father of lights are greatly increased. Sorry to hear of the attack on the old  <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Whish</persName> was <supplied cert="medium">a</supplied> personal friend of mine though I never saw him. The old lady wished me to
<lb/>write her and was very fond of <bibl>my letters</bibl> to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Whish</persName> but she did not leave anything to me
<lb/>so we are as the boys say "quits" <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Whish</persName> lately excited himself to get an iron plough for
<lb/>me and I believe it is on the way. But notwithstanding all that it would still take
<lb/>an immense deal to make me think ill of the good old <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wardlaw</persName>. The boys in
<lb/>the <orgName>Academy</orgName> <unclear cert="medium">seem</unclear> to have attained to the status of the sweet <term type="occupation">singer</term> of <placeName><country>Israel</country></placeName>, when he found
<lb/>himself wiser than all his <term type="occupation">teachers</term>. Unmerciful expulsion ought to be the verdict unless
<lb/>the body of <term type="occupation">students</term> is unanimous in the charges preferred. Esteem on the part of
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">student</term> is essential to his success. The parcel from you of which I have been advised
<lb/>has not yet reached us. I shall inform you when it does. I see your relatives as I

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">Well I expect you hope for some more information about the Lake. We have revisited <!-- geog: Ngami --><!-- Adrian, this is the only Lake mentioned in this letter, but pls correct if it's in fact another unnamed lake. HB --><!-- Looks OK. AW -->
<lb/>it. My wife &amp; children, <persName>Sechele</persName> &amp; a <orgName>party of 20 <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term></orgName> &amp; our <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teacher</term> <persName>Mebaloe</persName> formed
<lb/>the cavalcade. Went to <placeName><settlement type="village"><persName>Sekhomi</persName>'s</settlement></placeName>. After salutations I said I passed you last year because
<lb/>I knew you did not wish me to get into the Lake. He replied <foreign xml:lang="und">u'nstile mi kia boka</foreign> You <!-- geog: Ngami -->
<lb/>surpassed me, &amp; I thank you. (or give in) We had more intercourse with the <term type="tribe">Bakalaboka</term>
<lb/>than last year and having gone in <seg type="weather">shortly after the rains fell</seg> and plenty of water. When
<lb/>we reached the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zouga</geogName></placeName> it was just beginning to flow and <term type="ailment">fever</term> prevailed. We crossed
<lb/>and went upon the North bank intending to go to <persName>Sebitoane</persName> but when near the junction
<lb/>of the <unclear cert="medium">Tamunakll</unclear> &amp; <placeName><geogName type="river">Zouga</geogName></placeName> got intelligence of the existence of the fly styled "<term type="insect">Tsetse</term>" <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> thought
<lb/>she would like to stand down at this Botaiawa town while I went North on <term type="animal">ox</term>back. <!-- Adrian, the w tag won't let me encaps the term tag here, so how to code properly? HB --><!-- I think it's OK to leave as is. AW -->
<lb/>When we reached that point we found <term type="ailment">fever</term> raging. Two <term type="people">Englishmen</term> had come up for
<lb/>ivory - a third one &amp; a <term type="tribe">Hottentot</term> died of it. The whole party were put to a standstill by
<lb/>the <term type="ailment">fever</term>. I coaxed up one of the <term type="people">Englishmen</term> from the gates of the grave and he repaid
<lb/>my kindness by cheating me! We only remained a week with the <term type="tribe">Botaiawa</term>. One of
<lb/>the days was put in taking down my wife to take a peep at the Lake. The children <!-- geog: Ngami -->
<lb/>took to playing in it as <term type="animal">ducklings</term> do. "Paddling" in it was grand fun, Immediately
<lb/>on our return a <term type="occupation">driver</term> &amp; <term type="occupation">leader</term> were knocked down by the <term type="ailment">fever</term>. Then two of
<lb/>the children and then other three of the party - this made me give up the idea of going
<lb/>any farther. We spent two pleasant Sundays with the <term type="tribe">Botaiawa</term>. But I was obliged
<lb/>to become <term type="occupation">driver</term> in order to get away on Monday. The Lake is the great focus of <!-- geog: Ngami -->
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever</term>. And when fairly away our party were in mercy restored to health. The <term type="tribe">Botaiawa</term>
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term> was more friendly this year than last - the friendship began in the <orgName>African</orgName> manner
<lb/>by his taking an intense longing for a beautiful gun presented to me by <persName><choice><abbr>Lieut<hi rend="sup">t</hi></abbr><expan>Lieutenant</expan></choice>
<lb/>Arkwright</persName>. He promised me <term type="occupation">guides</term> to take me to <persName>Sebituane</persName> although he refused them
<lb/>to a <term type="occupation">trader</term> who offered him any reward he chose to ask - said he would supply
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> with <term type="animal">elephants'</term> flesh &amp;c during my absence and added if I knew his character
<lb/>&amp; friendship I should have no hesitation in trusting him anent my family <hi rend="underline">&amp; gun</hi>.
<lb/>I immediately handed it to him. Had we been permitted to go to <placeName><settlement type="village"><persName>Sebitoane</persName>'s</settlement></placeName> the act of
<lb/>confidence would have been more than repaid. It is of great importance to gain
<lb/>the confidence of these fellows in the beginning. I was mistaken in supposing that
<lb/><term type="ailment">Pneumonia</term> is the only complaint prevalent there. We found real <term type="ailment">Paludal fever</term>
<lb/>And it descends every year the <orgName>natives</orgName> say from the North with or previous to the
<lb/>annual flow of waters. Providence seems determined to keep <placeName><region>Intertropical
<lb/>Africa</region></placeName> for the <orgName>black races</orgName>. No <orgName>European</orgName> could live on the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Ngami</geogName></placeName>. A <seg type="weather">more
<lb/>salubrious climate</seg> must exist farther up to the North. And that the country is <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>higher seems evident from the fact mentioned by the <term type="tribe">Bahkoba</term> that the
<lb/>water of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Teoge</geogName></placeName> the river which falls into the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Ngami</geogName></placeName> at the North West
<lb/>part of it flows with great rapidity. Canoes ascending punt all the way
<lb/>and the men must hold on by the reed in order to prevent being carried back
<lb/>by the current. Large trees <term type="animal">springbucks</term> &amp; other <term type="animal">antelopes</term> are sometimes
<lb/>brought down by it. Do you wonder at my pressing on in the way we have
<lb/>done. The <orgName><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> mission</orgName> has been carried on in a cul de sac. I tried to
<lb/>break through by going among the <orgName><placeName><region>Eastern</region></placeName> tribes</orgName> but the <orgName>Boers</orgName> shut up the
<lb/>field A <term type="nationality">French</term> <term type="occupation">missionary</term> - <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fridoux</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="village">Motito</settlement></placeName> later tried to follow
<lb/>on my trail to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> but was turned back by a party of armed
<lb/>men. When he burst through the Barrier on the North. It appeared
<lb/>very plain that no mission could be successful there unless we could
<lb/>go <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">to</add> a well-watered country having a passage to the sea on either the
<lb/><placeName><region>East</region></placeName> or <placeName><region>West coast</region></placeName>. This project I am almost afraid to moot but
<lb/>nothing less will do. I intend <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="illegible"/> to go in <date when="1851">next year</date> and remain a
<lb/>twelve-month. My wife poor soul I pity her, proposed to let me go for that
<lb/>time while she remains at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> - You will pray for us both during
<lb/>that period. Referring to the above I cannot but smile when I think
<lb/>of one gentleman (<persName>Inglis</persName>) going about the country for years pretending he could <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>not get a sphere of labour although he never made a Latitude of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName>

                <pb facs="liv_000699_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>I have heard him hinting that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> had told stories when he said that there were
<lb/>any people at all in the country. What <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> asserted was that no one knew the <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>termination of <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> country</region></placeName>. I felt disappointed to find so small a population
<lb/>to the South of this but go far enough and you will see plenty of people. I should
<lb/>say <del type="strikethrough">from</del> <add place="above">on</add> good grounds that the <term type="tribe">Sitchuana</term> will carry a man <measure>a thousand miles</measure>
<lb/>beyond this and how much farther nobody knows. It is however upon the whole
<lb/>a thinly peopled country. The only prolific people in it are the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>. We have <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>four children already. Did you see certain resolutions passed at a meeting at
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Leeds</settlement></placeName>. With all due deference to the superior knowledge &amp; judgement of the <orgName><placeName><settlement type="city">Leeds</settlement></placeName> worthies</orgName>
<lb/>I suspect they did not very well know what to do with themselves. They talk of a
<lb/>"lapse of 50 years" as requiring a little friendly enquiry, in innocent <w>unconscious<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-ness</w> that 2 years have not elapsed since there was as much of both hostile
<lb/>and friendly enquiry as would have satisfied most reasonable men. And
<lb/>then they exalt their "most valued <term type="occupation">secretary</term> <persName>Rev J.G. Miall</persName>" to the skies, for what,
<lb/>letting groundless suspicions become known, and penning resolutions which
<lb/>devour each other like Pharoah's lean <term type="animal">kine</term>. This (Aside) we suspect these
<lb/>fellows <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> allow the mission churches so much liberty as they ought to have) But
<lb/><add place="marginleft">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi></add> <term type="occupation">Directors</term>, Remember we must have the mission churches <choice><sic>independant</sic><corr>independent</corr></choice>
<lb/>self supported - self governed. We <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> allow you to lord it over them. Then
<lb/>2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> <term type="occupation">Directors</term> - why do you allow these free <choice><sic>independant</sic><corr>independent</corr></choice> churches to
<lb/>so use their liberty in reference to <orgName><choice><abbr>Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi></abbr><expan>Government</expan></choice></orgName> grants for education? Coerce them
<lb/>instanter. They know that <choice><sic>independant</sic><corr>independent</corr></choice> self supported self governed churches
<lb/>at home can do as they like on the same subject. Out &amp; out voluntary as
<lb/>I am I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> like to see the <term type="occupation">Directors</term> pushed up into a corner &amp; forced
<lb/>by these <placeName><settlement type="city">Leeds</settlement></placeName> bullies to proclaim freedom &amp; coercion with the same breath
<lb/>and then to crown all they part stroking each <choice><sic>others</sic><corr>other's</corr></choice> backs and puffing
<lb/>about the "excellent spirit which characterized this meeting". Excellent
<lb/>spirit forsooth. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tidman</persName> displayed an excellent spirit in submitting to
<lb/>be poked by the hour without telling them what they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> seem to know
<lb/>that the <term type="occupation">agents</term> of the <orgName><choice><abbr>L.M.S.</abbr><expan><placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> Missionary Society</expan></choice></orgName> both at home &amp; abroad are the worst
<lb/>paid of all the <choice><sic><orgName>Societie</orgName>'s</sic><corr><orgName>societies</orgName>'</corr></choice> <term type="occupation">agents</term> in existence: If it had been a liberal spirit
<lb/>they would have proposed that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tidman</persName> be requested to accept the £<app><rdg>500</rdg><rdg>600</rdg></app>. As it is now
<lb/>he gives £100 annually to <orgName>the society</orgName>. Or they would have passed a resolution that
<lb/>as all their suspicions were groundless they double their subscriptions for the
<lb/>future. Why <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> you give them a few hints - sitting on your watch tower
<lb/>I think you might enjoy poking those who go too far even in the right direction.
<lb/>There are fools among the new lights no doubt as you have among the old lights who
<lb/>will say anything. And sometimes a rough sentence will come out of the mouth
<lb/>of a wise man - but you would not condemn a whole <unclear cert="medium">party</unclear> on that account
<lb/>I know. That which makes me think favourably of them is the practice
<lb/>If obliged to vote I should decide for those who are right in practice although
<lb/>they might be as I believe the new lights are about half a hairsbreadth wrong in
<lb/>theology. I think it was an immense absurdity to throw them off. You <orgName><term type="people">Scotch</term>

<lb/>Have heard nothing as yet from any source except from you about what the

<lb/>you will get through this at two sittings. No large paper. I suppose in your
