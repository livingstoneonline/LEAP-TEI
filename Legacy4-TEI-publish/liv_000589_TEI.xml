<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName><date when="1845-08-13">13 Aug 1845</date></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p>The bearer of this to <persName>Moiloe</persName> is a <term type="tribe">Mokwain</term>
<lb/>sent by <persName>Khake</persName> to announce the death of <persName>Bube</persName>, which 
<lb/>took place a few days ago. As you may not hear 
<lb/>a correct version of the circumstances which 
<lb/>preceded that even, I may mention that it was 
<lb/>occasioned by an explosion of gunpowder. The 
<lb/>people had been out hunting elephants, and having 
<lb/>killed none thought the reason must have been 
<lb/>in their ammunition not being charned. The 
<lb/>principal men were therefore requested to try 
<lb/>the same medicines they employ in charming 
<lb/>their spears. All the powder in the town 
<lb/>was collected on a kaross &amp; the three principal 
<lb/>men with medicine burning (roots, I suppose) 
<lb/>came close, and pointing the stuff to the combustible 
<lb/>material uttered a sort of whistling incantation 
<lb/>The explosion burned <persName>Bube</persName> nearly all over. His 
<lb/>body was <foreign xml:lang="und">nama hela</foreign> The others suffered chiefly 
<lb/>in the limbs &amp; face. From their description 
<lb/>of the quantity of powder, it seems to have been 
<lb/>about 10 or 12 <choice><abbr>lbs.</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> in amount. They sent 
<lb/>immediately to <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName> for medicine, but 
<lb/>I was gone to <persName>Sechele</persName>'s. Having followed me 
<lb/>thither I gave them a note to <persName>Mary</persName>, and the 

	

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000589_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>poor fellows trudged all the way back again. But 
<lb/><persName>Bube</persName> was no more before the medicine arrived 
<lb/>The people don't wish it to be known in what way 
<lb/>the fire was communicated to the powder. They 
<lb/>say there was no fire near, and as some of the 
<lb/>powder was procured form <persName>Sechele</persName> they may 
<lb/>believe it to have been bewitched. But the above 
<lb/>account I received from some <term type="tribe">Bamaleti</term> who 
<lb/>were there at the time the accident happened, 
<lb/>and who can have no motive for falsifyting it.</p>
<lb rend="center"/><p>In my last by <persName>Paulo</persName> I informed you of our 
<lb/>determination to leave <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName> as soon as possible 
<lb/>I took our trees &amp; planted them as the first step 
<lb/>bought sufficient ground fro three large gardens 
<lb/>for a gun, some ammunition &amp; beads. <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>said he never expected that we should buy it 
<lb/>but the whole of the plot being cultivated I could 
<lb/>not request him to remove his people from 
<lb/>their gardens without renumeration. He was 
<lb/>highly pleased with the price. In the event of 
<lb/>removal it is stipulated that the missionaries 
<lb/>are to receive an equal amount of garden 
<lb/>ground for nothing. I intend to build a good 
<lb/>large house, whether the station be permanent 
<lb/>or not, we shall have the pleasure of it 
<lb/>while there. <persName>Mary</persName> says this is not an inch 
<lb/>too large for us. I got next week to begin &amp;

	

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000589_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>if I am no longer with it that I was with this, it 
<lb/>will be fit for residence in December or January 
<lb/>I should have left this week, but did not like to 
<lb/>leave my dear rib to encounter <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName> alone. I left 
<lb/>a note for <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName> when I went last time. <persName>Mary</persName> had 
<lb/>just delivered it when I arrived &amp; he had not troubled 
<lb/>her. The note was to the effect "that he  <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>E</persName>
<lb/>was to set his mind completely at rest respecting 
<lb/>my leaving <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName>; he might consider the 
<lb/>whole establishment as entirely in his hands" -- 
<lb/>And in order to prevent him concieving I did this now 
<lb/>in order to impede his Colonial journey, I stated 
<lb/>that I did it simply to relieve his mind from 
<lb/>the great anxiety he seemed to feel for my 
<lb/>departure. I shall not alter my plan of preaching 
<lb/>or keeping school while here, though I have renounced 
<lb/>connection with the station. I likewise requested 
<lb/>him to furnish his letter to the Directors in its 
<lb/>original form only. I intend making use of my 
<lb/>notes of it in that form &amp; no other.</p>
<lb/><p>I greatly long to hear what you have 
<lb/>thought of our correspondence. I did not wish 
<lb/>to keep up the quarrel, but did not see the 
<lb/>smallest probability of any amicable arrangement 
<lb/>being come to by our meeting alone. I do not 
<lb/>expect it by our meeting at all, but the 
<lb/>gross perversions he has penned of what 
<lb/>I said made me afraid again to come into 

	

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000589_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>interview with him the very first "charge" is false 
<lb/>I never charged him with putting out a member from 
<lb/>revenge. And all the others are culled out of the 
<lb/>"interview" Now when I saw by the written charges 
<lb/>that he had shifted the ground of his attack entirely 
<lb/>I believe unless I had a witness to attest what might 
<lb/>pass he might get something more against me 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>Edwards</persName> has not put a single point against 
<lb/>me exactly as it happened. Now I had no witness 
<lb/>here. I should have been very glad of an interview 
<lb/>had I only had one witness. In what I wrote 
<lb/>I tried to be frank &amp; plain. I believe as I told 
<lb/>you before when he got the assurance that I should 
<lb/>leave he gained the point he wished from 
<lb/>the first. Had <persName>Ashton</persName> not been as he has been 
<lb/>the second conjecture I made would I have no 
<lb/>doubt before this been verified. My going to 
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> is however against the realiszation 
<lb/>of their hopes. You will have seen by his note 
<lb/>which I sent by <persName>Boe</persName> that had he known 
<lb/>of my intention fo have another station 
<lb/>he would have waived all this "row" he would 
<lb/>not have cried &amp; groaned before you not he 
<lb/>had he only known that the "nonentity" 
<lb/>would probably withdraw himself from 
<lb/>the immediate vicinity of his supreme importance 
<lb/><persName>Pilanie</persName> seems to think him as much a nonentity 
<lb/>as I am for in his recent visit 

	

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000589_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/><persName>Pilanie</persName> went out of his way But let it be known 
<lb/>that he thinks him "a child of <persName>Mosielele</persName>" <persName>Pilanie</persName> said 
<lb/>in his last visit to <persName>Mosilele</persName>, <persName>Edwards O'mpehile</persName> from
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="und">beha; Ã±uana oa</foreign><persName>Mosielele</persName> hela eo. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName> gave him 
<lb/>a present when here. I gave him nothing -- If he of 
<lb/>importance is so much esteemed, what must I be? 
<lb/>I think I did not tell you of the grand conference 
<lb/>of Kings once projected to take place at <placeName><settlement type="village">Motito</settlement></placeName>. 
<lb/><persName>Sebegoe</persName><persName>Moiloe</persName><persName>Mokhatla</persName><persName>Mahura</persName><persName>Andries</persName> &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c 
<lb/>were all to be there. <persName>Sebegoe</persName> was sent for  <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">here</add> and 
<lb/>urged to go. He thought <persName>Edwards</persName> wanted to betray him 
<lb/>I was sent for &amp; found the poor man did not 
<lb/>know what to make of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName>'s earnest entreaties 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName> thoight I would assist him, I unfortunately 
<lb/>expressed a doubt about the safety of <persName>Sebegoe</persName>
<lb/>putting himself into some of their hands and the 
<lb/>famous congress was knocked on the head 
<lb/><persName>Sebegoe</persName> said he would go if I would take 
<lb/>him but I did not feel inclined to interfere 
<lb/>in kingly affairs. I dont remember that you 
<lb/>were to <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">be</add> one of the party but <persName>Ross</persName>, <persName>Helmore</persName> &amp;c 
<lb/>certainly were. I think of it now as if it 
<lb/>would have been very fine -- I now hear 
<lb/>the car passing the window, but we dont 
<lb/>send letters by him.</p>


	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000589_0006"><!--pb/@n='3v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>I have taken out two door frames, &amp; two of the 
<lb/>window frames I intend to take <hi rend="sup">also</hi>. If this house is 
<lb/>made a meeting house of it will not need the 
<lb/>door frames and if he makes it a dwelling house 
<lb/>he <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName> can make others more easily than I 
<lb/>I dont think spite will allow him to do anything 
<lb/>with it. If the inside walls were removed it would 
<lb/>make a much better church than that at <placeName><settlement type="village">Motito</settlement></placeName>
<lb/><persName>Mebaloe</persName> goes with us. I said not a word to him 
<lb/>but when digging up the trees he came &amp; asked if 
<lb/>I should help him by taking his. I replied that 
<lb/>though I contemplated removal I had not thought 
<lb/>of requesting him to move, I had wished to get 
<lb/>another to go forward with me. To this he requested 
<lb/>if I had any fault to find with him not to hide it 
<lb/>and on my saying I had no fault but supposed 
<lb/>as he had at great expense cleared out all the 
<lb/>roots out of a fine garden, built a good house, &amp;c 
<lb/>I thought he would prefer to remain and another could go 
<lb/>with me as assistant, he then entreated me to 
<lb/>allow him to go forward &amp; let the other of whom 
<lb/>I spoke remain here &amp; take his place. To even 
<lb/>this I would have objected had <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName> not 
<lb/>in his letter to the Directors quite discarded him</p>
<lb/><p>The chief made many objections and it was with 
<lb/>great difficulty I could remove the impression 

	

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000589_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/>that I had some cause of dissatisfaction either in him or 
<lb/>people. Had any one stolen anything? He would give 
<lb/>orders immediately that no one should from that day 
<lb/>forward beg. If any one had vexed us Tell who it is &amp; 
<lb/>I shall punish him. Were we tired because the hearts 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> were hard he explained that the 
<lb/>hearts of all <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> were so &amp; he could observe 
<lb/>they were just about to begin <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">to</add> give way to the preaching 
<lb/>of the word. If any one wished to believe he was 
<lb/>at liberty to change his customs &amp;c. I tried to persuade 
<lb/>him that I was not in the least dissatisfied with 
<lb/>either him or his people. I promised to mend his 
<lb/>gun for him where I was in future as if I were living 
<lb/>with him, &amp;c. but they all say "Loa re latla" 
<lb/>I did not expect they would have <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> 
<lb/>anything like the concern for our leaving 
<lb/>which they do. It made me sorry for there 
<lb/>are many of the younger men who seem to 
<lb/>have affection for us and I suppose that 
<lb/>affection might have been the means of 
<lb/>leading them to the Saviour. I hope they 
<lb/>may be converted although not by our <w>instrumen<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-tality</w></p>
<lb/><p>We have sown a great many garden seeds 
<lb/>presented to us by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>Methuen</persName>. The endive 
<lb/>spin<supplied cert="high">a</supplied>ch, turnip, marigold wurzel &amp; Knights early 
<lb/>cabbage have come through the ground 

	

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000589_0008"><!--pb/@n='4v'--></pb>
<lb/>also so lettuces &amp; carrots, so we shall have vegetables 
<lb/>I have got three large Swedish turnips - intend them 
<lb/>for seed. None of our onions have come up, the 
<lb/>seed seems bad. I am very sorry the olive is 
<lb/>dead but there is hope in the roots. There are 
<lb/>wild olives at the bottom of our garden at 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName>. The soil is black deposit 
<lb/>with at some parts small portions of limestone 
<lb/>intermixed. The banks of the stream are clayey 
<lb/>the water is small but it will serve. The 
<lb/>prospect of success in the great object of 
<lb/>our mission is greater there than here. The 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> are not so degraded as we found 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>. The people there all profess 
<lb/>to be highly pleased with the prospect of 
<lb/>our residence among them. <persName>Sechele</persName> is 
<lb/>building a wall round his town, it contains 
<lb/>loopholes for shooting. The shape of the 
<lb/>whole is a sort of triangle and the base line 
<lb/>is longer than the wall in front of both 
<lb/>gardens at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName></p>
<lb/><p>From what I have said of our plans 
<lb/>you will understand that we cannot come 
<lb/>to a committee till February. I suppose the 
<lb/><choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> will make some allowances for 
<lb/>our convenience as well as for <persName><choice><abbr>Mrs</abbr><expan>Misses</expan></choice><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan><supplied cert="high">Edwards</supplied></expan></choice></persName>'s</p>
