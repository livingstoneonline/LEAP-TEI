<lb/><p rend="left">(IV.)</p>
<lb/><p rend="center">Statement </p>
<lb/><p rend="left"><choice><reg>R</reg><orig>r</orig></choice>especting a turning lathe furnished by 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> John Laird</persName> to the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> Expedition<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The Engineer of the Expedition 
<lb/>having been ordered to see that every 
<lb/>necessary tool was supplied mentioned 
<lb/>a turning lathe as part of the usual 
<lb/>equipment - and as he understood 
<lb/>one was ordered from Whitworth's 
<lb/><placeName>Manchester</placeName> at a cost of £53 - 
<lb/>but some delay occurring in the 
<lb/>delivery at <placeName>Birkenhead</placeName>, <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird </persName>
<lb/>proposed to substitute an old one 
<lb/>from his shop, and the naval 
<lb/>officer in charge professed 
<w>willing-<lb break="no"/>ness</w> to accede to this proposal. 
<lb/>But <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> refused his consent 
<lb/>saying that "as a new article 
<lb/>was to be paid for, it would be 
<lb/>as well for us to get the new 
<lb/>thing." We left under the 
<lb/>conviction that the new lathe 
<lb/>was supplied, as the new 
<lb/>price (£53) was paid; but 
<lb/>on opening the box at <placeName>Tette</placeName>, 
<lb/>which had never been disturbed 
<lb/>from our leaving <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>
<lb/>we found that the bolts inside 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001513_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>which held the machine had been unscrewed 
<lb/>though furnished with double nuts. Some 
<lb/>old parts of a turning lathe substituted 
<lb/>for new ones - and <hi rend="underline">not a single 
<lb/>tool left</hi> in the box. Important parts 
<lb/>of the machine were also abstracted &amp; 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> has been obliged to make them 
<lb/>the N<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi> on the old parts substituted 
<lb/>being "56" from an old established 
<lb/>house, is proof of the swindling; and 
<lb/>affords a cue which might be traced 
<lb/>were the proposal made &amp; agreed to 
<lb/>by <persName>Commander Bedingfeld</persName> &amp; refused 
<lb/>by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> not sufficient to point 
<lb/>the delinquent. </p>
<lb/><p>I make this statement not from 
<lb/>any wish to injure <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird</persName>, but from 
<lb/>a natural desire to prevent the 
<w>Govern-<lb break="no"/>ment,</w> with which I have the honour 
<lb/>to be connected, being again stultified - 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">and</del> its operations retarded - and possibly 
<lb/>public blame attached, by similar 
<lb/>frauds. </p>

<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> shewed <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> that she was then drawing 19 inches 
<lb/>and when weight equal to that of the house was put in she drew 25 inches 
<lb/>yet <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> reported her to be " just the thing we required."</p><anchor xml:id="p3-01"/>
<lb/><p>The cylinder is unquestionably 
<lb/>a low pressure one applied to high 
<lb/>pressure purposes. The projecting 
<lb/>portion in the middle of the cylinder 
<lb/>of which I shall endeavour 
<lb/>to send you a photograph proceed 
<lb/>it at a glance - and a corresponding 
<lb/>hollow inside cannot be explained 
<lb/>on any other idea<reg>.</reg> It is quite evident 
<lb/>that we were furnished at an exhorbitant 
<lb/>price with the sweepings of the shop. </p>
<lb/><p>For a considerable time after 
<lb/>the fire is lighted the water on one 
<lb/>side remains cold - and by opening 
<lb/>a cock on that side the hand may 
<lb/>be held in it while the other side 
<lb/>is too hot to be endured. Until 
<lb/>steam is generated one side remains 
<lb/>comparatively cold. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he vessel is altogether an ill 
<lb/>planned affair. She drew more than 
<lb/>18 inches at her first trial in the 
<lb/>Mersey. We shall make the most 
<lb/>of a bad &amp; shabby bargain, but 
<lb/>it is mortifying to be obliged to spend 
<lb/>precious time which otherwise 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001513_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>would have been devoted to the exploration 
<lb/>&amp; civilisation of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, in tinkering 
<lb/>a vessel - a mere punt - for which 
<lb/>we paid such an enormous price - 
<lb/>£1200 (extras all paid for besides) 
<lb/>was pretty fair for 12 months very 
<lb/>slow work with-out any whine 
<lb/>of "doing it all for the good of the 
<lb/>cause." If I ever hear the phrase 
<lb/>after this, I shall ask if the "cause" 
<lb/>at the bankers is meant or what. </p>
<lb/><p>It occurs to me that it will be well to add 
<lb/>the irrelevant sentence I left out in another 
<lb/>sheet<reg>.</reg> It is. </p>
<lb/><p>"I have not seen <persName>Baikie's</persName> official report 
<lb/>to <persName>Lord Clarendon</persName>, but in his letter to me 
<lb/>describing the accident to the Dayspring 
<lb/>it seems have arised from the Bow 
<lb/>being in one current and the Stern in another 
<lb/>in consequence the vessel would not answer 
<lb/>her helm - she was in fact ascending a rapid 
<lb/>without a steadying line to the shore - which 
<lb/>in the <placeName>Nile</placeName> - <placeName>Indus</placeName> - &amp; <placeName>Euphrates</placeName> has always 
<lb/>been found necessary" - With this sentence 
<lb/>you have the entire note of 16 Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 58<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The compartments joined by <persName>Laird's</persName> plan 
<lb/>become force pumps as soon as the pins 
<lb/>below wear a little <figure><!--<graphic url="LETT1059-1.png"/>--></figure> The motion of the vessel 
<lb/>brings the comp<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> together below with a jerk &amp; the 
<lb/>water is forced out on all sides &amp; above. No caulking 
<lb/>can prevent it. This is the reason of our being always wet<reg>.</reg></p>
