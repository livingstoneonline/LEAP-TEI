<lb/><p rend="left">Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>The water in the river having 
<lb/>been lower than ever known by the 
<lb/>oldest people, we could examine the 
<lb/><placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName> with ease: people 
<lb/>could even wade from the North 
<lb/>bank to the garden island and we 
<lb/>could see well to the bottom. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>depth is 310 feet sheer down 
<lb/>probably a few feet more as the 
<lb/>weight on the line rested on a slope 
<lb/>near the bottom. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he breadth from 
<lb/>bank to bank is not a thousand 
<lb/>yards as I conjectured but between 
<lb/>one statute &amp; one geographical 
<lb/>mile, we say 1860 yards though 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001593_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>it is little more by way of assisting 
<lb/>the memory. We measured with a 
<lb/>tape line &amp; allowed 2 feet in every 
<lb/>67 feet for slack &amp; curvature. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen 
<lb/>even at low water there were 800 feet 
<lb/>of water falling. I measured the 
<lb/>width of the fizzure at the island in 
<lb/>the middle with the sextant and got 
<lb/>80 feet but this is doubtful as we 
<lb/>could not throw a stone across<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Looking from above it is the 
<lb/>shape of the letter <del type="strikethrough"><hi rend="italic">L</hi></del><hi rend="other">L</hi> but 
<lb/>the crack of the most <figure><!--<graphic url="LETT1139-1.gif"/>--><figDesc/></figure> wonderful 
<lb/>zigzag shape ever seen. Fancy 
<lb/>this rude sketch all of one 
<lb/>level except the bottom of the 
<lb/>crack which is 300 feet below<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001593_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/><figure><graphic style="float:left" url="LETT1139-2.gif"/><figDesc/></figure> The dotted line shews the 
<lb/>course of the water after 
<lb/>it has fallen down to 
<lb/>be from both sides 
<lb/>to the prolongation 
<lb/>of the crack. There 
<lb/>is but 400 <unclear cert="low">paces</unclear>
<lb/>between the fall &amp; 
<lb/>the first elbow made by the 
<lb/>Fizzure and all the land 
<lb/>formed by the zigzags into 
<lb/>promontories is of the 
<lb/>same level as the bed of 
<lb/>the river above the falls<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>You walk along and see the 
<lb/>river deep down on each 
<lb/>side of you and at least 
<lb/>300 feet <del type="strikethrough">down</del> below. It is 
<lb/>really the most wonderful 
<lb/>affair in waterfalls in the world<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001593_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>We could not visit <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>
<lb/>and arrange matters about our 
<lb/>post. We could not leave <persName>Sekeletu</persName>
<lb/>so soon as we wished on account 
<lb/>of his disease - then the Elephant 
<lb/>hunters whom we met at the Falls 
<lb/>had unfortunately departed before 
<lb/>we got our Despatches written<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The heat became excessive too<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>At <placeName>Sinamanés</placeName> the soil was 
<lb/>136º at 3PM. not a single shower 
<lb/>had fallen and the country had 
<lb/>suffered one of its periodical 
<lb/>droughts. A thermometer held 
<lb/>in the shade of the body &amp; 3 feet 
<lb/>above the soil was 102º at that 
<lb/>hour and during a march 
<lb/>our blood even became 1 1/2º hotter than that of the natives or <del type="strikethrough">99</del>.5 
<lb/>or 99.5º <reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001593_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'--> 
<lb/>We could not moreover have 
<lb/>made a decent visit as to time 
<lb/>without breaking entirely our 
<lb/>promise to be at <placeName>Kongone</placeName> at 
<lb/>the end of this month. But we 
<lb/>got to the head man at the falls who 
<lb/>had always treated the Matibele 
<lb/>of <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> who came with 
<lb/>the letters in a scurvy manner 
<lb/>removed to another part &amp; orders given to his sucessor 
<lb/>to treat &amp; feed them well. Letters 
<lb/>were waiting for me at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> John Moffat</persName> is now with 
<lb/><persName>Mosilikatze</persName> and in time matters 
<lb/>will be arranged. </p>
<lb/><p>I have not by an<reg>y</reg> means 
<lb/>given up hope in the Makololo<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001593_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'--> 
<lb/>The delay caused by failure to 
<lb/>ascend at once to them has 
<lb/>led to opening a new field of 
<lb/>perhaps still greater importance 
<lb/>in reference to the slave trade<reg>.</reg> I have no doubt as to being 
<lb/>able to ascend in flood. We 
<lb/>saw the whole river in our canoes 
<lb/>from <placeName>Sinamanés</placeName> downwards 
<lb/>many rapids were developed 
<lb/>below <placeName>Chicova</placeName> by excessive low 
<lb/>water which were under 4 knots 
<lb/>when we ascended - the most 
<lb/>rapid part we saw was scarcely 
<lb/>six knots - <placeName>Morumbua</placeName> is a 
<lb/>sloping cataract at low water 
<lb/>and the water may come down 
<lb/>in the space of 30 or 40 yards 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001593_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'--> 
<lb/>20 or 30 feet but the rise 
<lb/>there is 80 feet and the flood 
<lb/>will certainly smooth the cataract 
<lb/>over. <placeName>Chicova</placeName> seen from 
<lb/>the land looked like a basaltic 
<lb/>dyke across the stream but 
<lb/>we passed through it in the canoes 
<lb/>without observing it in coming 
<lb/>down. There is a large seam 
<lb/>of coal in the bank there from 
<lb/>which steamers will one day 
<lb/>lead. There is another seam 
<lb/>in the bank at<placeName>Manyerive hill</placeName>
<lb/>and the coal field extends up 
<lb/>near to <placeName>Sinamanés</placeName>. The 
<lb/>part of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> between 
<lb/><placeName>Sinamanés</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Kansalo</placeName> is 
<lb/>the deepest &amp; most navigable 
<lb/>of it all and <placeName>Kansalo</placeName> has 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001593_0008"/><!--pb/@n='8'--> 
<lb/><choice><sic>has</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> nothing formidable in it 
<lb/>except to canoes whose gunwale 
<lb/>is scarcely 6 inches above the 
<lb/>water. </p>
<lb/><p>I thank you for all your notes 
<lb/>which came now in a heap, &amp; 
<lb/>for all you have done to aid us 
<lb/>most heartily. I am really 
<w>un-<lb break="no"/>feignedly</w> thankful. It was very 
<lb/>kind in you to dissuade <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi>
<lb/>L.</persName> from coming, and I sincerely 
<lb/>hope she acceded to your most 
<lb/>proper advice. The Makololo 
<lb/>are excessively anxious to have 
<lb/>her but until more progress is 
<lb/>made she would be in the way. 
<lb/>I have 16 of them here though I wished 
<lb/>but 10. It is arranged that as soon 
<lb/>as we get up to <placeName>Kafue</placeName> all remove to us<reg>.</reg></p>
