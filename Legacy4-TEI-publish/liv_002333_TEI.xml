<lb/>1865 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Kirk</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I took a run over 
<lb/>to <persName>Young<reg>'</reg>s</persName> a week ago 
<lb/>and thence went to 
<lb/><placeName>Edinburgh</placeName> to talk to 
<lb/><persName>Lord Dalhousie</persName>
<lb/>but was unfortunate 
<lb/>enough to find him 
<lb/>at the Assembly on 
<lb/>the last day of meeting. 
<lb/>When that was over 
<lb/>I was too fatigued 
<lb/>with padding about 
<lb/>to feel that I could 
<lb/>appear to advantage 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002333_0002"/><!--pb/@n='28v'-->
<lb/>and it was too late 
<lb/>for a call besides - I 
<lb/>had to come away here 
<lb/>for I had promised 
<lb/>to come back. My 
<lb/>mother being very 
<lb/>far gone, I fear sinking 
<lb/>gradually - and not 
<lb/>long for this world. 
<lb/>She had Bronchitis. 
<lb/>The lower part of the 
<lb/>lungs seems to be 
<lb/>impervious. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd 
<lb/>she feels as if choking<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>At her age, 82, no 
<lb/>hope of recovery can 
<lb/>be entertained. I have 
<lb/>got <persName>Stewart</persName> to make enquiries as to <persName>Lord 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002333_0003"/><!--pb/@n='29r'-->
<lb/>Dalhousies's</persName> whereabouts 
<lb/>without saying what 
<lb/>my object is, and 
<lb/>if I can leave my 
<lb/>poor mother will 
<lb/>make a journey to 
<lb/>where he may be<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I was just an afternoon 
<lb/>&amp; morning at 
<lb/><persName>Young<reg>'</reg>s</persName>, and did not 
<lb/>see your brother or 
<lb/>the new works. </p>
<lb/><p>I have written to 
<lb/><persName>Sunley</persName> for Johanna 
<lb/>men. It does not 
<lb/>seem feasible to go 
<lb/>into <placeName>Mombassa</placeName> &amp;
hand oneself &amp; goods 
<lb/>over to people of 
<lb/>whom we know next 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002333_0004"/><!--pb/@n='29v'-->
<lb/>to nothing &amp; on whom 
<lb/>we have no hold. I may 
<lb/>get a few of some other 
<lb/>tribe of Indians from 
<lb/><persName>Sir Bartle Frere</persName> as a 
<lb/>body guard. He is a 
<lb/>very able man without 
<lb/>doubt, and has worked 
<lb/>himself up by sheer 
<lb/>ability alone - so 
<w>not-<lb break="no"/>withstanding</w> anything 
<lb/>to the contrary, I think 
<lb/>there will be no mistake 
<lb/>in placing some reliance 
<lb/>on him. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>Tom's</persName> complaint 
<lb/>comes back if he 
<lb/>overexerts himself, 
<lb/>which from feeling 
<lb/>hearty &amp; strong he is 
<lb/>rather induced to do, or 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_002333_0005"/><!--pb/@n='30r'-->
<lb/>if he gets cold. He has 
<lb/>grown a great deal 
<lb/>&amp; is growing fast. 
<lb/>He got a prize for 
<lb/>drawing yesterday. 
<lb/>The picture was 
<lb/>exhibited, and is very 
<lb/>much better than I 
<lb/>had any idea of. He 
<lb/>must be taking 
<lb/>after his father! who 
<lb/>is great in that line!! 
<lb/><persName>Oswell</persName> got prizes 
<lb/>for being dux in 
<lb/>six departments - 
<lb/>yesterday I went to 
<lb/>see the distribution.

<lb/>French &amp; Latin &amp;<reg>.</reg> The 
<lb/>recitations in German 
<lb/>&amp; English far exceeded 
<lb/>anything I ever saw 
<lb/>when I was a boy. 
<lb/>We hear nothing of poor 
<lb/><persName>Bob</persName> &amp; I fear never 
<lb/>will. I think that 
<lb/>it cannot be denied 
<lb/>that the confederates 
<lb/>treated their prisioners 
<lb/>cruelly. They had not 
<lb/>rations enough for 
<lb/>their soldiers, and we 
<lb/>cannot wonder that 
<lb/>they starved their prisioners. It would be 
<lb/>a pity if they hung 
<lb/><persName>Davis</persName>, but I cannot 
<lb/><choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> why he 
<lb/>is so lauded as a

<lb/>He fought that he &amp; others 
<lb/>might be served with 
<w>-<lb break="no"/>out</w>
<lb/>paying servants 
<lb/>wages. We don<reg>'</reg>t call a 
<lb/>man a gentleman 
<lb/>who can't &amp; won<reg>'</reg>t pay 
<lb/>his way. The South 
<lb/>has a gigantic task now 
<lb/>in undoing all that 
<lb/>slavery has done in 
<lb/>debasing these millions 
<lb/>of negroes. Of course 
<lb/>they won<reg>'</reg>t work now 
<lb/>nor should I if I had 
<lb/>been a slave. </p>
<lb/><p>I got my evidence 
<lb/>to correct but had 
<lb/>already corrected it 
<lb/>in a copy of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Arthur 
<lb/>Mills </persName> &amp; trusted him

<lb/>he has forgotten &amp; it 
<lb/>will go uncorrected 
<lb/>with several mistakes 
<lb/>in it which I regret 
<lb/>but I recommended 
<lb/>the keeping up the

<lb/>Do they mean to hold

<lb/>that is a mistake 
<lb/>A strong middle class
