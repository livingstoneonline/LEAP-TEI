<lb/>with her Saviour and possibly

<lb/>without the aid of letters. I 
<lb/>see that you remember the

<lb/>as often as you can I shall 
<lb/>send you as much in 
<lb/>return as all you write. I 
<lb/>thank you for your kind 
<lb/>birthday present and for all 
<lb/>your good wishes. I have 
<lb/>sent some little things in 
<lb/>a box which will be opened 
<lb/>by <persName>Sir William Hooker</persName> at 
<lb/><placeName>Kew</placeName> and the packet sent

<lb/><p>We are now at sea in the 
<lb/><placeName><choice><reg>Mozambique</reg><orig>Mosambique</orig></choice> channel</placeName> going to 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna</placeName> and the <placeName>River 
<lb/>Rovuma</placeName>. We steamed off 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone</placeName> to get away well from 
<lb/>the land then our wood being 
<lb/>but small we set sail, and 
<lb/>kept the fuel for worse times 
<lb/>but the wind was against 
<lb/>us or from the North East. 
<lb/>If we went one way we 
<lb/>should have gone into <placeName>Quillimane</placeName>
<lb/>so we went the other and 
<lb/>were fain to go away far to 
<lb/>the South East. When about 
<lb/>mid channel we had a fine 
<lb/>breeze from the south and 
<lb/>went as we thought sixty miles 
<lb/>to the North but next day we 
<lb/>found by the sun &amp; chronometers

<lb/>that while sailing briskly in one 
<lb/>way the current in the sea had 
<lb/>been taking us faster in another<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We were twelve miles South West 
<lb/>of where we had been the day 
<lb/>before when the wind began to 
<lb/>blow from the South. Indeed the 
<lb/>current had been flowing at the rate 
<lb/>of 72 miles a day. Last year 
<lb/>we met an East Indian ship 
<lb/>near the same spot which was 
<lb/>carried by the same current 
<lb/>40 miles a day. We were then 
<lb/>becalmed and knowing <del type="strikethrough">that</del>
<lb/>though we could see nothing 
<lb/>that we were still gliding away 
<lb/>where we did not wish to go. 
<lb/>We got up steam and steamed 
<lb/>East till we knew we had 
<lb/>crossed the current. We have 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001816_0005"/><!--pb/@n='104r'-->
<lb/>had a good deal of calms, and only 
<lb/>when we got near the coast of 
<lb/><placeName>Madagascar</placeName> did we meet favourable 
<lb/>winds. <choice><reg>I</reg><orig>i</orig></choice>f you look at the map 
<lb/>you may see a small island called 
<lb/><placeName>Ja√µ de Nova</placeName> we went between 
<lb/>that and <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>. <choice><reg>W</reg><orig>w</orig></choice>e saw 
<lb/>neither the island nor <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>
<lb/>but by sextant &amp; chronometers 
<lb/>I guided our ship through that 
<lb/>way to avoid the current further 
<lb/>out. We went 120 miles yesterday 
<lb/>and should we have wind 
<lb/>will see <placeName>Johanna</placeName> tomorrow 
<lb/>afternoon. Now you see it is 
<lb/>a good thing to possess knowledge<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I never intended to navigate 
<lb/>a ship but now that it has 
<lb/>come in my way, I do it &amp; 
<lb/>am thankful that I picked up

<lb/>when younger all the knowledge 
<lb/>I could. You must do the same. 
<lb/>It is easy to carry about with 
<lb/>you though you may not use 
<lb/>it. I wished to give <persName>Robert</persName> a 
<lb/>good education as the best legacy 
<lb/>I could leave him. I know it 
<lb/>would be useful - but he does 
<lb/>not appreciate it. At present 
<lb/>when young, people will pay 
<lb/>attention to him on my account, 
<lb/>but when they see that he has 
<lb/>nothing in him he will be 
<lb/>despised, and will be fit only 
<lb/>to drive a "cuddy and a cart" with 
<lb/>greens or clay pipes. I am sorry 
<lb/>for it but the loss will be 
<lb/>his. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd it will be yours if

<lb/>your own attainments and

<lb/>a good education to fit you for

<lb/>Wherefore is there a price in the

<lb/>seeing he hath no heart to it,
