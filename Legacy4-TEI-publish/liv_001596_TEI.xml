<lb/><p><placeName>Tette</placeName> 28<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> 1860 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Tom 
<lb/>Having visited the <placeName>Makololo 
<lb/>Country</placeName> lately I saw <persName>Secpone</persName> and <persName>Marike</persName>
<lb/>two women formerly the wives of <persName>Sebituane</persName>
<lb/>who used to feed you with honey &amp; milk<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>They brought back to my recollection the time 
<lb/>when you were with us at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> and 
<lb/>many other things by what is called the 
<lb/>association of ideas. You will notice 
<lb/>sometimes ideas spring up in the mind 
<lb/>which you do not want there - one has no 
<lb/>power to prevent that but we have 
<lb/>power to change the current of our thoughts 
<lb/>to something else, and we are commanded 
<lb/>to think of whatsoever is pure &amp; good 
<lb/>&amp; lovely &amp;c. Watch your heart and remember 
<lb/>that the Lord sees it. </p>
<lb/><p>In the last six months we have travelled 
<lb/>about 1400 miles partly on foot &amp; partly 
<lb/>in canoes. We found <persName>Sekeletu</persName> labouring  
<lb/>under a skin disease which is believed 
<lb/>to be leprosy and as it was believed 
<lb/>also to be the effect of witchcraft 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001596_0002"/><!--pb/@n='109r'--> 
<lb/>several very influential men were put to death 
<lb/>for the crime. We tried to cure it and were 
<lb/>succeeding when obliged to leave. Of course 
<lb/>we told him we didn<reg>'</reg>t believe a word 
<lb/>of the witchcraft but unfortunately the 
<lb/>persons put to death were the sons of 
<lb/>certain chiefs who tried to kill <persName>Sebituane</persName>
<lb/>and it was believed that the children 
<lb/>wished to secure the chieftainship by 
<lb/>the same means their fathers failed in. 
<lb/>The <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> are perishing - the fever affects 
<lb/>them as well as Europeans and all 
<lb/>are very anxious that we should come 
<lb/>and live with them - for then they could 
<lb/>remove to the Highlands. We went up 
<lb/>to a part of them near <placeName>Tabacheu</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>saw hoar frost and a little ice in a 
<lb/>valley. Down in the valley of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>it was roasting - the ground 137째 Fah<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
<lb/>and the thermometer in the hand &amp; shaded 
<lb/>102째. We used to sleep at the brink of the 
<lb/>river because there it was cooler - the 
<lb/>water was 84째 or 86째<reg>.</reg> We are now on 
<lb/>our way down to the sea to meet a ship<reg>.</reg>
