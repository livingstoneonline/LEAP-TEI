<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p><placeName>River Shire, Eastern Africa</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>26 October 1859</p>
<lb/><p>My dear <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> Archer</persName>
<lb/>I suppose there is no 
<lb/>use in beginning apologies &amp; explanations 
<lb/>to you my dear friends for my long 
<lb/>silence. It has troubled me more than it 
<lb/>can have done you for again &amp; again 
<lb/>have I remembered your disinterested 
<lb/>kindness to me &amp; mine and felt 
<lb/>ashamed that I had never once given 
<lb/>you the poor acknowledgement of 
<lb/>a letter. I do not think that a hundred 
<lb/>would wipe out the sense of obligation 
<lb/>I feel, nor do I desire to feel it less 
<lb/>but there is a pleasure in letting one 
<lb/>know that his goodness was appreciated 
<lb/>and freeing oneself as far as may 
<lb/>be from the the knotless thread character. 
<lb/>Blessing be to you and <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> A</persName>
<lb/>for your manifold kindnesses. </p>
<lb/><p>We have not been idle since 
<lb/>we came here, and with a thankful 
<lb/>heart to our Father above we have 
<lb/>to say that his kind Providence 
<lb/>has watched over and prospered 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001493_0002"/><!--pb/@n='52v'--> 
<lb/>us at every turn of our path. Even 
<lb/>circumstances which at first seemed 
<lb/>very untoward have turned out signally 
<lb/>for the best. It would have been a long story 
<lb/>to tell you all so I begin at our latest 
<lb/>feat namely, tracing this river up to 
<lb/>its point of emergence from the hitherto 
<lb/>undiscovered <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> or <placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName>
<lb/>this is a direction in which we had no 
<lb/>previous intention of travelling and the 
<lb/>result is the discovery of a cotton 
<lb/>producing region in every respect 
<lb/>superior to the American. There are no 
<lb/>frosts to endanger or cut off the crops 
<lb/>and instead of the enormous toil required 
<lb/>to raise the plant in <placeName>America</placeName> - one 
<lb/>sowing serves for three years crops 
<lb/>even though the plants may be burned 
<lb/>down. The land above the cataracts is 
<lb/>high and disposed in three terraces 
<lb/>of 1200 feet 2000 feet &amp; 3000 feet 
<lb/>respectively. We have as we experienced 
<lb/>changes of climate within a few miles 
<lb/>distance of each of them. The terraces are 
<lb/>well supplied with running rills of 
<lb/>deliciously cool water - &amp; cotton is grown 
<lb/>over them all. On the last terrace 
<lb/>rises <placeName>Mount Zomba</placeName> between 7000 &amp; 
<lb/>8000 feet high &amp; cultivated on the top<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>Fancy Benledi on the top of Benlomond 
<lb/>and a fine river running in a valley 
<lb/>on its great top some 15 or 20 miles 
<lb/>broad. I want the church missionary 
<lb/>society to occupy this field. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey have 
<lb/>long been trying to get into Eastern 
<lb/>Africa. <placeName>The Shire</placeName>is easily navigable 
<lb/>for 100 miles from the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. Then 
<lb/>33 miles of cataracts &amp; then an immense 
<lb/>field watered by the lakes. <placeName>Tamandua</placeName>
<lb/>we measured at 90 miles long but 
<lb/>no one could say how far away 
<lb/>the head of <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> lay. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey can come 
<lb/>into this field aye. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat is if they 
<lb/>have the pluck &amp; be at once away 
<lb/>from the unfriendly coast tribes. The 
<lb/>good land by all will assurdedly 
<lb/>occupy it by some agency or other 
<lb/>for it has advantages for which I have 
<lb/>not paper to tell. Some of our friends 
<lb/>on hearing of this discovery will think 
<lb/>that I am now seeking the glory alone 
<lb/>of discovering Lakes Mountains - 
<w>Jenny-<lb break="no"/>nettles</w> and <unclear cert="low">guddock</unclear> stools - others will 
<lb/>see at a glance whether my efforts tend and perhaps it may be permitted 
<lb/>to me to do some little to relieve our 
<lb/>countrymen from the stain of upholding 
<lb/>slavery by manufacturing the produce 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001493_0004"/><!--pb/@n='53v'--> 
<lb/>of slave labour alone. At any rate I shall 
<lb/>work while life lasts for noble &amp; 
<lb/>christlike ends. </p>
<lb/><p>Singularly enough we have been 
<lb/>without news from home since we 
<lb/>left. Except a few newspapers 
<lb/><gap extent="5" unit="words" agent="illegible"/> our 
<lb/>Government despatches which have 
<lb/>come with great regularity we have 
<lb/>no private information as to how 
<lb/>the <unclear cert="low">wold ways</unclear>. A day or two ago 
<lb/>however we heard by a man kindly 
<lb/>sent by a Portuguese gentleman of 
<lb/><placeName>Senna</placeName> that a bag awaits us there<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>My wife was some time ago at 
<lb/><placeName>Kuruman.</placeName> We expect to ascend to the <placeName>Makololo Country</placeName> in the beginning 
<lb/>of next year. Hope the London Missionary 
<lb/>Society has sent men to that interesting 
<lb/>field and that the men have had the 
<lb/>sense to occupy it. When does the 
<lb/>Free Kirk and your Kirk write? 
<lb/>Must death still clear the way? What 
<lb/>a powerful body for good you will 
<lb/>make. May the Master <unclear cert="low">pasted</unclear> it. 
<lb/>My kindest salutations to <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> A</persName> &amp; 
<lb/>Blessing be on your house &amp; church </p>

This is written in a marsh with millions of mosquitoes  about. Before

This is a spendid sanatatorium, and one of the great benefits the
