<lb/><p rend="right">River Zambesi</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">21<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> March 1860.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>My Lord Bishop</persName></p>
<lb/><p>In a speech delivered 
<lb/>at Manchester about a year ago, 
<lb/>I found, for the first time a 
<lb/>few days since, the very cheering 
<lb/>intimation that <persName>Miss Coutts</persName> had 
<lb/>subscribed Â£2500 towards an 
<lb/>institution for the sons of 
<lb/>native chiefs. As you have no 
<lb/>doubt been generously supported 
<lb/>in the noble undertaking by 
<lb/>other members of the English 
<lb/>church, and cannot fail to be, 
<lb/>by the Divine blessing, extensively 
<lb/>useful, I take the liberty to 
<lb/>congratulate you on the enterprise. 
<lb/>Feeling a deep interest in any 
<lb/>plan for the elevation of the 
<lb/>population of this country, 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001550_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>whether white or black, I may 
<lb/>be allowed to shew my sympathy 
<lb/>with yours by alluding to the 
<lb/>extensive field which in the 
<lb/>course of time your benevolence 
<lb/>will affect.</p>
<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Kaffre</term> or <term type="tribe">Zulu</term> family 
<lb/>extends right up to the Zambesi. 
<lb/>Under the name "<term type="tribe"><unclear cert="low">Landims</unclear></term>" 
<lb/>(<term type="tribe">Landeens</term>) they have conquered 
<lb/>all the gold region called 
<lb/><placeName>Manica</placeName>, and all the south 
<lb/>bank of this river (except the 
<lb/>lands in the immediate 
<lb/>vicinity of the forts <placeName>Senna </placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Tette</placeName>) is under their 
<lb/>sway or depopulated. </p>
<lb/><p>The estate of <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>which, yielding the immense 
<lb/>trees used in forming the 
<lb/>large canoes common on 
<lb/>the Zambesi, cannot be 
<lb/>dispensed with by the 
<lb/>Portuguese, is retained only 
<lb/>by paying a large <add place="above">annual</add> tribute.</p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001550_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/><p>Some 600 dollars are paid to the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Landeens</term>, and only 400 of rent 
<lb/>to the Portuguese Government. 
<lb/>The language is nearly identical 
<lb/>with that of the <term type="tribe">Zulus</term> of 
<lb/>Natal and <term type="tribe">Moenekhosi</term> or 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Manikhosi</term>. (the "Manicus" of the Boers) <add place="marginleft">the paramount 
<lb/>chief of the 
<lb/>whole region 
<lb/>north of 
<lb/><placeName>Inhambane</placeName>, </add>is of the same family 
<lb/>as <term type="tribe">Panda</term>. They all have 
<lb/>a certain amount of respect 
<lb/>for the English or as they 
<lb/>call us Maingeretse. When 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> visited a village 
<lb/>subject to their sway, his 
<lb/>wants were abundantly 
<lb/>supplied, and payment 
<lb/>refused: Your efforts and 
<lb/>those of other bodies of Christians 
<lb/>among these fine people 
<lb/>will without doubt be one day 
<lb/>crowned with glorious results.</p>
<lb/><p>If we turn to the influences 
<lb/>at work hitherto in this region 
<lb/>we see abundant reason for joy 
<lb/>at the prospect of the introduction 
<lb/>of better agencies. We have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>much kindness from individual 
<lb/>Portuguese, and can therefore 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001550_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>speak confidentially only about 
<lb/>their system. Their establishments 
<lb/>are not colonies, but small penal 
<lb/>settlements. No women are sent 
<lb/>out to them, and frightful immorality 
<lb/>is the result. The prevailing 
<lb/>drunkeness makes it wonderful 
<lb/>that the people live at all. Our 
<lb/>expedition is hated as a sort 
<lb/>of standing protest against vice. 
<lb/>and we should be "good fellows" 
<lb/>only by joining in their vices. 
<lb/>With a soil and climate superior 
<lb/>to Natal nothing is done but 
<lb/>paltry peddling in ivory and 
<lb/>gold dust. When we go down 
<lb/>to the coast we have abundance of 
<lb/>fresh meat without trouble from 
<lb/>the game, but inland the grass, 
<lb/>intermingled with Indigo and cotton, 
<lb/>is too tall for hunting, and we 
<lb/>can get neither vegetables nor 
<lb/>fresh meat for either love or 
<lb/>money. I am trying to obtain 
<lb/>free navigation of the Zambesi 
<lb/>for all nations, and if you can 
<lb/>lend any influence to effect 
<lb/>it you will aid in breaking 
<lb/>up the exclusive system which 
<lb/>is the ruin of the country.</p>
<lb/><p>I am &amp;c David Livingstone</p><!--written up the side of page 1-->
<lb/><p>Had the projected Institution been in existence before <persName>Sechele</persName> fell away from his 
<lb/>profession of christianity his children might have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> great benefit 
<lb/>He sent them of his own accord to <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> for instruction and 
<lb/>I believe they were supported there for a time by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffats</persName> private bounty. 
<lb/>I am unaquainted with the missionaries now at <persName>Sechele's</persName>
<lb/><!--written up side of page 2 the word Manica is written over this???-->but imagine that they would gladly induce <persName>Sechele</persName> to avail 
<lb/>himself of any advantages you may have to bestow on his 
<lb/>children. and to me it would be a great satisfaction 
<lb/>to hear that any of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> had been so favoured. I do 
<lb/>very heartily bid you God Speed</p>
