<lb/><p>I send you the first 
<lb/>sheet of a letter I began for you but 
<lb/>could not finish by the time the <term type="boat">Pearl</term>
<lb/>left us just to shew you I was not 
<lb/>so unmindful of you as might be 
<lb/>inferred. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he other unfilled sheet 
<lb/>told of the damage of <placeName>Krootown</placeName> by 
<lb/>the present Governor Hill who was 
<lb/>extremely kind to us and the effect 
<lb/>on the general health. Now I go 
<lb/>without farther preface into the middle 
<lb/>of things and say that I have been 
<lb/>up at <placeName>Tete</placeName> with the first cargo - the 
<lb/>first steamer ever seen there and 
<lb/>was visited with as much interest 
<lb/>as the Leviathan. It would be 
<lb/>a vain attempt <del type="strikethrough">to meet</del> were I to 
<lb/>endeavour to tell you of my

<lb/>Poor fellows they grasped my

<lb/>The Portuguese could not get near me 
<lb/>for they clustered so closely. I never shed 
<lb/>tears but this time as I told them that 
<lb/>I had no <persName>Sekwebu</persName> with me the tears ran 
<lb/>down in spite of me. Thirty have 
<lb/>died of small pox and six were killed 
<lb/>by a half caste chief who holds a stockade 
<lb/>at the confluence of the <placeName>Luenya</placeName><reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>excuse is that it was done in a fit of 
<lb/>drunkeness. For them our hearts are 
<lb/>very sore. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey have accumulated a stock 
<lb/>of property in beads fowls &amp; pigs by 
<lb/>woodcutting &amp; other work and many of 
<lb/>them have taken wives and possibly a 
<lb/>few may remain altogether<reg>.</reg> But they  
<lb/>say the <placeName>Tette</placeName> people taunted us often 
<lb/>by saying your Englishmen will never 
<lb/>return but we trusted you and now 
<lb/>our hearts will sleep. </p>
<lb/><p>We got the <placeName>Tette</placeName> gentlemen to dig coals 
<lb/>for us, the very first ever taken out 
<lb/>of the seam in this country. We got a 
<lb/>ton and a half and the engineer reports 
<lb/>them to be good for steaming purposes 
<lb/>though what we have is from the 
<lb/>surface and exposed for ages in the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001365_0003"/><!--pb/@n='49r'--> 
<lb/>bank of a river to the action of floods 
<lb/>and our <del type="strikethrough">if</del><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Thornton</persName> our geologist 
<lb/>reports favourably of them too. He will 
<lb/>yet make a full report of the whole thing 
<lb/>quantity, quality &amp;c. With, as I believe 
<lb/>from my own former observations, no 
<lb/>end of coal and the best iron ore 
<lb/>Surely the Great Architect designed 
<lb/>something grand for the future of this 
<lb/>poor trodden down <placeName>Africa</placeName>. As for 
<lb/>me I will work with might and 
<lb/>main at this one thing that it be 
<lb/>opened to the gospel of the grace of 
<lb/>the Almighty. From all I hear 
<lb/>of <placeName>Kebra basa</placeName> it is not a waterfall 
<lb/>but a number of rocks jutting out 
<lb/>across the stream which render the 
<lb/>passage through deep tortuous and 
<lb/>dangerous. If half a years work 
<lb/>and a good deal of expense in gun 
<lb/>powder and sweat will remove 
<lb/>this obstacle then don<reg>'</reg>t be sur 
<lb/>prised at my turning quarryman 
<lb/>as well as consul &amp; "Skipper" but 
<lb/>I say nought about it till I see 
<lb/>and I am going up to see directly 
<lb/>while the river is low<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>The Naval officer who came with me 
<lb/>turned out badly, quarreled with everyone 
<lb/>and at last from the confident belief 
<lb/>that we could not move a mile without 
<lb/>him took on all manner of airs against 
<lb/>myself. I had to intefere for the protection 
<lb/>of my companions and especially 
<lb/>for the Captain of the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> and <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>
<lb/>at once resigned. I would have sent 
<lb/>him home at once but thinking it 
<lb/>would not be doing as I would be done 
<lb/>by if I did not give him a chance I allowed 
<lb/>him to with draw the letter. I could not allow 
<lb/>him to make the cabin of the Launch his 
<lb/>own private apartment and on seeing 
<lb/>him turn out the things of my companions 
<lb/>unceremoniously I requested him to ask 
<lb/>them first. Then came resignation second<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I bore with slander, carping, complaining 
<lb/>raising objections and endeavouring 
<lb/>to excite the Kroomen to mutiny to the 
<lb/>utmost limits of endurance but he 
<lb/>went on from bad to worse - ran 
<lb/>the boat aground and said to one of the 
<lb/>officers "<choice><reg>D</reg><orig>d</orig></choice>o you think they could do 
<lb/>without me<reg>?</reg>" So I accepted his resignation 
<lb/>and mounted the paddle box myself 
<lb/>made quicker passages - carrying heavier 
<lb/>loads than was ever done before<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>First trip I never once touched the 
<lb/>ground and he never made a trip without 
<lb/>doing so several times and delayed us by 
<lb/>clumsiness in getting her off. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>tried it too and was equally successful 
<lb/>so we got two skippers instead of one. 
<lb/>When we returned from our first trip 
<lb/>never did lower jaw descend like his 
<lb/>when we came in "Ease her, stop her, let 
<lb/>go the anchor " All right. He then tried in 
<lb/>various ways to secure his pay but 
<lb/>failed though he accused me of cruelty 
<lb/>harshness &amp;c &amp;c because I ordered him 
<lb/>off to <placeName>Kilimane</placeName> and thence home. 
<lb/>I never met a person who had so 
<lb/>little regard to truth as he. He seemed 
<lb/>to trust to unlimited assertion and 
<lb/>even wrote a log after his dismissal 
<lb/>in which he changes sides making 
<lb/>me the person who hindered our progress 
<lb/>and himself the person anxious to get on<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>It was awfully painful to witness all this 
<lb/>in connection with extra ostentatious 
<lb/>piety. His <hi rend="underline">secret</hi> prayers must be done 
<lb/>in sight of the whole ship. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut if you 
<lb/>will not be offended I enclose some of the 
<lb/>rough copy I have sent home to Foreign 
<lb/>Office<reg>.</reg> All the rest of my companions 
<lb/>are agreeable. Not a single jar and 
<lb/>with B. I had no quarrel. What he 
<lb/>may make a noise about is the following<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I consider this Expedition as experimental 
<lb/>in various respects one of these is 
<lb/>the health. Now the great <placeName>Niger</placeName> Expedition 
<lb/>if I am rightly informed had prayers 
<lb/>read three times a day and stopped all 
<lb/>Sunday. Warned by its fate I resolved 
<lb/>to lose not a moment in getting my 
<lb/>party out of the Mangrove swamps 
<lb/>and worked on that day at what I 
<lb/>believe to be service to Christ Our Lord 
<lb/>after asking the leave of the men 
<lb/>I sent the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> off without a case<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p><fw>28 Sept. 1858 (continued)</fw> 
<lb/>People may talk against this<reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey talked 
<lb/>more against the <placeName>Niger</placeName> Expedition's loss 
<lb/>of life. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen when we got out of the 
<lb/>swamps of Mangrove &amp; mud we found 
<lb/>the country in a state of war and 
<lb/>I could not rest all day on Sunday 
<lb/>while my companions were exposed 
<lb/>to be plundered. So I never stopped 
<lb/>except to have a public religious 
<lb/>service unless we were all together 
<lb/>on the island. We have had no 
<lb/>fever yet some colds which resemble 
<lb/>fever a little but nothing serious. This 
<lb/>is a sand river in contrast to the 
<lb/>muddy ones of the West. The river is 
<lb/>now near its lowest point, and 
<lb/>as it is spread over between from one 
<lb/>mile to three in width we found 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>siderable</w> difficulty in getting a deep 
<lb/>channel. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut when we got to <placeName>Lupata</placeName>
<lb/>all difficulties of that kind ended<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Two naval officers gave a very 
<lb/>favourable report when it was five 
<lb/>or six feet higher than now. I see it 
<lb/>in its worst state and a vessel 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001365_0008"/><!--pb/@n='51v'--> 
<lb/>drawing three feet would navigate it with ease<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I was led to trust in the report of the naval 
<lb/>officer respecting this Launch the <term type="boat">Ma Robert</term>
<lb/>and was <choice><sic>decieved</sic><corr>deceived</corr></choice> for instead of as he said 
<lb/>very little wood being required we spend 
<lb/>half our time wood cutting and she has 
<lb/>a badly constructed engine - so weak too 
<lb/>the canoes pass us in ascending &amp; look 
<lb/>back at the "Asthmatic" as she ought to 
<lb/>be called. It is a great shame to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Laird</persName> to send such a job from his shop 
<lb/>the vessel herself is good &amp; a well made 
<lb/>one - broader &amp; shorter would save our 
<lb/>sailors an immense amount of labour but the 
<lb/>engine is a wretched thing but here we 
<lb/>are &amp; will make the best of it. <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>'s 
<lb/>untruthfulness began in England. He led me 
<lb/>to reject the <term type="boat">Ban</term> a fine vessel drawing 3 
<lb/>feet but I find now it was because he 
<lb/>would have been required to navigate her out 
<lb/>and he could not from sea sickness<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he war is finished. It was nothing to us for we 
<lb/>went from one side to the other perpetually as friends 
<lb/>of both. We sometimes raised an alarm in the 
<lb/>rebel camp by coming near their sentinels by night 
<lb/>but when we called out "English" (Maingleze) 
<lb/>all was right. Several influential Portuguese wished 
<lb/>to accept my mediation but the Governor refused<reg>.</reg>
