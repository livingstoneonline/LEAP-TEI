<lb/><p><add place="top" hand="#hand01">Part of letter from D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Livingston 
<lb/>to Robert Moffat Oct 1849</add></p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> October 1849</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Father</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I wrote a note to you when at the <unclear cert="low"><term type="tribe">Batasana</term></unclear>
<lb/>&amp; informed you that the Latitude was 19° but we had made 
<lb/>the calculation without the <term type="reference"> Nautical Almanack</term> &amp; when 
<lb/>we reached the waggon it was seen to be no more 
<lb/>than 20° 20′ South &amp; about 24° Long. E<reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he distance 
<lb/>travelled might be about 600 miles, as we went North 
<lb/>&amp; then a long way to the Westward. After this correction 
<lb/>I do not feel inclined to say much more for you 
<lb/>will soon have <persName><choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> &amp; <persName>Murray</persName> who will 
<w>commun-<lb break="no"/>icate</w> all particulars viva voce. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <foreign xml:lang="und"><!-- african word or tribe??-->Bakolia</foreign><add place="above">(slaves)</add> as 
<lb/>they are called by <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> or <foreign xml:lang="und"><!--or tribe??-->Bayeiye</foreign><add place="above">(men)</add> as they 
<lb/>call themselves were the most interesting people we 
<lb/>saw. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are darker in complexion than <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>&amp; speak another language. Many of them however have 
<lb/>learned to speak <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>itchuana fluently. I derived more 
<lb/>pleasure from sailing along the <placeName>river Zouga</placeName> in 
<lb/>their canoes and addressing them 
<lb/>in their little villages 
<lb/>among the <unclear cert="low">reed</unclear> than from all the journey. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>esides 
<lb/>they seemed fine frank fellows, and understood the 
<lb/>message delivered better than any lot I ever addressed<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>For the last time <persName>Oreeja</persName> is the name they give to 
<lb/>the Deity. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey mentioned the names of the first 
<lb/>man &amp; woman &amp; if I mistook them not had some 
<lb/>tradition respecting the flood. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey catch fish 
<lb/>by means of nets. I shall send a list to you 
<lb/>the fish are very fine. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>ome are said to be as long

<lb/>as a man. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he longest I saw was about three feet<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey kill hippopotami by means of harpoons attached 
<lb/>to ropes. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir canoes are poor things generally made 
<lb/>of single trees &amp; flat bottomed. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>ome of them take 
<lb/>the form of the tree though that may have been like the 
<lb/>letter S. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Batletli</term> are a small tribe and the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakurutse</term> are divided into three. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are a branch 
<lb/>of the Bakurutse and split off about 3 generations 
<lb/>ago. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="tribe">Batasana</term> is a large tribe but the chief 
<lb/>a mere boy is an unfavourable specimen. He 
<lb/>prevented us going on to <choice><sic>Sebitoane</sic><corr>Sebituane</corr></choice>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he latter <add place="above">chief</add> took 
<lb/>all the cattle from the <term type="tribe">Batletli</term> and <term type="tribe">Bakurutse</term> and 
<lb/>now they have nothing but the produce of their 
<lb/>gardens &amp; fish to live on. <choice><reg>N</reg><orig>n</orig></choice>one of them ever heard 
<lb/>of the sea or saw a European before. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey were 
<lb/>afraid or distrustful of us at first but in returning 
<lb/>were more frank &amp; open. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <placeName>Zouga</placeName> is a <unclear cert="medium">noble</unclear>
<lb/>river, &amp; remarkable for its periodical rise &amp; 
<lb/>fall. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he rise was taking place when we 
<lb/>were there and the water perfectly pure &amp; cold &amp; 
<lb/>soft gave the idea of melting snow<reg>.</reg> It runs 
<lb/>to the N.E but does not derive its waters 
<lb/>from the Lake although it appears to do so<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <unclear cert="low">Batoka</unclear> told me <choice><sic>eplicitly</sic><corr>explicitly</corr></choice> that the water came from the North by a river which 
<lb/>flows into <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">it</add><placeName>the Tamunakle</placeName> (T a m u n a k l e) &amp; 
<lb/>this is connected with other large rivers all 
<lb/>in the North &amp; all navigable. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey seem to me 
<lb/>to form a highway into a large section of 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000681_0003"/><!--pb/@n='5r'-->
<lb/>country. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he prospect of this being opened up for missionaries 
<lb/>makes the discovery of the Lake dwindle into nothing. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>natives asserted that the rise in the river was not 
<lb/>caused by rains. A man in a hilly country called 
<lb/><placeName><unclear cert="low">Mazyekua</unclear></placeName> kills a man annually and throws 
<lb/>his body into the river after which the water comes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>As the water became softer the nearer we approached 
<lb/>the junction with the <placeName>Tamunakle</placeName> &amp; the air was 
<lb/>remarkably keen &amp; cold I could only conjecture 
<lb/>that snow must be melting in some region 
<lb/>the North. I never had such a keen apetite 
<lb/>before &amp; we were all alike. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his, although our 
<lb/>altitude was not much above 2000 f<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">t</hi></hi>. a 
<lb/>great deal lower than <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he disease 
<lb/>called <term type="ailment">"holsetse"</term> seems inflammation of the 
<lb/>lungs. <choice><reg>W</reg><orig>w</orig></choice>e heard more coughing than among 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd immense clouds of very fine 
<lb/>dust arise from numerous salt pans <choice><sic>ajacent</sic><corr>adjacent</corr></choice>
<lb/>when the wind blows the whole country seems 
<lb/>enveloped in a mist and as it irritates the eyes 
<lb/>it may act like the same <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">very fine dust</add> thing among the 
<lb/>grinders in <placeName>Sheffield</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he symptoms mentioned 
<lb/>are more like those of <term type="ailment">pneumonia</term> than <term type="ailment">fever</term><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I found a new kind of flint on the opposite 
<lb/>bank of the <placeName>Zouga</placeName>. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> will shew it you 
<lb/>Although this is dated <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName>, I am still 150 miles 
<lb/>off. I note a few things to save time when by 
<lb/>the goodness of God I reach there. His kindness 
<lb/>has been continually bestowed on us through the 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000681_0004"/><!--pb/@n='5v'-->
<lb/>whole journey, and I feel most thankful for his 
<lb/>abounding mercies. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he time has been much longer 
<lb/>than I anticipated. It was reported to be 10 days 
<lb/>from the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term><reg>.</reg> But that was not the 
<lb/>Lake it was only the <placeName>Noka ea Batletle</placeName> or <placeName>river 
<lb/>Zouga</placeName>. We had to travel 300 miles beyond before 
<lb/>we saw the <placeName>Lake Ñami</placeName> or as the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> call it Mghabi. Ñami means water or great water 
<lb/>in the <unclear cert="low">Bakoba</unclear> language. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>mi is water itself - serapo is 
<lb/>the paddle - <unclear cert="low">añkaslu</unclear> the boat hook - mero fishhook &amp; wotu canoe 
<lb/>I shall give you some words when I have time only 21 
<lb/>in about 300 resemble <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>itchuana. We were full 
<lb/>of conjectures before we reached the Lake. 
<lb/>When 200 miles off we were speculating on the 
<lb/>dew on the grass shewing the vicinity of the Lake 
<lb/>clouds in the distance were sure to be hovering 
<lb/>over it &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<lb/><p>12 October - Reached home two days ago thankful 
<lb/>to find though all had been ill &amp; much disease &amp; 
<lb/>death had been in the town my family were 
<lb/>in pretty good health. We were more troubled 
<lb/>for want of water in coming out than in 
<lb/>going in. <persName>Sekhomi</persName> filled up the wells we 
<lb/>dug. <persName>Mr <choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> remains at <placeName>Lopepe</placeName> 100 miles 
<lb/>from this. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Murray</persName> gets the spare oxen in 
<lb/>order to push on - I <unclear cert="low">endure</unclear> here on horseback 
<lb/>to get oxen to bring <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> out.</p><!--letter ends here-->
