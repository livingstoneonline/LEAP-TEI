<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName><settlement>Kuruman</settlement></placeName><date when="1841-08-04">4<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> August 1841</date></p>
<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear Brother</p>
<lb/><p>Through the gracious care of our Heavenly 
<lb/>Father I have at last safely reached this which for a little is to be 
<lb/>my resting or rather halting place. I have been ten weeks 
<lb/>on this journey but having visited the various <term type="occupation">missionary</term> 
<lb/>institutions lying near our route I have not been more 
<lb/>than 2 months in continuous journeying. The <term type="animal">oxen</term> are 
<lb/>slow paced, resembling much in this respect the common 
<lb/>cart <term type="animal">horses</term> at home, and then we have such terrible 
<lb/>roads it is frequently difficult to get along at all――
<lb/>I intend (<persName><choice><abbr>D.V.</abbr><expan>Deo Volente</expan></choice></persName>) to remain here for about 2 months for the purpose 
<lb/>of acquiring a little of the colloquial language and then with 
<lb/>the hope of fully mastering the whole I shall proceed to the 
<lb/>northward &amp; live excluded from all European society - 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> of this station intends to accommpany me to an 
<lb/>extensive population at the distance of about a fortnight 
<lb/>or three weeks from this. We shall collect information 
<lb/>respecting their state &amp; the state of the surrounding country, 
<lb/>and if circumstances are favourable for the formation 
<lb/>of a new <orgName>mission</orgName>, After two months more, leaving me.  
<lb/>He will revisit his family &amp; afterwards return &amp; we shall 
<lb/>proceed to the erection of houses &amp;c. This course of exclusion 
<lb/>from European society is almost absolutely <add place="above">necessary</add><add place="below">^</add> for one <w>begin<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-ning</w> the language. I must form my own vocabulary 
<lb/>&amp; <del type="cancelled">almost</del> nearly construct my own grammar &amp; I must so 
<lb/>mingle with the natives as to learn accurately their mode 
<lb/>of thinking or I shall never <add place="above">be</add><add place="below">^</add> of much use as a preacher 
<lb/>I hear <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> intends publishing a grammar &amp; dictionary 
<lb/>These will be truly invaluable to all future missionaries

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000485_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>In the mean time I must take the only course left for me, <del type="cancelled">and shall</del>
<lb/>I go forward to mingle in a state of society of which you in 
<lb/><placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName> can form but a very faint idea. In the <orgName>colony</orgName> &amp; even 
<lb/>far beyond it civilization has exerted a powerful influence 
<lb/>men &amp; women are ashamed to be seen in a state bordering upon 
<lb/>entire nudity but immediately beyond the range of the itineracies 
<lb/>of this station you have all living in a state of complete 
<lb/>savageism. I have seen several specimens pass through 
<lb/>this &amp; really they give me a much better idea of what pure 
<lb/>heathenism is than even I possessed before. Bows, arrows 
<lb/>&amp; assagais which in the hands of those under <term type="occupation">missionary</term> 
<lb/>influence seemed puny instruments, now look terrible 
<lb/>weapons when <unclear cert="high">bristling</unclear> around the wild, restless, sparkling eye 
<lb/>of the real savage smeared all over with red paint―― 
<lb/>Among these I shall soon take up my abode Do remember 
<lb/>me in your prayers that I may be kept faithful into 
<lb/>death. And pure amidst awful impurity――</p>
<lb/><p>We passed through many <term type="occupation">missionary</term> institutions &amp; 
<lb/>were much gratified by much that we witnessed. The 
<lb/>churches at home know comparatively little of the success
<lb/>which has attended the labours of <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> in this 
<lb/>country. I always imagined that <term type="occupation"><choice><abbr>Miss<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</abbr><expan>Missionaries</expan></choice></term> were in many 
<lb/>instances men of sanguine temperament &amp; sent home 
<lb/>accounts tinged a little by their wishes but wherever I hav<gap agent="hole" extent="1" unit="chars"/><supplied cert="high">e</supplied>
<lb/>been I have been convinced by actual inspection that the 
<lb/>reports have been far within the truth. I grieve that 
<lb/>the churches at home are so little acquainted with the 
<lb/>eminent success which has attended the preaching of the 
<lb/>gospel in <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>.  In many places it is truly delightful 
<lb/>to behold the <orgName>Christian</orgName> deportment of the natives - Their sense 
<lb/>of <orgName>Christian</orgName> propriety is <del type="cancelled">truly</del> really astonishing.  On one <w>occasi<gap agent="hole" extent="2" unit="chars"/><supplied cert="high">on</supplied></w>
<lb/>we had to travel a long way without water and as it was <w>Saturd<gap agent="hole" extent="1" unit="chars"/><supplied cert="high">ay</supplied></w>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000485_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>we hurried on till late <del type="cancelled">at night</del> but failed to reach water that night 
<lb/>Both on our own account &amp; for the sake of the <term type="animal">oxen</term> we were obliged to 
<lb/>travel next morning, Before we had arrived at the water however we 
<lb/>were reproved by a <term type="tribe">Bushman</term> for traveling on sabbath. He said it was 
<lb/>very wrong to travel on sunday. We explained but it did not seem to satisfy 
<lb/>him.<space dim="horizontal" extent="5" unit="chars"/>Near the spot where we came to the water stood a <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term>
<lb/>village consisting of about 100 houses. It had a <orgName>native</orgName> teacher connected 
<lb/>with the <orgName><placeName><settlement type="town">Guqua Town</settlement></placeName> mission</orgName>,  had seldom even been visited by a 
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionary</term> but they hold service regularly in a house appropriated 
<lb/>to that purpose &amp; for holding school. After morning service the <term type="occupation">chief</term> with 
<lb/>the <orgName>native</orgName> teacher &amp; principal people of the village came &amp; requested an
<lb/>explanation of our conduct. That being given it was next demanded 
<lb/>why we had not come to church since we had come early enough for 
<lb/>that. We knew not that they had a church but were glad to meet with
<lb/>them in the afternoon. Next morning they purchased many <term type="tribe"><w>sitchua<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-na</w></term> testaments from us. I never saw such thirst for the word of 
<lb/>God before. All seemed eager to possess a copy ―― A<del type="cancelled">n</del> mighty 
<lb/>work is going forward here. &amp; much more might be done 
<lb/>were there means for the employment of <orgName>native</orgName> agency 
<lb/>Believers every where amongst these people preach as soon <gap extent="2" unit="chars" agent="fading"/> as
<lb/>they feel the value of the gospel &amp; although they have much oppo<gap extent="6" unit="chars" agent="blotting"/>
<lb/>to contend against. &amp; no worldly support save what results from<gap extent="3" unit="chars" agent="blotting"/>
<lb/>own industry they persevere amazingly. The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> are great 
<lb/>retailers of news. Every circumstance that occurs is handed from 
<lb/>one to another. They are too, perpetually on the move from one spot to
<lb/>another. We have people here who have come several hundreds of 
<lb/>miles from the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>.  This <add place="above">nomadic</add><del type="cancelled">predatory</del> life is very favourable 
<lb/>to the spread of the gospel although it is opposed to the spread of 
<lb/>civilization. Ought the churches at home to not take advantage of 
<lb/>their predatory newstelling propensities, I think they ought for 
<lb/>I <gap extent="7" unit="chars" agent="fading"/>it is no uncommon thing for a <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> after he 
<lb/>has heard a sermon to <gap extent="2" unit="chars" agent="tear"/> down among his friends at a 
<lb/>distance &amp; relate the whole of <add place="above">it</add><add place="below">^</add> word for word.  <orgName>Native</orgName> agency (I 
<lb/>am fully convinced) although it has many evils <choice><sic>connectd</sic><corr>connected</corr></choice> with it 
<lb/>is the only thing that can evangelize the world.</p>
<lb/><p>Please <choice><sic>to</sic><corr cert="high">do</corr></choice> excuse the short note. This opportunity of sending 
<lb/>letters is the only one expect to have for a long time &amp; this one 
<lb/>is over tomorrow morning. I should have liked much 
<lb/>if it had been in my power to write to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Kirk</persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi></persName></p><!-- Another repetition on last word on this page and first word on next page...how to code? HB 10/4/12 -->
