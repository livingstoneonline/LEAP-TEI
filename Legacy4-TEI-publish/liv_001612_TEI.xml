<lb/><p rend="right"> 12 ap 1861</p>
<lb/><p rend="left"> My Lord</p>
<lb/><p>We have lately taken the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>
<lb/>who came with me to <placeName>Tette</placeName> back to their 
<lb/>own country, as we were in honour bound 
<lb/>to do, though it involved a march of over 
<lb/>600 miles on foot. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he most important 
<lb/>geographical points observed were the 
<lb/>extension of the coal field which begins 
<lb/>below <placeName>Tette</placeName> nearly up to the <placeName>Falls of Victoria</placeName>
<lb/>and these same <choice><reg>F</reg><orig>f</orig></choice>alls themselves. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he coal 
<lb/>will probably play an important part 
<lb/>in the future of the <placeName>Cape Colony</placeName> though 
<lb/>by a rather short sighted treaty with the <term type="tribe">Boers,</term>
<lb/>our traders are debarred at present from 
<lb/>the trade of that region. By a second visit 
<lb/>to the <placeName>falls</placeName> &amp; by careful measurement I am 
<lb/>inclined to call them the most wonderful 
<lb/>in the world. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are about twice the 
<lb/>depth of <placeName>Niagara,</placeName> and if I recollect rightly 
<lb/>considerably broader or 1860 yards. That 
<lb/>is, more than an English mile. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen the 
<lb/>water falls into a crack which is prolonged <figure><!--<graphic style="float:left" url="LETT1157-1.gif"/>--><figDesc>diagram of a river</figDesc></figure>
<lb/>in a most remarkable zig zag manner. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>promontories formed by the wavy form 
<lb/>of the crack are exactly the same 
<lb/>level as the bed of the river above 
<lb/><placeName>the falls</placeName> and you can walk

<lb/>along facing the <placeName>the falls</placeName> at the first promontory 
<lb/>or in the others with the river some 300 feet 
<lb/>below and on each side of you jammed at 
<lb/>the bottom of the crack in some 20 or 30 yards<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We saw the columns of vapour which come 
<lb/>up out of the fizzure twenty miles off, and 
<lb/>though it was the period of extreme low 
<lb/>water there were eight hundred feet of water 
<lb/>actually falling. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his, in a country set down 
<lb/>by speculative geographers as "interminable 
<lb/>sandy plains into which rivers ran and 
<lb/>were lost." is sufficiently interesting for it 
<lb/>may be inferred that the world did not 
<lb/>know what <placeName>Africa</placeName> was, or what it is 
<lb/>capable of becoming. When in <placeName>Africa</placeName> formerly, 
<lb/>I had no more idea of writing a book on it 
<lb/>than <persName>your Lordship</persName> has of becoming an 
<lb/>elephant hunter. I now see many things 
<lb/>which then escaped my notice, and this 
<lb/>is especially the case in the matter of cotton. 
<lb/>In the <placeName>central districts</placeName> I could not recollect 
<lb/>having seen the plant, but we now saw 
<lb/>it so large that boys climb up the trees, 
<lb/>and of a quality which can only be produced 
<lb/>in some parts of <placeName>South America.</placeName> All the 
<lb/>specimens we have sent home to <placeName>Manchester</placeName>
<lb/>have <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">been declared</add> of higher value than the common 
<lb/>cultivated kinds of <placeName>America.</placeName>It would be 
<lb/>a mistake to distribute foreign seed. Indeed 
<lb/>while in <placeName>America</placeName> it must always be treated 
<lb/>as an exotic, here it is in its native country

<lb/>and the annual burning of the grass does not 
<lb/>destroy it. I am exceedingly glad to hear that 
<lb/>a mission from the English Universities 
<lb/>is to be established in the Interior which in 
<lb/>addition to Christian instruction will 
<lb/>labour to introduce lawful trade. That 
<lb/>in cotton will be the most easily established 
<lb/>the more especially if the missionaries like 
<lb/>the monks previous to the period of their corruption 
<lb/>do not disdain to hold the plough. We mean 
<lb/>to try and find an entrance to the Interior 
<lb/>of the country exterior to the Portuguese 
<lb/>claims for it is impossible to do 
<lb/>anything among them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is to be the first 
<lb/>service of our new vessel which I am 
<lb/>very thankful to hear your Government 
<lb/>has granted. We are now down here 
<lb/>expecting its arrival every day. We are 
<lb/>surrounded by swamps for at least a 
<lb/>hundred miles - eight miles of our vicinity 
<lb/>consists of the deadly mangrove swamp 
<lb/>which is believed to be the very hot bed of 
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever,</term> and which, as often as the tide retires 
<lb/>emits most offensive effluvia. I do not 
<lb/>mention this to magnify the service, but 
<lb/>as a sort of introduction to what I am 
<lb/>sure you will be glad to learn, that we believe 
<lb/>we now know the remedy for <term type="ailment">Fever.</term>
<lb/>With this remedy we find the disease no 
<lb/>worse than a <term type="ailment">common cold</term> - and you know 
<lb/>what used to be the consequence of sleeping 
<lb/>ashore among the mangroves.

<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he first time I employed it was in the case 
<lb/>of my own children in 1850 at <placeName>Lake Ngami,</placeName>
<lb/>and I have never found it to fail in a single case 
<lb/>since. I was however not sure that it would 
<lb/>prove efficacious in Europeans generally until 
<lb/>the ample experience of this Expedition demonstrated 
<lb/>it. It is noticed near the end of my book but 
<lb/>people are so often <choice><sic>decieved</sic><corr>deceived</corr></choice> in medicine that 
<lb/>I felt it would look quackish if I spoke positively. 
<lb/><choice><reg>O</reg><orig>o</orig></choice>n reaching <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName> we heard for the first 
<lb/>time that a party of <placeName>London</placeName> missionaries 
<lb/>had been cut off by <term type="ailment">fever</term> at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> and 
<lb/>this took place at the very time that we were 
<lb/>in the way, and curing severe cases in Europeans 
<lb/>so quickly that our march on foot was rarely 
<lb/>interupted more than a day or two - I found 
<lb/>too the proper medicines for its composition 
<lb/>in my waggon which has been kept for me 
<lb/>seven years within a few hundred yards of their 
<lb/>graves. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir unhappy fate made me 
<lb/>resolve to say more about it. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he medicines 
<lb/>employed are common ones. I have 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>municated</w> it formerly to <persName>Lord John Russell</persName>
<lb/>and should it prove as useful in the West as 
<lb/>we have found it in the East a saving of 
<lb/>human life will be effected<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I hope to have something more interesting 
<lb/>to communicate on our return from the 
<lb/><placeName>Rovuma,</placeName> and am exceedingly pleased to hear 
<lb/>that you and <persName>Lady Palmerston</persName> take a kind 
<lb/>interest in my proceedings. Your encouraging
