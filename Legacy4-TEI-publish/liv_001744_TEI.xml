<lb/><p rend="right">near <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> Zambesi</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">7 March 1862</p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>We found that 35 tons was 
<lb/>more than <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> could carry - 
<lb/>took out 5 tons at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>
<lb/>and avoided the strong current 
<lb/>now in <add place="above"> - parts of </add>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> of 4 1/2 knots 
<lb/>by going into shallow places. 
<lb/>This unfortunately led us aground 
<lb/>four or five miles above 
<lb/><placeName>Shupanga</placeName> and the river is 
<lb/>falling. It is the worst grounding 
<lb/>we ever had for we have 100 
<lb/>yards of shoal on our lee or 
<lb/>down river from us. I let 
<lb/>you know lest you hear something 
<lb/>worse. I was unable to 
<lb/>do duty when she might have 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001744_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>been got off but <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName> is said by <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> to be 
<lb/>"a thorough sailor", so I believe 
<lb/>everything proper has been done<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>This was my first illness 
<lb/>since leaving England in /58<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We don<reg>'</reg>t know what it was 
<lb/>Feet and knees swelled and 
<lb/>were so painful for 2 days 
<lb/>that I could not stand. An 
<lb/>eruption came out, began 
<lb/>with <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> and went over 
<lb/>us all. Even <term type="boat">Gorgon's</term> people 
<lb/>took it. I was down three days 
<lb/>but am now I am thankful 
<lb/>to say quite free of the complaint<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I say so much about myself 
<lb/>because people at the Cape made 
<lb/>me so ill when nothing was wrong 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001744_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>whatever</p>
<lb/><p>I have sent a pressing request to 
<lb/><persName>Admiral Walker</persName> for provisions 
<lb/>for we have not a fortnight's 
<lb/>food on board, and cannot buy 
<lb/>any at this part nor indeed 
<lb/>in any part where slavetrade 
<lb/>has depopulated the country. 
<lb/>I propose, if no vessel is to be 
<lb/>sent this way, that the <persName>Admiral</persName>
<lb/>should freight a small one from 
<lb/><placeName>Natal</placeName>. I ask 6 months stores<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We have been disappointed 
<lb/>in not <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice><term type="remedy">quinine</term> from 
<lb/>you along with the other 
<lb/>medicines &amp; ask 3lbs from the 
<lb/><persName>Admiral</persName>. We need all this 
<lb/>while giving it daily to all hands<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We don<reg>'</reg>t see a paddle wheel 
<lb/>Boss ordered from <persName>Penn</persName> when 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> was at the Cape. 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001744_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>It is much needed for the other side<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The reason why the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> goes so 
<lb/>slow with a load is said to be her 
<lb/>engines were placed for 3 feet draught 
<lb/>and she never draws less than 4 1/2 
<lb/>now with a load 5 - they would 
<lb/>require to be lifted up a foot &amp; a half<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We shall put the new steamer together 
<lb/>at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> and tow her up to 
<lb/>the cataracts - I doubt <persName>Hardisty<reg>'</reg>s</persName> zeal.</p>
<lb/><p>A gentleman has been sent out 
<lb/>by the free church of Scotland to obtain 
<lb/>information with a view to 
<lb/>a mission on <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. As this 
<lb/>will not interfere with the bishop, 
<lb/>I invited him to come up and 
<lb/>see the country and people for 
<lb/>himself. His name is <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi>
<lb/>James Stewart</persName>. There is room 
<lb/>for all that in the region, and it is 
<lb/>questionable whether the bishop 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001744_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'-->
<lb/>has not blocked up his own way 
<lb/>Northwards by attacking the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Ajawa</term>, who now possess all 
<lb/>the East bank of <placeName>Shire</placeName> from 
<lb/>the cataracts up to the Lake. 
<lb/>His sister, <hi rend="underline">a confirmed invalid</hi>, 
<lb/>came up to him. <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Wilson</persName> seeing how slowly we 
<lb/>got up - (3 weeks to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>! 
<lb/>Last year 2 days only!) acceded to 
<lb/>her request to be taken with <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi>
<lb/>Burrup</persName> (another of the missionaries) 
<lb/>forward to the <placeName>Ruo</placeName> in his gig. 
<lb/>The bishop engaged to be there 
<lb/>but did not appear &amp; <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Wilson</persName> pushed on to <persName>Chibisa's</persName>
<lb/>the invalid being more dead 
<lb/>than alive. We expect him 
<lb/>daily on his return, and when 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001744_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'-->
<lb/>he does so I shall give you the 
<lb/>latest intelligence.</p>
<lb/><p>I feel it rather too much to have to 
<lb/>give passages to all the missionaries 
<lb/>I was willing and anxious to 
<lb/>do all I could for them &amp; am 
<lb/>still willing, but it is a serious 
<lb/>draw back to our own success. 
<lb/><persName>Rev M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Proctor</persName> wanted to come down 
<lb/>for a wife, &amp; the bishop proposed 
<lb/>to come too. I had to tell them 
<lb/>that the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> was not a 
<lb/>passenger vessel. It is a serious 
<lb/>tax on our stores. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Stewart</persName>
<lb/>offers payment for everything 
<lb/>has calico to buy his own 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>visions</w> and works at whatever 
<lb/>he can do. Some of the bishop's 
<lb/>people believe that they have a 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001744_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'-->
<lb/>right to everything here, and on board 
<lb/>the men of war which causes 
<lb/>grumbling among the officers.</p>
<lb/><p>You really had a serious task 
<lb/>imposed on  you. The only way 
<lb/>my daughter could <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> of 
<lb/>to keep her Mama at home 
<lb/>was to threaten to write to you 
<lb/>and ask you to lock her in a 
<lb/>room. She went the length of 
<lb/>writing to her Mama &amp; telling her 
<lb/>that she was thinking of doing 
<lb/>it!</p>
<lb/><p>10 March at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> unloading.</p>
<lb/><p>I have to spend more money than 
<lb/>I anticipated in buying country 
<lb/>provisions. We have nothing but a 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">little flour - a cask said to be beef by 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Gedye</persName> turns out to be one of 
<lb/>vinegar</del>! <add place="above">beef found on 17th March<reg>.</reg></add> We shall be two months 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001744_0008"/><!--pb/@n='8'-->
<lb/>putting <term type="boat">Lady Nyassa</term> together - will tow 
<lb/>her up to the cataracts &amp; there unscrew 
<lb/>her - probably we shall have food 
<lb/>before that from the Admiral - so no 
<lb/>uneasiness need be felt. There too 
<lb/>we can get plenty of native meal 
<lb/>goats<reg>,</reg> fowls &amp;c.</p>
<lb/><p>I may have mentioned already 
<lb/>that I offered the charge of the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term>
<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><unclear cert="low">Gedye</unclear></persName> at <placeName>Johanna</placeName> - &amp; he refused 
<lb/>it on the plea that he could not 
<lb/>navigate. I offered to lay down 
<lb/>his positions for him &amp; point out 
<lb/>the course but he again refused 
<lb/>to take charge =<!--TRANSC: this is an equals sign--> so the subordinate 
<lb/>position he occupied was his own 
<lb/>choice.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName> refused fowling pieces 
<lb/>Two we brought are broken. 
<lb/>I send up to <placeName>Tette</placeName> to bring our things 
<lb/>away, in canoes. We have plenty of 
<lb/>ammunition there. D. Livingstone</p>
