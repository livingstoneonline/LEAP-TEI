<lb/>to the neglect of every permanent source

<lb/>was transported on the shoulders and heads

<lb/>were intended for exportation. And even

<lb/>be turned to much advantage for water

<lb/>had access, the slaves did not form 5 percent of

<lb/>very few whites comparatively, and from the polite

<lb/>admitted to the tables of the more affluent, it might 
<lb/>be inferred that there is as little prejudice against

<lb/>their duty well, and are excellent soldiers. 
<lb/>Some ascribe the remarkable change to the 
<lb/>utter hopelessness of escape<add place="inline" hand="#hand01">,</add> - the certainty of
