<lb/><p>The <persName><choice><abbr>Lieut.</abbr></choice><expan>Lieutenant</expan>Governor Darling.</persName></p>
<lb/><p rend="center">May it please your Honor.</p>
<lb/><p>In reference to the treaty entered into 
<lb/>by Her Majesty<supplied>'</supplied>s Commissioners with Emigrant <term type="nationality">Boers</term>
<lb/>on the <date when="1852-01-16">16<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> of January</date> last, I have the honour to inform 
<lb/>the Government that the provision therein made for the 
<lb/>free accep of <choice><sic>Brittish</sic><corr>British</corr></choice> travellers to the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake</geogName></placeName> and countries 
<lb/>beyond have lately been violated by a Commando of the 
<lb/>above named <term type="nationality">Boers</term>. It was accompanied by some <w>hun-
<lb break="no"/>dreds</w> of natives, but the Commando was composed of six 
<lb/>hundred mounted <term type="nationality">Boers</term>, and as I know from repeated <w>in-
<lb break="no"/>spection</w> of the entire district of <placeName><region>Magaliesberg</region></placeName> that the  
<lb/>Emigrant population is under four thousand souls, the 
<lb/>violation of treaty, to which in the following particulars I 
<lb/>respectfully call the attention of your Honor, is not the act 
<lb/>of a small and unauthorized portion of the Community, 
<lb/>but that of the body whose independence the treaty of the <date when="1852-01-16">16<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi>
<lb/>January</date> was meant to recognize.</p>
<lb/><p>The above mentioned Commando made its <w>appear- 
<lb break="no"/>ance</w> in the <placeName><region>Bakwanian Country</region></placeName> on the <date when="1852-08-27">27<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> <choice><abbr>Ult.</abbr><expan>Ultimo</expan></choice></date> A party with 
<lb/>four <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>s was detached from the main body, in order to 
<lb/>plunder any house which is situated eight miles north from 
<lb/>the <placeName><settlement type="town">town of <persName>Secheli</persName></settlement></placeName>. They destroyed books, medicines and 
<lb/>surgical instruments worth upwards of £150 - and carried off 
<lb/>or destroyed furniture and other property of more than £185. 
<lb/>value making my personal losses amount to £335.</p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000769_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>They also took away or destroyed the stores and cattle of some 
<lb/>respectable English travellers, <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice><choice><abbr>Messrs</abbr><expan>Misters</expan></choice><persName>Webb</persName>, <persName>Codrington</persName>
<lb/><persName>Green</persName> &amp;c &amp;c. who are now exploring the <placeName><country>Country of Sebitoane</country></placeName>; the  
<lb/>distance from the Colony to that country renders relays of <w>cat-
<lb break="no"/>tle</w> absolutely necessary. It has therefore, become customary for 
<lb/>travellers to leave a portion of their stores at my house and half of 
<lb/>their Cattle in charge of <persName>Secheli</persName> the Chief of the <term type="tribe">Bakwaians</term>.
<lb/>Both goods and cattle have always been held sacred by the <w>inha-
<lb break="no"/>bitants</w> of the country; and when the town was removed eight 
<lb/>miles from the house they of their own accord placed a guard on the 
<lb/>spot, and every article remained in as much security during my <w>ab-
<lb break="no"/>sence</w> for the last two years, as when present in the house.
<lb/>Guides have always been frankly furnished by <del type="strikethrough">Engl</del><persName>Secheli</persName> to
<lb/>English travellers, and except in the case of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moyle</persName> who did 
<lb/>not return the people given by the Chief to take him to the Colony, 
<lb/>no unpleasantness has ever occurred.</p>
<lb/><p>With the plundering of my house was associated the 
<lb/>destruction of the <placeName><settlement type="town">town of <persName>Secheli</persName></settlement></placeName>, and considerable property <w>de- 
<lb break="no"/>posited</w> there by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Macabe</persName>. The <term type="nationality">Boers</term> were allowed to form 
<lb/>their Camp unmolested before the town. Some of them even 
<lb/>attended divine Service held in the Middle of it on Sunday 
<lb/><date when="1852-01-29">29<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date>; and they informed <persName>Secheli</persName>, that they had come to fight 
<lb/>because the <persName>Queen</persName> had given over the country and people to them 
<lb/>and they would <del type="strikethrough">accomplish</del> abolish Chieftainship. 
<lb/>Considerable stress was <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">also</add> laid on the refusal of <persName>Secheli</persName> to obey 
<lb/>their orders to prevent Englishmen from going to the <placeName><region><w>Lake Coun-
<lb break="no"/>try</w></region></placeName>. (That these orders have been given, I can testify having 
<lb/>seen the documents sent by the <term type="nationality">Boers</term> containing them.) 
<lb/>On <date when="1852-01-30">Monday the 30<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date> the <term type="nationality">Boers</term> commenced their attack
<lb/>by means of swivels, which soon set the town on fire. 
<lb/>The smoke and heat caused much confusion, many of the 
<lb/>women running away were captured and shot. The men 
<lb/>held their position on a small conical hill in the center of 
<lb/>of the town during the whole day, and there being no water 
<lb/>near, both <term type="nationality">Boers</term> and Natives retired when it became dark.</p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000769_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>The numbers of natives killed is upward of sixty; of the <term type="nationality">Boers</term>
<lb/>thirty five; several of both parties have since died of their 
<lb/>wounds, but these are not reckoned in the above numbers
<lb/>The shooting of women was probably accidental, but not so 
<lb/>the capture of children; they reduce them to a state of slavery. 
<lb/>I have seen numerous instances of this in cases of children 
<lb/>taken from other tribes; and have ascertained the facts from 
<lb/>the children themselves in their own language. Among those 
<lb/>captured from the <term type="tribe">Bakwaians</term> are a former wife and two chil<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb/>dren of <persName>Secheli</persName>. In the division of Spoil the Mother and chil-
<lb/>dren were given to different <term type="nationality">Boers</term>. The possession of horses 
<lb/>enabled the Commando to carry off the cattle belonging to the 
<lb/>English travellers before the <term type="tribe">Bakwaians</term> could secure them by 
<lb/>flight. Those of two Native Teachers and my own on which I 
<lb/>trusted for assistance in my Northern Journey shared the same 
<lb/>fate. Th<del type="cancelled">ree</del><add place="above">Three</add> cattle stations belonging to <persName>Secheli</persName> were also 
<lb/>robbed, and the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> and <term type="tribe">Bangwaketse</term> lost all their 
<lb/>cattle. The corn in the country is entirely consumed and the 
<lb/>people have only stealing or starvation in prospect. There is a 
<lb/>probability of a struggle altogether different from any which 
<lb/>has yet taken place in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. I have made careful in-
<lb/>quiries among eight different tribes who have been attacked 
<lb/>by the <term type="nationality">Boers</term> during the last ten years, and also among the <term type="nationality">Boers</term>
<lb/>themselves; But never could discover the loss of a single man 
<lb/>on the side of the latter. In only one instance was a wound in-
<lb/>flicted. The above mentioned engagement<del type="cancelled">s</del> is therefore peculiar 
<lb/>and from the known determination of <persName>Secheli</persName>'s character evinced 
<lb/>in the late skirmish, even after two bullets had pierced his hat 
<lb/>and a third his coat sleeve; makes me fear that the work of 
<lb/>retaliation for a most wanton and unprovoked attack will 
<lb/>be carried on with vigour. The loss of thirty five men will be 
<lb/>peculiarly galling to the <term type="nationality">Boers</term>, inasmuch as while professing to 
<lb/>wish to prevent the trade in guns and gunpowder by Englishmen</p>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000769_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>They are fully aware that much of this slaughter has been in-
<lb/>flicted by weapons which members of their own community 
<lb/>have sold. It is highly probable that those parties of <term type="nationality">Boers</term>
<lb/>who have gone to the <placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake</geogName></placeName> in order to trade in arms and 
<lb/>ammunition will be cut off on their return. <persName>Secheli</persName> has 
<lb/>warned the English travellers to keep apart from them, 
<lb/>and I believe they are quite safe, as the difference between 
<lb/><term type="nationality">Boers</term> and Englishmen is recognized throughout the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>The above facts showing that <del type="strikethrough">a</del><add place="below">^</add><add place="above">the first</add> blow has been 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">and</del> struck by the <term type="nationality">Boers</term>, and that too on a tribe which has ne-
<lb/>ver given them the smallest provocation, not for the last eight 
<lb/>years at least, the slightest trouble to any of its neighbours 
<lb/>are I conceive worthy, of the observation of the government; for 
<lb/>if the policy of the <term type="nationality">Boers</term> takes its usual course; the natives 
<lb/>become exasperated and reckless; gradually learn to fight 
<lb/>well, and then when the <term type="nationality">Boers</term> perceive their real danger 
<lb/>they back out on such contemptible pleas as that of not 
<lb/>being paid by the English government.</p>
