<lb/><p>I now begin a letter to you 
<lb/>after having written to many others from this place 
<lb/>not because I think it necessary for I hope 
<lb/>soon to have viva voce communication with 
<lb/>you, but to ease my conscience of a feeling 
<lb/>that it was not right to make you among the 
<lb/>last. I would not write while in <placeName>Angola</placeName> for 
<lb/><term type="ailment">dysentry</term> reduced me very low then all my 
<lb/>letters maps &amp;c. which were penned in much 
<lb/>weakness went to the bottom in the mail 
<lb/>packet and I had to employ as much of 
<lb/>the time I could spare in returning to <placeName>Cassange</placeName>
<lb/>in repairing that loss. I almost expected 
<lb/>you at <placeName>Loanda</placeName> but not having <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>a single letter from <placeName>England</placeName> while there 
<lb/>though I requested my friends to address to 
<lb/>that city, I suppose you must have 
<lb/>concluded like others that I should never 
<lb/>reach it. I would have been very glad 
<lb/>of your company though from having 
<lb/>been sorely tried by a missionary companion 
<lb/>once, I never feel disposed to despond in 
<lb/>prospect of being alone. <placeName>Londa</placeName> would have 
<lb/>been miserable for you as well as it was 
<lb/>for me. <choice><reg>F</reg><orig>f</orig></choice>or there is no game larger 
<lb/>than mice, not a vulture even not 
<lb/>a crow, and the food is nearly pure starch 
<lb/>Manioc meal and roots with occasionally 
<lb/>that you know as Lobelebele. <choice><orig>t</orig><reg>T</reg></choice>he lower

<lb/>part of the person wetted two or three times 
<lb/>daily in passing streams which are unlike any 
<lb/>I ever saw before. <choice><orig>t</orig><reg>T</reg></choice>he stream itself may be 
<lb/>from 6 to 10 feet broad only but that or more 
<lb/>in depth, and it flows in a marsh of from 
<lb/>100 to 500 yards broad. <choice><orig>t</orig><reg>T</reg></choice>his is covered over 
<lb/>with tufts of grass separated from one to three 
<lb/>or four feet from each other. <choice><orig>t</orig><reg>T</reg></choice>he intervening 
<lb/>spaces are covered with a pellicle of tender water 
<lb/>plants. If you step right on the top of the bunch 
<lb/>of grass, all right but they are often conical 
<lb/>and one steps on the side and down he goes 
<lb/>up to the thigh in soft black slush. <choice><orig>t</orig><reg>T</reg></choice>he oxen 
<lb/>had generally all four legs down at once and how 
<lb/>they got through at all seems quite wonderful. <choice><orig>t</orig><reg>T</reg></choice>he 
<lb/>stream is nothing as it generally had a bridge over 
<lb/>it but the bogs were terrible and delayed us 
<lb/>very much. It is a remarkably well watered 
<lb/>country. Bogs however and forest will prevent 
<lb/>waggons from traversing it anywhere near 
<lb/>our path. On this account I came back 
<lb/>to try this side and you will be glad to 
<lb/>hear I am thus far on my way down. 
<lb/>We reached this a month ago pretty well tired. 
<lb/>I assure you for tsetse destroyed all the oxen 
<lb/>and not having wherewithal to buy a canoe 
<lb/>I had to march on foot. We had plenty 
<lb/>of game all the way and the men killed some 
<lb/>with their <choice><sic>asegais</sic><corr>assegais</corr></choice> I was very unsuccessful 
<lb/>from being unable to steady the gun. I 
<lb/>never saw anything like the numbers 
<lb/>of elephants and buffaloes we had on the 
<lb/>Kafue which is the name of the <placeName>Bashuk 
<lb/>river</placeName> near the confluence, and all wonderfully 
<lb/>tame. Pigs by families stood looking at us 
<lb/>often and lions are so abundant the natives

<w>-<lb break="no"/>morphosed</w> into those animals. The inhabitants
