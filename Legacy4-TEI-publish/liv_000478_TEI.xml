<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Cape Town</placeName> 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1841</p>
<lb/><p><persName ref="#d1e60">R. Owen Esq</persName><hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</p>
<lb/><p>Sir</p>
<lb/><p>I take the liberty to inform you 
<lb/>that yesterday I presented to <persName ref="#d1e71">Colonel Bell</persName> the <persName>Hon<hi rend="sup">le.</hi> Secretary</persName>
<lb/>of the <placeName>Colony</placeName>, your letter respecting the boxes sent out 
<lb/>by the <placeName>College</placeName> for facilitating the collection of anatomical 
<lb/>preparations. And today I received from him the following 
<lb/>note. "<persName ref="#d1e95">Colonel Bell</persName> begs to inform <persName ref="#d1e98">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Livingston</persName> in 
<lb/>reply to his note of yesterday that there are at least 
<lb/>two boxes at <placeName>Gov<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">t</hi></hi> House</placeName> which answer the descrip-î€€
               <!-- hyphen on line below -->tion given by <persName ref="#d1e119"><choice><sic>Proffessor</sic><corr>Professor</corr></choice> Owen</persName>, being addressed to 
<lb/><persName ref="#d1e129">Sir Benjamin D'Urban,</persName> and marked "Glass" 
<lb/>We recommend <persName ref="#d1e134">Mr Livingston</persName> to make application 
<lb/>on the subject to <persName>His Excellency's Private Secretary</persName>
<lb/>at <placeName>Gov<hi rend="sup">t</hi> House </placeName>- presenting at the same time, the 
<lb/><persName><choice><sic>Proffessor's</sic><corr>Professor's</corr></choice></persName> letter which is herewith enclosed for that 
<lb/>purpose" - &amp;c</p>
<lb/><p>I understand there are three of them &amp; as far as 
<lb/>replenishing them is concerned nothing has been 
<lb/>done. This is really too bad but what else can we 
<lb/>expect from those who seem to make money 
<lb/>their chief end of pursuit. Their leisure moments 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000478_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>are devoted to something very different from lending 
<lb/>a hand to the cause of science</p>
<lb/><p>I have do doubt but that I shall be put in 
<lb/>possession of the "cases" And as the mail for <placeName>England</placeName>
<lb/>is made up tonight I lose no time in letting you 
<lb/>know my success, and also the prospect of ultimate 
<lb/>success in obtaining what you wish - I am 
<w>infor-<lb break="no"/>med</w> by those who have travelled extensively through the 
<lb/><placeName>Colony</placeName> that it is by no means uncommon for 
<lb/>the "<term type="tribe">Bushmen</term>" to bring the eggs of ostriches for sale 
<lb/>to the waggons of travellers, and these frequently in a 
<lb/>state of incubation. And I likewise observe great 
<lb/>quantities of the shells for sale in <placeName>Cape Town</placeName>, these 
<lb/>being objects of curiosity for sailors &amp;c &amp;c - <placeName>The Cape</placeName>
<lb/>Ant-Eater is reported to be delicious as food &amp; no doubt 
<lb/>is searched after by the natives on this account 
<lb/>So I suppose by offering a larger price than usual 
<lb/>for the former and placing a sum on the whole 
<lb/>body or only the uteri of the latter, I may soon 
<lb/>succeed in obtaining all we require.</p>
<lb/><p>You may rely upon me that I shall lose no 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough" resp="#CO">unnecessary</del> time unnecessarily but will make every 
<lb/>effort to effect our purpose that may be consistent 
<lb/>with the chief object of my mission to this country 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000478_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>Scientific pursuits are not the end for which I have come 
<lb/>hither, but the evangelization &amp; civilization of the people 
<lb/>and to this I hope to devote most of my engergies.</p>
<lb/><p>While however I make the latter my chief object I mean 
<lb/>to attend a little to the former as a means of relaxation 
<lb/>and if now or at any future time you should wish 
<lb/>anything that can be obtained in my part of the 
<lb/>country. Please, Do not hesitate to make what use 
<lb/>you <del type="strikethrough"><gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="illegible"/></del> choose of my services. A note, addressed 
<lb/><persName ref="#d1e265"><choice><abbr>Rev </abbr><expan>Reverend</expan></choice>D. Livingston,</persName><placeName>Bichuana Country</placeName>: care of <persName ref="#d1e276"><choice><abbr>Rev.</abbr><expan>Reverend</expan></choice> A. 
<lb/>Robson,</persName><placeName>Port Elizabeth, Algoa Bay, S.A.</placeName> and handed 
<lb/>into the Mission House, Blomfield <choice><abbr>St. </abbr><expan>Street</expan></choice>to any of the 
<lb/>Secretaries, will in due time reach me -</p>
<lb/><p>I have been longer in my passage hither than I at <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/>
<lb/>anticipated. The delay having been caused by the splitting 
<lb/>of one of our masts which obliged us to put into 
<lb/>Rio De Janeiro to refit. The same accident detains 
<lb/>me here and if we go on at this slow rate, I do 
<lb/>not see that we can reach <placeName ref="#d1e315">Lattakoo</placeName> in much 
<lb/>less than 4 months from this date. The length of time 
<lb/>which must elapse before I can transmit the boxes 
<lb/>down to the coast is rather discouraging but I earnestly 
<lb/>hope to get one of them replenished before I pass the 
<lb/>boundary of the Colony in which case I suppose it
