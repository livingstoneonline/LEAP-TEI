<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Shupanga</placeName> 15<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> May 1862</p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>In prospect of our Johanna 
<lb/>men leaving in the end of February and our 
<lb/>soon getting up to the cataracts I took two 
<lb/>quartermasters <persName>Thomas Magrath</persName> &amp; <persName>George 
<lb/>Wheatcroft</persName> from the <term type="boat">Gorgon</term> for the <term type="boat">Lady 
<lb/>Nyassa</term> and one leading stoker <persName>James 
<lb/>King</persName> with one 1<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> class stoker <persName>Michael 
<lb/>Nolan</persName> - also one ordinary seaman.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Whitehead</persName> believing that they 
<lb/>would be necessary for the safety of 
<lb/>the vessel till fresh Johanna men 
<lb/>for whom I have applied to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Sunley</persName> H. M. Consul should arrive. 
<lb/>I considered that we could scarcely 
<lb/>get on in the transport of the sections 
<lb/>without some men on whom we 
<lb/>could depend. With a view to aid 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> in any breakages that might 
<lb/>occur in the overland passage I took 
<lb/><persName>William Macleod</persName> an excellent smith 
<lb/>and <persName>Augustus Waldman</persName> a cooper 
<lb/>civilians on the passage to the Cape 
<lb/>i.e. seven whites instead of six 
<lb/>Johanna men. The latter we have 
<lb/>been unable to send away though they 
<lb/>were to serve but one year as a trial 
<lb/>but we expect a ship after 20<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> currt to 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> them<reg>.</reg></p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001780_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/><p>In consequence of our long detention 
<lb/>down in the lowlands and the fact that 
<lb/>some of the men have in spite of everything 
<lb/>got vile Portuguese spirits we have had 
<lb/>an unusual amount of sickness and 
<lb/>the smallest quantity of work as the 
<lb/>result. <persName>Wheatcroft</persName> an inveterate old 
<lb/>drunkard 
<lb/>was disrated by <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> before he 
<lb/>left, and for <choice><sic>drunkeness</sic><corr>drunkenness</corr></choice> and most disgusting 
<lb/>language 
<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName> I reduced him to single 
<lb/>pay, and will hand him over to the next 
<lb/>ship that calls. <persName>Nolan</persName> - always sick &amp; 
<lb/>useless when for a day or so he is put off 
<lb/>the list - has never done well in any 
<lb/>ship he has been in. He must go with 
<lb/><persName>Wheatcroft</persName>.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>David Gwilliam</persName> our other Quartermaster 
<lb/>has been a most useful hardworking 
<lb/>man - has had very fair health and never 
<lb/>spared himself but got drink and as 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName> compelled <persName>King</persName> always to 
<lb/>remain in attendance on him doing 
<lb/>anything or nothing. <persName>Gwilliam</persName> like an 
<lb/>old fool used foul language to <persName>Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>by way of standing up for the oppressed - 
<lb/>used foul and disgusting epithets and 
<lb/>took hold of <persName>Hardisty</persName> by the beard. <persName>H.</persName>
<lb/>very naturally struck him to free himself 
<lb/>the evidence is quite conclusive against 
<lb/><persName>Gwilliam</persName> and I am obliged to hand 
<lb/>him off as the Captain may advise for 
<lb/>court martial. I am sorry to part with 
<lb/>him as away from drink he is invaluable<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001780_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><persName>John Hutchins</persName> Q<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Master has been a long 
<lb/>time with us &amp; generally very well behaved 
<lb/>but he has had dysentery twice the last time so severely that though is working 
<lb/>and active medical opinion says it 
<lb/>will not be just to the man to keep 
<lb/>him longer. He must be invalided<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>William Rowe</persName> has been leading stoker 
<lb/>and storekeeper - drove the <term type="boat">Ma Robert</term>
<lb/>after <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> left and kept our stores 
<lb/>with the strictest honesty. His services 
<lb/>have been very valuable. When <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>May</persName> came with the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> I hoped 
<lb/>to follow my work chiefly on shore 
<lb/>while <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> M.</persName> did what could be done in 
<lb/>the ship. I looked to <persName>Rowe</persName> to manage 
<lb/>our domestic affairs ashore and 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>tinued</w> the storekeeper's salary of Â£150 
<lb/>with that view. Now, that a person 
<lb/>of his probity would be extremely 
<lb/>serviceable to us at either the upper 
<lb/>or lower end of the cataracts I am 
<lb/>sorry to find that he wishes to go home 
<lb/>I don<reg>'</reg>t think it well to detain him. His 
<lb/>time in the navy is nearly out and he 
<lb/>complains of a pain in his side from 
<lb/>a pleurisy long before he came to us. 
<lb/>He offers to come out when free 
<lb/>from the navy but I shall not require 
<lb/>him then.</p>
<lb/><p>If the Johanna men come we 
<lb/>shall get on very well without <persName>Wheatcroft</persName>

<lb/><persName>Nolan</persName> and <persName>Waldman</persName> - but two 
<lb/>Quartermasters seem to be necessary 
<lb/>instead of <persName>Gwilliam</persName> and <persName>Hutchins</persName>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> says a common stoker will 
<lb/>serve him as well as <persName>Rowe</persName>. We shall 
<lb/>part with <persName>Whitehead</persName> too to reduce 
<lb/>the Europeans as low as possible 
<lb/>the Johanna <add place="above">men</add> never get fever. We 
<lb/>never had so much insubordination 
<lb/>as <add place="above">during</add> these last three months - and it is 
<lb/>quite inexcusable as <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName>
<lb/>is a thorough disciplinarian and 
<lb/>looks sharply after them. I 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>plained</w> to the Governor of Quillimane 
<lb/>about the Portuguese officer at 
<lb/><placeName>Kongone</placeName> converting what his 
<lb/>Government calls a custom 
<lb/>house into a grog shop, and he 
<lb/>reprimanded him and referred the 
<lb/>case to the Governor General of 
<lb/>Mosambique.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Magrath</persName> promises to turn out a 
<lb/>very good man and so does <persName>Goldsmith</persName>
<lb/>who exchanged with <persName>John Neil</persName><persName>A. B. 
<lb/>Macleod</persName> the smith is a capital 
<lb/>mechanic and a good steady man 
<lb/>and <persName>John Reid</persName> is equally deserving 
<lb/>no one ever took anything like the amount 
<lb/>of labour off my hands as <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName>. </p>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001780_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
<lb/><p>I mentioned in a letter which went 
<lb/>by the <term type="boat">Gorgon</term> in April the strange turn in 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty's</persName> conduct, and foresaw 
<lb/>that he would make himself as disagreeable 
<lb/>as possible till he got away. It was so 
<lb/>different from his previous mode of 
<lb/>working that I felt confounded by it. It is 
<lb/>all plain now, you had <choice><sic>gauranteed</sic><corr>guaranteed</corr></choice> him 
<lb/>for twelve months only, but forgot to let me 
<lb/>know. At the end of that time he had 
<lb/>allowed the engines to go thoroughly out of 
<lb/>repair &amp; wished to have done with them. 
<lb/>Instead of telling me so, he tried to provoke 
<lb/>me by impertinence at table before <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Wilson</persName> <add place="above">&amp; his officers</add> - going quite out of his way even, 
<lb/>to contradict me when he was taking no other 
<lb/>part in the conversation. I took no notice 
<lb/>of it, except as I told you, agreeing with 
<lb/>the captain<reg>'</reg>s wish to tell the Admiral &amp; let him 
<lb/>send another engineer. Well, hoping to be 
<lb/>soon out of the delta I gladly accepted the 
<lb/>help offered by the officers of the <term type="boat">Gorgon</term> to 
<lb/>lead &amp; help us up the cataracts <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Hardisty</persName> said that ten tons of coals were 
<lb/>sufficient for our purpose - but unknown 
<lb/>to me had the feed pump broken in 
<lb/>January, and he had two men pumping 
<lb/>in cold water into the boilers in February. 
<lb/>This caused a great waste of fuel - till 
<lb/>seeing <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> H.</persName> lying asleep on the Engine 
<lb/>skylight I asked what was the matter with 
<lb/>the engines that we could not go more than 
<lb/>1/2 a mile an hour - "It<reg>'</reg>s the list over" said 
<lb/>he and soon after went into the <add place="above">sick</add> list - 
<lb/>saying to <persName>Meller</persName> I think I am going to have fever. 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001780_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/>I asked <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> to go down and he soon made 
<lb/>her speed increase, mended the pump pin 
<lb/>which was broken in about three hours 
<lb/>and saved the poor fellows the unmerciful 
<lb/>toil of pumping. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> has told me 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">since I found</hi> out the state of the engines 
<lb/>that he never in his life saw engines 
<lb/>in a worse state. The packing 
<lb/>in the different parts had never been renewed, 
<lb/>and the nuts were screwed home. "He 
<lb/>did not like to interfere"<reg>.</reg> Well we were 
<lb/>seventeen days down at the sea during 
<lb/>the whole of which time <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>did absolutely nothing. We towed out 
<lb/>the brig <term type="boat">Hetty Ellen</term>, and when on the middle 
<lb/>of the bar the engines failed us for a 
<lb/>time and we were nearly in the breakers. 
<lb/>When we returned he took off the cover 
<lb/>of the <del type="strikethrough">condenser</del> <add place="above">air pump</add> and going down on the 
<lb/>Inspection day I saw the plunger packing 
<lb/>covered with 1/4 inch sand all coloured 
<lb/>green by rubbing on the inside of the brass 
<lb/>cylinder. It <add place="above">namely the inside of the air pump <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/></add> was grievously worn away. 
<lb/>The <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/> had not been packed 
<lb/>for 20 months, and air had been 
<lb/>sucked in instead of water - the consequence 
<lb/>was the old packing was like tinder and 
<lb/>had to be picked out with a knife, 
<lb/>and the India rubber valves were burned 
<lb/>curled up and would not act. No 
<lb/>wonder then we could not get away 
<lb/>from the Delta - <add place="above"><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/>In <unclear cert="low">time</unclear></add> I loaded her rather 
<lb/>more heavily than when we took three 
<lb/>weeks to get up to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName>, and we 
<lb/>went up in three days. She drew 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001780_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/>over five feet too. We went down again 
<lb/>and took all the remaining things of the <del type="strikethrough">Pione</del>
<lb/><term type="boat">Lady Nyassa</term> - were again as deep and 
<lb/>had <add place="above">purposely</add> a list too from using one bunker's 
<lb/>coals exclusively for a while. We did 
<lb/>the distance in three days of ten hours 
<lb/>each and but for the loss of a good 
<lb/>half day by searching for a passage 
<lb/>where the channel had changed, would 
<lb/>have done it in about 24 hours steaming<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The ten tons of coals were expended in the 
<lb/>first case when we were a little over 
<lb/>half the distance to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> - then the 
<lb/>expense of purchasing wood - and 
<lb/>cutting it was enormous for we had 
<lb/>to send up to <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> for our fuel 
<lb/>&amp; hire canoes to bring it down. Four 
<lb/>months in the Delta where we should 
<lb/>not have been more than a week 
<lb/>has entailed an unusual amount of 
<lb/>sickness upon us. Fever &amp; dysentery 
<lb/>have never left us till now, but 
<lb/>fortunately with no fatality except 
<lb/>that which has darkened all my 
<lb/>horizon. I have said nothing nor 
<lb/>will I say aught of harshness to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Hardisty</persName>. He behaved well up to the 
<lb/>time that unknown to me he felt 
<lb/>himself unequal to managing the 
<lb/>Engines. He never had charge 
<lb/>before except as a third Engineer in 
<lb/>the navy.</p>
<lb/><p>If we had not ran aground in 
<lb/>January the sand would not have 
<lb/>got in then - the fault may therefore 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001780_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'-->
<lb/>be traced to what cannot be avoided 
<lb/>in a river where the channel shifts 
<lb/>but the pump ought on touching to be 
<lb/>disconnected at once, and the boiler 
<lb/>supplied by the donkey engine. Instead 
<lb/>of which the pump was allowed to 
<lb/>work till it was choked by sand &amp; 
<lb/>broke - <add place="above">the donkey E. being idle</add>. Then as <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> H.</persName> said the sand 
<lb/>would work itself out of the <del type="strikethrough">condenser</del> <add place="above">air pump</add>
<lb/>but instead of taking it out himself 
<lb/>he allowed the materials to be worn 
<lb/>and damaged. I trust you will not 
<lb/>consider me wrong in letting him 
<lb/>go. With him it is a perpetual attempt 
<lb/>to thwart <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName> by keeping the 
<lb/>engine stokers away from every 
<lb/>other work. When we are going he 
<lb/>stalks about the deck the whole day, 
<lb/>&amp; never goes below to the Engines - 
<lb/>and while I write he sits washing 
<lb/>his clothes. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> ill of dysentery 
<lb/>and the <term type="boat">Lady Nyassa</term> standing still 
<lb/>though nearly ready for launching - 
<lb/>the four stokers kept out of the way 
<lb/>doing I know not what. A parcel 
<lb/>of tools was bought by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> James 
<lb/>Young</persName> of Glasgow &amp; sent to the 
<lb/><term type="boat">Pioneer</term> for <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName>. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> H.</persName> will 
<lb/>not lend them even. I am not 
<lb/>disposed to quarrel with anyone 
<lb/>but I feel it rather hard to have the 
<lb/>work hindered in this way. I am &amp;</p>
