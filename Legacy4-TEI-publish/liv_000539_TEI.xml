<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kuruman</placeName> 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 1843 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Brother in Christ</p>
<lb/><p>Since I have been permitted in the 
<lb/>kind Providence of our merciful Redeemer to enter the missionary 
<lb/>field I have often felt the duties connected with that precious 
<lb/>privilege towards the bretheren at home. We in our sphere 
<lb/>of labour ought to endeavour to furnish you with 
<w>infor-<lb break="no"/>mation</w> whereby your sympathies in the blessed cause may 
<lb/>be enlarged, your zeal increased &amp; your thanksgivings 
<lb/>caused to abound. But with respect to this duty I feel I 
<lb/>have come very far short &amp; more especially with respect 
<lb/>to you. I believe I have written all the deacons with whom 
<lb/>I was more particularly acquainted &amp; now I don't well know 
<lb/>how to excuse the ommission of you among the number<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I might urge the usual plea in such cases of having had 
<lb/>good intentions but that would scarcely satisfy myself 
<lb/>I shall therefore in this give you some account of the 
<lb/>manner in which I have been employed and if you see 
<lb/>in that cause to excuse me I shall try to do better in future<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The best news I could give you would be that I had 
<lb/>been instrumental in converting sinners, this however 
<lb/>I cannot give for I have been employed chiefly in the 
<lb/>work of preparation. You are perhaps aware that 
<lb/>when sent out, our Directors instructed us to remain 
<lb/>at<placeName> Kuruman</placeName><choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> the arrival of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>. No one 
<lb/>else having much local knowledge of the country it was 
<lb/>thought desirable that we should be employed in acquiring 
<lb/>the language &amp;c. <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> he should come &amp; assist us in 
<lb/>choosing a proper site for a new mission. I did 
<lb/>not however find the language such a formidable 
<lb/>affair as was expected &amp; very soon set off to gain 
<lb/>a local knowledge for myself. To this object I 
<lb/>conjoined others such as a more through acquaintance 
<lb/>with the tongue than can be got by sitting with one 
<lb/>tribe or section of the people. Doing good by means <supplied resp="#CO">of</supplied>

<lb/>native teachers &amp;c. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he prosecution of these has led me very 
<lb/>far into the interior. Farther than has been reached by any 
<lb/>other European so that I can gratefully say I have preached 
<lb/>the gospel beyond every other man's line of things. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>Directors have expressed their cordial approbation of the 
<lb/>steps I took &amp; have instructed us to proceed immediately 
<lb/>on the knowledge of the interior I have acquired &amp; form 
<lb/>a new settlement, the <del type="strikethrough">site</del><add place="above"> location</add> will be in sight of what 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName> called the Kurrichane range. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he good 
<lb/>man longed to have a mission established there and no 
<lb/>fewer than seven of the bretheren have been sent out 
<lb/>with appointments to that part of the country<reg>.</reg> But 
<lb/>circumstances have always prevented the accomplishment 
<lb/>of his wish. Of the seven only one <persName>(M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards)</persName> has 
<lb/>seen the place of his appointment &amp; in his case it is 
<lb/>after a residence of 20 years in the country. I have 
<lb/>no doubt but you will be glad to hear that a prospect 
<lb/>of a permanent settlement is now before us. In 
<lb/>two or three days <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><unclear cert="low">E</unclear></persName> &amp; I expect to be on our 
<lb/>way to erect huts on the spot chosen.</p>
<lb/><p>After hearing of our cheering prospects as to a settlement 
<lb/>on one part of the interior you may perhaps be anxious 
<lb/>to know our prospects for the whole continent. Well 
<lb/>I cannot say they are bright, there seems a cloud over 
<lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName> &amp; that seems to be composed of its pestilential 
<lb/><term type="ailment">malaria</term>. This portion of the continent now the most 
<lb/>healthy would if we had somewhat more rain be one 
<lb/>of the most unhealthy in this world. Our immense sandy 
<lb/>plains would be swamps. Indeed there is abundance of 
<lb/>evidence that at no very distant date they were in 
<lb/>reality so, &amp; even now when a little moisture <unclear cert="low"> exists</unclear>
<lb/>than usual fevers are sure to break out. Fevers 
<lb/>seem to be the great barrier to the civilization of <placeName>Africa</placeName>
<lb/><unclear cert="low"><del type="strikethrough">beyond us</del></unclear>. There is a lake called <placeName>Mokhoro</placeName> or of the 
<lb/>canoe about 200 miles beyond my farthest point 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000539_0003"/><!--pb/@n='123r'-->
<lb/>north. It has never been seen by a white man but there 
<lb/>can be no doubt of its existence. It stretches from the 
<lb/>N. E. to the South West, and all the country around is a 
<lb/>dead level. Fevers abound so much there one of the 
<lb/>chiefs of the Bangwaketze called <unclear cert="medium">Sebegwe</unclear> lost so 
<lb/>many of his men by them he had not a sufficiency 
<lb/>to take care of his cattle. Last year a native 
<lb/>who travelled with me was affected by it &amp; after all my 
<lb/>care &amp; labour with him he carries its effects about with 
<lb/>him yet. This lake is a barrier to the North West 
<lb/>&amp; North East, the <placeName>Bakalahari desert</placeName> to the West &amp; 
<lb/>the <placeName><unclear cert="low">De Sagoa Bay</unclear></placeName> fevers to the East are a stronger 
<lb/>barrier to the boers from the colony than all the 
<lb/>acts of parliament can rear. A little to the North 
<lb/>East of our to be station there is a peculiar fly 
<lb/>which bites the oxen &amp; the first rain that falls 
<lb/>afterwards proves fatal to them all. We who are 
<lb/>almost entirely dependent on these<add place="above"> oxen</add> for conveyance 
<lb/>fear the fly as we do fevers. Some traders have 
<lb/>been left without an ox to drag their waggon 
<lb/>back again. It is said <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> intends visiting 
<lb/>the <placeName>Lake Mokhoro</placeName> or <placeName>Botletli</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat is the best road 
<lb/>one could take if he wished to explore the interior 
<lb/>as there are canoes on it &amp; many tribes reside on its 
<lb/>banks<reg>.</reg> But the fevers. I hope he may return in 
<lb/>safety. It will however be impossible to establish 
<lb/>a mission near it now. White men could not live 
<lb/>there &amp; we have no blacks who could be trusted far 
<lb/>from missionaries. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here are none sufficiently 
<lb/>enlightened or disinterested to carry on a mission by 
<lb/>themselves. But we may yet find them. We Europeans 
<lb/>could go as well as natives but in their most feverish 
<lb/>places, the sun is so scorching we should be of very 
<lb/>little use. May the Lord open up the way for us &amp; 
<lb/>for the success of the blessed cause<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>I think nothing has struck my mind more forcibly in this 
<lb/>country than the necessity of the Holy Spirit<reg>'</reg>s influences in <del type="strikethrough">to</del> the 
<lb/>work of conversion. At home I felt it But here no 
<lb/>sooner do we become intimately acquainted with the 
<lb/>character of the people than the mind is overwhelmingly 
<lb/>convinced that without Divine aid nothing can be done 
<lb/>with them. This makes me entreat in earnest prayer 
<lb/>of all my friends, I entreat yours not that I have any 
<lb/>doubt but that if the truth is presented in the proper manner 
<lb/>His influences will be withheld<reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Lord delights to bless, I 
<lb/>may not however exhibit the truth in the proper form 
<lb/>&amp; this constitutes a source of great anxiety, I feel that 
<lb/>I might live all my life here &amp; do nothing to advance the 
<lb/>period when the Redeemer shall see of the travail 
<lb/>of his soul &amp; be satisfied. I implore then your 
<lb/>prayers that I may be made wise to win souls. If you 
<lb/>have any suggestions on that subject I shall take it 
<lb/>kind if you make them. I rejoice to hear of the 
<lb/>success which has attended your labours. <choice><reg>M</reg><orig>m</orig></choice>ay you 
<lb/>be still more abundantly successful &amp; may yours be the 
<lb/>portion of those that turn many to righteousness.</p>
<lb/><p>We have great difficulty in conveying truth to <unclear cert="low">mind</unclear>
<lb/>of these heathen in the fact that all our theological 
<lb/>terms are newly coined, &amp; sometimes these are far from 
<lb/>being adopted to convey the ideas. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he word <add place="above">for instance</add> adopted in the 
<lb/>testament for holiness &amp; sanctification is that which 
<lb/>is made use of when a man sees a nice fat ox or cow. 
<lb/>Beauty is nearest the word in our language although not 
<lb/>that exactly. Other words have two meanings so if we 
<lb/>don<reg>'</reg>t take pains perpetually to explain which we mean 
<lb/>we are quite misapprehanded. When speaking of Sin 
<lb/>&amp; using one word to designate it we may be understood 
<lb/>as talking of pieces of dried <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/> cows ordure 
<lb/>which are <unclear cert="low">used</unclear> as bull<reg>.</reg> But when the truth takes 
<lb/>hold of the heart they never mistake, and it is remarked 
<lb/>in this country that there are as many of the old converted 
<lb/>as of the young I believe this is different from what 
<lb/>occurs where people have had the <unclear cert="low">corpus</unclear> from infancy &amp;

<lb/>I am very sorry to hear of some disagreeable circumstances 
<lb/>which have transpired and that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moir</persName> has thought 
<lb/>proper to implicate me in this affair. My memory 
<lb/>does not serve me either positively to contradict or 
<lb/>affirm, but my father having been my only 
<w>inform-<lb break="no"/>ant</w> on this subject I have sent an extract from 
<lb/>his letter to me at the time it happened which 
<lb/>will completely exculpate him. <hi rend="underline">I remember 
<lb/>distinctly that I was not the first who introduced 
<lb/>the subject<reg>.</reg> He <add place="above"><persName>Mr Moir</persName></add> knew perfectly well</hi> that a meeting 
<lb/>had been called &amp; the subject of it too before he 
<lb/>saw me - The fact that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> M</persName>. left on the last 
<lb/>sabbath in church and that he did not see me in 
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName><choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> about the middle of May seems 
<lb/>presumptive evidence that he must have heard 
<lb/>of it. I always disapproved of his conduct in 
<lb/>that affair. When I saw him in <placeName>London</placeName> my 
<lb/>conviction was he had come on a most unfortunate 
<lb/>speculation<reg>.</reg> I cannot conceive what motive I 
<lb/>could have had, in making such a statement as 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> M</persName>. puts into my mouth. Feeling as I have 
<lb/>always done that there is the closest relationship 
<lb/>between me &amp; my parent I can <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> of nothing 
<lb/>but idiotcy which could have induced me to say 
<lb/>to one whom I might be sure would make use 
<lb/>of my words that my father put his name to a 
<lb/>note of censure which in his heart he did not 
<lb/>approve. These considerations make me believe 
<lb/>&amp; I should like to say it in a Christian spirit that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Moir</persName> is surely in error<reg>.</reg></p><addSpan spanTo="#p122r-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fos.122r, 122v, 123r'--></addSpan>
