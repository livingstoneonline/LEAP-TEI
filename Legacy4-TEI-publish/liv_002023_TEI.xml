<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Poonah</placeName> 18<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> June 1864 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Sir Roderick</persName></p>
<lb/><p>We arrived at <placeName>Bombay</placeName> on the 
<lb/>13<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> current after a passage of forty four 
<lb/>days from <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>, and very 
<w>thank-<lb break="no"/>ful</w> I feel to be again on solid ground. 
<lb/>From <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> we went along the 
<lb/><placeName>African coast</placeName> for the sake of the 
<lb/>help of a current of at least one 
<lb/>hundred miles a day. If <persName>Solomon's</persName>
<lb/>ships went down to <placeName><choice><sic>Sofalla</sic><corr>Sofala</corr></choice>,</placeName> as some 
<lb/>suppose, they could not have done 
<lb/>it <add place="above">against this current</add> in the South West Monsoon. 
<lb/>We went along beautifully till we 
<lb/>got past the Line then fell into a 
<lb/>calm region which <persName>Captain Maury</persName>
<lb/>places south of the Equator. Altogether 
<lb/>we had 24 1/2 days calm, the sea as 
<lb/>smooth as glass, and as we had 
<lb/>but one stoker with us we could 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002023_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>not steam more than nine or ten hours 
<lb/>at a time. By patience &amp; perseverance 
<lb/>we have at last got over our 2500 
<lb/>miles - but I now feel at as great a 
<lb/>loss as ever. I came here to sell the 
<lb/>steamer but with that comes the idea 
<lb/>of giving up <placeName>Africa</placeName> before 
<w>accom-<lb break="no"/>plishing</w> something against the slave trade<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The thought of it makes me actually feel 
<lb/>as if I could not lie in my grave 
<lb/>in peace with all the evils I know 
<lb/>going on. That which makes it doubly 
<lb/>galling is the fact that while <persName>Lord 
<lb/>Palmerston's </persName>policy has, to a very 
<lb/>gratifying extent, been successful on 
<lb/>the <placeName>West Coast</placeName> - The same measures 
<lb/>have been in operation here - the same 
<lb/><add place="above">expense and</add> same dangers incurred - the same 
<lb/>heroic services performed by H M 
<lb/>cruizers on this coast, and all has been 
<lb/>rendered ineffectual by dirty dribble

<lb/>who by no means represent either 
<lb/>the best or half best of the statesmen 
<lb/>of <placeName>Lisbon.</placeName><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he country is to be shut

<lb/>repressive measures will continue 
<lb/>fruitless. 
<lb/>I would willingly have 
<lb/>gone up some of the rivers instead 
<lb/>of coming here - but I had only three 
<lb/>white men - a stoker - a sailor 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">and</del> a carpenter; and seven Zambesians<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The sailor &amp; stoker had severe illnesses 
<lb/>in the way and it would have been 
<lb/>imprudent to go up a strange river 
<lb/>as the Juba - - - 
<lb/>so short handed. The two men 
<lb/>named had moreover volunteered 
<lb/>to accompany me to <placeName>Bombay</placeName> though 
<lb/>they had served some years with us <choice><reg/><orig>.</orig></choice>

<lb/><add place="above">already</add> so it would not have been right to have 
<lb/>drawn them elsewhere. Our engineer 
<lb/>left at <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> for a situation on 
<lb/>a sugar plantation, and I had either to 
<lb/>run the risk of a pretty long voyage in 
<lb/>the little <term type="boat">Lady of Nyassa</term> or wait at 
<lb/><placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> till the monsoon changes in 
<lb/>Autumn. She is a first rate little seaboat 
<lb/>and rose on the huge waves of the Bay 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">of Bengal</del> <add place="above">Indian ocean</add> like a little duck - but she 
<lb/>was not intended for sailing. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he sails 
<lb/>are very simple and the screws drag in 
<lb/>the water as if we had another boat in 
<lb/>tow. </p>
<lb/><p>I have some hesitation too because 
<lb/>the <persName>Baron Van der Decken</persName> intends to 
<lb/>explore the rivers. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut my object is not 
<lb/>so much exploration as to set in train 
<lb/>operations by merchants &amp; others which 
<lb/>shall eventually work out the slave trade. 
<lb/>I would not forestall him or do anything 
<lb/>dishonourable and I wish I had five 
<lb/>minutes conversation with you about 
<lb/>it. The Mission of the Universities was a 
<lb/>sore disappointment to me. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey have all
