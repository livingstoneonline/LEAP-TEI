<lb/><p>On the morning of 23<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> about 2A.M. 
<lb/>we deemed that we drew near 
<lb/>to <placeName>Mohilla</placeName> though no land was 
<lb/>visible the day before and 
<lb/>wished for the day as a 
<lb/>heavy sea was running - We 
<lb/>lay to as sailors say that is 
<lb/>bring the edges of the sails as 
<lb/>near the wind as possible 
<lb/>little sail in front and one 
<lb/>large one behind so the ship does 
<lb/>not go but leans over to the 
<lb/>wind. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> rose like a 
<lb/>little duck over the huge waves 
<lb/>and we stood peering through 
<lb/>the gloom and when day dawned 
<lb/><placeName>Mohilla</placeName> lay before us and 
<lb/>sailing round it we anchored

<lb/>off the fort of the Queen. Soon a 
<lb/>canoe came off with outriggers to 
<lb/>keep it from being upset by the 
<lb/>waves and our old friend <persName>Abdullah</persName>
<lb/>came to welcome us. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his will 
<lb/>give an idea of a canoe with 
<lb/>one out rigger. <figure><!--<graphic style="float:left" url="LETT1384-1.gif"/>--></figure> Two sticks are 
<lb/>tied across the canoe and 
<lb/>then a flat piece to their ends 
<lb/>this keeps it from over 
<lb/>turning. Sometimes there are two 
<lb/>one on each side of the canoe. We 
<lb/>have a mongoose on board 
<lb/>a very funny little beast 
<lb/>shaped like a rat. We did not 
<lb/>know that it took any notice 
<lb/>of people but as soon as 
<lb/>the strangers came on board 
<lb/>with <persName>Abdullah</persName> he ran and tried 
<lb/>to bite their feet as if to say 
<lb/>What business have you in

<lb/>my ship<choice><reg>?</reg><orig>.</orig></choice> The Queen gave us 
<lb/>a bullock in a present and 
<lb/>we went and called on her - but 
<lb/>saw only a part of her face 
<lb/>as she had on what is called 
<lb/>the yasmak which covers 
<lb/>the nose and cheeks. Her 
<lb/>two children had patches of 
<lb/>medicine on their faces I 
<lb/>suppose from a superstitious 
<lb/>fear of the evil eye. I asked 
<lb/><gap extent="5" unit="words" agent="damage"/><add place="above" hand="#hand01">then to put some on</add> my 
<lb/>face <gap extent="3" unit="words" agent="damage"/><add place="inline" hand="#hand01">but the Queen's</add> husband<reg>,</reg>
<lb/>an ugly old man<reg>,</reg> said laughing 
<lb/>it is only for little children<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We took a walk yesterday 
<lb/>25<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> up the hill - saw lots of 
<lb/>bats as large as half grown 
<lb/>kittens. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are called flying foxes<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001839_0004"/><!--pb/@n='107v'-->
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are of a golden yellow colour 
<lb/>on the neck breast &amp; back &amp; 
<lb/>the head is shaped like a <choice><sic>foxe's</sic><corr>fox's</corr></choice> head<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have eaten them and thought 
<lb/>them good - but at present we 
<lb/>have the queen's ox - and dont 
<lb/>care for bats or such like vermin<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We are now 26<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> steaming to 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna</placeName> where this will be 
<lb/>left for transmission to you.
