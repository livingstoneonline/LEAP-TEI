<lb/><p>(I)</p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Murchison's Cataract</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Oct<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 1859</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>W</reg><orig>w</orig></choice>e have traced this 
<lb/>river up to its point of departure from 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Nyinyesi</placeName> or as we heard it 
<lb/>called there <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> and found 
<lb/>that there are only thirty miles <add place="above">(say 33)</add> of 
<lb/>cataract and the river is placid 
<lb/>up to 14º 25′ S. where <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>
<lb/>begins. We abandoned our intention 
<lb/>of going up the <placeName>Ruo</placeName> when we 
<lb/>found  that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird's</persName> precious 
<lb/>Punt was in a sinking state: 
<lb/>Funnel, Furnace, Deck &amp; 
<lb/>Bottom went shaky simultaneously 
<lb/>so it would have been unadvisable 
<lb/>to be encamped near the border 
<lb/>tribes about <placeName>Ruo</placeName>. We came on to 
<lb/><persName>Chibisa's</persName> taking nearly a month 
<lb/>to do what an ordinary steamer 
<lb/>would have done &amp; what we can 
<lb/>do (with the current) in three 
<lb/>days. We proceeded over land 
<lb/>to <placeName>Zomba</placeName> &amp; then descended 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001470_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>into the <placeName>Shire</placeName> valley &amp; followed the river 
<lb/>up to the <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. It was the hottest 
<lb/>season of the year - the "smokes" from 
<lb/>the burning of thousands of acres 
<lb/>of tall grass = a broiling hot London 
<lb/>fog if you can imagine such a 
<lb/>thing. We were 37 in all <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName><reg>,</reg><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>C. Livingstone</persName>, <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> &amp; 33 <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>
<lb/>all were delighted with the country &amp; no 
<lb/>wonder for it is mountainous &amp; 
<lb/>every few miles we had streams of 
<lb/>delicious cool water. It was Londa 
<lb/>again. A great deal of cotton is cultivated 
<lb/>and indeed the Lake region opens up 
<lb/>the finest cotton &amp; sugar country in the 
<lb/>world. Remember please when I 
<lb/>say so that I invariably discouraged 
<lb/>the formation of any company or 
<lb/>other speculation, but the time 
<lb/>has come when with calm deliberation 
<lb/>I can say there is a glorious prospect 
<lb/>for both Africa and England. No 
<lb/>matter what you have done there is 
<lb/>now an opportunity for you doing 
<lb/>more than ever, for, the two Lakes 
<lb/><placeName>Shirwa</placeName> (which means simply - <del type="strikethrough">(</del>Great 
<lb/>water) or <placeName>Tamandua</placeName> and 
<lb/><placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName> or <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> lie parallel to 
<lb/>the East coast and all the slave 
<lb/>trade of <placeName>Anghozia</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Mosambique</placeName>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001470_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>from the Interior crosses these Lakes 
<lb/>or rather crosses <placeName>Shire</placeName> and then goes 
<lb/>along the partition between them - <placeName>Tamandua</placeName>
<lb/>extreme length is about 90 miles 
<lb/><placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName> no one could tell more than 
<lb/>after months to the North it turned 
<lb/>round into the sea. We met a 
<lb/>large slaving party from <placeName>Cazembe<reg>'</reg>s</placeName>
<lb/>country &amp; bought fine specimens of 
<lb/>Malachite from them. When they 
<lb/>knew we were English they evaporated 
<lb/>by night<reg>.</reg> They had a great many 
<lb/>slaves and elephants<reg>'</reg> tusks. Now 
<lb/>lawful commerce would eat out 
<lb/>that traffic ere long, but it must 
<lb/>be untrammelled by Portuguese 
<lb/>restrictions and I now give you 
<lb/>the points about which you will 
<lb/>probably be consulted.</p>
<lb/><p>The <placeName>Kongone</placeName> or as it is sometimes 
<lb/>called <placeName>Nyangalüe</placeName> was quite unknown 
<lb/>to the Portuguese and lately when we 
<lb/>went down to meet the "Persian" slaves 
<lb/>were sent to follow &amp; report on 
<lb/>where we had found a navigable 
<lb/>bar. This though we had given 
<lb/>plans of it they knew <placeName>Melambe</placeName>
<lb/>six miles west of it but not <placeName>Kongone</placeName><reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001470_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>Then, the Governor General of <placeName>Mosambique</placeName>
<lb/>sent for a half cast called <persName>Paul Mariano</persName>
<lb/>a few months ago to ask him if the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> really entered the sea at the 
<lb/><placeName>Luabo</placeName>! &amp; shewed him my map. And 
<lb/>again a slave from <placeName>Senna</placeName> our 
<lb/>interpreter in last journey was sent 
<lb/>for to <placeName>Mosambique</placeName> to be pumped by 
<lb/>His Excellency as to where we had 
<lb/>been. The <placeName>Shire</placeName> being wholly unknown 
<lb/>to them except 3 miles at its mouth. 
<lb/>All is English discovery exactly as in 
<lb/>the <placeName>Niger</placeName> and all the right or Southern 
<lb/>bank which at <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> they farm 
<lb/>is paid tribute for by the Portuguese 
<lb/>to the Natives. From <placeName>Kongone</placeName> up to 
<lb/>this is all English discovery &amp; ought to 
<lb/>be free for the Portuguese line of 
<lb/>discovery ran from <placeName>Sofala</placeName> to <placeName>Senna</placeName>
<lb/>and then across the country to <placeName>Quilimane</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Candido</persName> denied to <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> that

<lb/>he had been there &amp; pointed to it, N. N. W. 
<lb/>of <placeName>Tette</placeName>. That he punted 36 hours under 
<lb/>cabbage palms - quite soft. If he had seen 
<lb/>a Lake at all it was Not <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> for it 
<lb/>is deep &amp; has no cabbages &amp; it is N. E.

<lb/><p>We found the southern edge of <placeName>Zomba</placeName> 6600 - a peak 8 or 10 miles off must

<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> botanized up a <choice><sic>peach</sic><corr>beach</corr></choice> a mile from our camp 500 ft. more (or 7000 say)<reg>.</reg></p><anchor xml:id="p1r-01"/><addSpan spanTo="#p1v-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fol. 1v'--></addSpan>
