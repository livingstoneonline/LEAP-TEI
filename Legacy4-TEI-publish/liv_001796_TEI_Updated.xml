<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Waller</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Thanks for your
<lb/>very welcome letters &amp; 
<lb/>also for the silk <w>under 
<lb break="no"/>shirts</w> the most <w>com- 
<lb break="no"/>fortable</w> things I ever 
<lb/>wore.  We must go to 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Johanna</settlement></placeName> for various 
<lb/>reasons - and intend 
<lb/>to start in a day or two. 
<lb/>This is a grievous 
<lb/>delay as the water is 
<lb/>now very low.  Something 
<lb/>has occurred to prevent 
<lb/><persName>Captain Oldfield</persName> sending

<lb/>without giving us 
<lb/>any provisions.  I must 
<lb/>go &amp; get them.  This is 
<lb/>a grievous loss of 
<lb/>time but it will all 
<lb/>turn out for the best

<lb/>We shall not meet old 
<lb/><persName>Seedy</persName> as he died of <term type="ailment">cholera</term>
<lb/>about the beginning of
<lb/>this year - &amp; will have 
<lb/>some work beating

<lb/>he was the active agent 
<lb/>in passing the <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>slavehunters up and 
<lb/>across <placeName><geogName type="lake">Shire</geogName></placeName> to hunt 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> and 
<lb/>I am not quite sure 
<lb/>but he may have a

<lb/>you can trust none of 
<lb/>them - they are degraded 
<lb/>to the lowest point the 
<lb/>devil can effect moral 
<lb/>and we can scarcely enter 
<lb/>into their feelings in the 
<lb/>unprotected state in which 
<lb/>they spend their lives -
<lb/>I have told <persName>Chibisa</persName>'s 
<lb/>people what I think of 
<lb/>his conduct in aiding 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Azungo</term> to do to the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Manganja</term> what they 
<lb/>now do to him and  
<lb/>will write immediately 
<lb/>to the <persName>Governor</persName> against 
<lb/><persName>Belshore</persName>.</p>
<lb/><p>The conduct of the 
<lb/>black English will not

       

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001796_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/>hurt you much. The 
<lb/>people soon learn the 
<lb/>difference and will 
<lb/>value you the more. 
<lb/>I am sorry for it 
<lb/>however.  I told <persName>Chibisa</persName>'s
<lb/>people that though I had 
<lb/>brought them they were  
<lb/>not slaves and were 
<lb/>accountable for their 
<lb/>actions as much as he 
<lb/>is himself.  I hope they 
<lb/>have not gone up 
<lb/>by the cataracts as that 
<lb/>would place difficulties 
<lb/>in our way in the 
<lb/>transport.</p>
<lb/><p>I bespoke 2 bales of 
<lb/>calico from <persName>Vianna</persName>

<lb/>and intend to ship them 
<lb/>in a day or two but 
<lb/><persName>Scudmore</persName> says that 
<lb/>you <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> need any 
<lb/>for six months at least 
<lb/>I shall bring them at 
<lb/>any rate.  I bought a 
<lb/>small cask of wine 
<lb/>such as we spoke of 
<lb/>2 for ourselves &amp; 
<lb/>1 for you.  It costs 
<lb/>£5 and <persName>Vianna</persName> says
<lb/>will be between 50 &amp; 60 
<lb/>bottles.  That too we 
<lb/>shall bring - when we 
<lb/>come say 2 months 
<lb/>hence.</p>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001796_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>I have suggested to <persName>Procter</persName>
<lb/>to begin translation as 
<lb/>a means of reducing 
<lb/>the language.  If you all 
<lb/>spent several hours 
<lb/>a day at it you would 
<lb/>soon discover the 
<lb/>advantage. The product 
<lb/>need not be thought of 
<lb/>as fit for the press 
<lb/>but to fit you for 
<lb/>more important works  
<lb/>I told <persName>Scudamore</persName> this 
<lb/>but he forgets &amp; I repeat 
<lb/>it to <persName>Procter</persName> &amp; you.</p>
<lb/><p>Thanks for your 
<lb/>kind sympathies 
<lb/>In return I say

<lb/>cherish exalted thought  
<lb/>of the great work you 
<lb/>have undertaken.  It is 
<lb/>a work which if faithful 
<lb/>you will look back 
<lb/>to with satisfaction 
<lb/>while the eternal ages 
<lb/>roll on their everlasting 
<lb/>course.  The Devil will 
<lb/>do all he can to hinder 
<lb/>you - by efforts from 
<lb/>without &amp; from within 
<lb/>but remember Him who

<lb/><p>The <persName>Governor</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>has got the sanction 

       

	<pb n="0009" facs="liv_001796_0009"><!--pb/@n='5r'--></pb>
<lb/>of his big brother 
<lb/>The <persName>Governor General</persName>
<lb/>of <placeName><country><choice><orig>Mosambique</orig><reg>Mozambique</reg></choice></country></placeName> to
<lb/>prosecute slave trade 
<lb/>on land.  I have written 
<lb/>a despatch which 
<lb/>will place the conduct 
<lb/>of the brothers in its 
<lb/>true light - probably 
<lb/>it will only take 
<lb/>effect when the 
<lb/>big brother is gone 
<lb/>but his successor 
<lb/>will be the better of
<lb/>the information now 
<lb/>given.  I have proved 
<lb/>that what the <persName>Governor

<lb/>General</persName> says about 
<lb/>slave trade being still 
<lb/>the law of the land 
<lb/>cannot be true except 
<lb/>by an oversight 
<lb/>which the statesmen 
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement></placeName> will be 
<lb/>sure to remedy.</p>
<lb/><p>The packet of letters 
<lb/>that came last by

<lb/>was at once delivered

<lb/><persName>Miss Mac</persName>. may have

<lb/>quietly take them across

<lb/>land as soon as 
<lb/>possible.  I hope they 
<lb/>have not disturbed 
<lb/>the people adjacent

<lb/>that they must not 
<lb/>allow you to be 
<lb/>disturbed.  If you had
