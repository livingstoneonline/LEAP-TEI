<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>Many thanks for your 
<lb/>two notes which gave me 
<lb/>much pleasure and some 
<lb/>pain. I tried to keep up 
<lb/>the good name we had 
<lb/>when we left but had 
<lb/>I not at last exerted my 
<lb/>authority the complete 
<w>dis-<lb break="no"/>organization</w> of the Expedition 
<lb/>would have been the 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001369_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>result. This all declared when 
<lb/>I told them I had accepted <persName>C<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><w>Bed-<lb break="no"/>ingfeld</w></persName> resignation. There has 
<lb/>not been a single jar with any 
<lb/>one and me or with each other 
<lb/>but there were several with him<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Fancy him talking of <persName>Skead's</persName>
<lb/>wonderful perseverance in 
<lb/>surveying as "that old fool 
<lb/>shewing off". It was sorely 
<lb/>against the grain for me to 
<lb/>take the step which caused the 
<lb/>resignation as he let it become 
<lb/>known that he would attack 
<lb/>me on the Sunday work - 
<lb/>I took warning by the experience 
<lb/>of the Grt Niger Expedition which 
<lb/>I have been informed had 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001369_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>prayers three times a day &amp; 
<lb/>stopped all Sunday - I would 
<lb/>not remain an hour in the 
<lb/>mangrove swamps and 
<lb/>have been attacked in the 
<lb/>Cape papers by an officer of 
<lb/>the Expedition in consequence 
<lb/>people may call out against 
<lb/>it but they would call out 
<lb/>more if I lost my men.</p>
<lb/><p>I ordered some things to 
<lb/>be sent up <choice><sic>a</sic><corr>at</corr></choice> Christmas 
<lb/>and the Admiral kindly 
<lb/>sent them up at once - this 
<lb/>makes me draw Â£105 
<lb/>sooner than I intended - the

<lb/>Portuguese war is ended and 
<lb/>we now hire canoes to carry 
<lb/>up all our things - so I keep 
<lb/>the money we have on 
<lb/>hand for that. I believe 
<lb/>we shall require no more 
<lb/>for a twelve month. We have 
<lb/>had no fever properly so 
<lb/>called but colds modified 
<lb/>by malaria - no one has been 
<lb/>ailing more than a week. 
<lb/>We have been taking quinine 
<lb/>in water of late and as I 
<lb/>considered that when we get 
<lb/>over the first unhealthy 
<lb/>season in January <choice><reg>M</reg><orig>m</orig></choice>arch

<lb/>needing something bracing I 
<lb/>ordered some ale porter &amp; 
<lb/>sherry for them. I consider 
<lb/>our Expedition as conducting 
<lb/>a health experiment as well 
<lb/>as other matters. I take all up 
<lb/>to <placeName>Tete</placeName> where <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Livingstone</persName>
<lb/>is now making magnetic 
<w>obser-<lb break="no"/>vations</w> and <persName>Major Secard</persName>
<lb/>gives us a house and plot 
<lb/>of land a mile or two above 
<lb/><placeName>Tete</placeName> to conduct experiments 
<lb/>in cotton and sugar cane<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>No sooner did the war 
<lb/>end than he took up the 
<lb/>little engine and sugar mill 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001369_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'--> 
<lb/>and a lot of luggage. At his 
<lb/>suggestion the gentlemen of 
<lb/><placeName>Tete</placeName> at once got me a ton 
<lb/>and a half of coal the first 
<lb/>ever digged in this country 
<lb/>and very feasible stuff it is 
<lb/>too though exposed in the 
<lb/>bank of the <placeName><unclear cert="low">Unatize</unclear></placeName> to the 
<lb/>action of floods &amp; sun for 
<lb/>ages. It will be better farther 
<lb/>in so all say. I send a report 
<lb/>on it by <persName>Thornton</persName> - also a 
<lb/>chart made by him. He being 
<lb/>unable to geologize in the 
<lb/>delta. <persName>Kirk</persName> has been working 
<lb/>hard at Economic botany<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He has made indigo - We have

<lb/>Lignum vitae -Ebony &amp; teak 
<lb/>or African oak &amp; some fine 
<lb/>fibres. I intend to take care 
<lb/>of the young men at the 
<lb/>house above <placeName>Tete</placeName> making 
<lb/>experiments in agriculture 
<lb/>till the healthier period comes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>If it is only a few rocks 
<lb/>that render the passage 
<lb/>tortuous and these of small 
<lb/>dimensions I may try 
<lb/>to blast them but I do not 
<lb/>promise it. I would not 
<lb/>grudge half a year's daily 
<lb/>toil as a quarry man if 
<lb/>I could open this pathway 
<lb/>to the Interior<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>The Portuguese wish to purchase 
<lb/>our cotton gins, and I mean 
<lb/>to sell two. The press will be 
<lb/>used for Buaze if it is in 
<lb/>abundance. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he war has 
<lb/>been very much against us 
<lb/>as it has caused immense 
<lb/>destruction of property and 
<w>depopu-<lb break="no"/>lation.</w> Portuguese are as friendly 
<lb/>as usual - all of them.</p>
<lb/><p>My companions have 
<lb/>had no serious illness - but 
<lb/>all have had ailments chiefly 
<lb/>colds except myself - we feel 
<lb/>the necessity of care - but this 
<lb/>river has the great peculiarity 
<lb/>of being a <hi rend="underline">sandy</hi> in contrast
