<lb/>a copy of which you enclosed I have 
<lb/>to remark that the statements of that 
<lb/>gentleman disagree in the most marked 
<lb/>manner with the promises <add place="above">he</add> held forth 
<lb/>respecting the Steam Launch, and 
<lb/>which I possess in his own 
<lb/>hand writing, dated as follows,</p>

<lb/><p>"Dear Sir, </p>
<lb/><p>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Livingstone's Launch 
<lb/>will more probably exceed Ten knots 
<lb/>than fall below it - when kept in 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">proper trim</hi> - she appears admirably

<lb/>for, the upper <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> above "<placeName>Tete</placeName>"

<lb/>if she is heavily laden with stores 
<lb/>her speed will of course be diminished 
<lb/>as her draught of water is increased. 
<lb/>As they are putting the engine togther 
<lb/>it is impossible to alter the power 
<lb/>"even if desirable - which it is not." </p>
<lb/><p>(Here follows an irrelevant sentence

<lb/><p>"D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Livingstone may calculate upon

<lb/><p>"On the Indian Rivers where light draught 
<lb/>is so essential - all the River steamers 
<lb/>are used as Tugs which is the best

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001508_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>in answer to my protest against an engine 
<lb/>of Ten horse power only.</p>
<lb/><p>The note which <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird</persName> has been good 
<lb/>enough to print shews indisputably a 
<lb/>disposition on my part to be satisfied. It 
<lb/>was written while the Launch was still supplied 
<lb/>with coal by the <term type="boat">Pearl</term>, and it was only 
<lb/>when the coal was expended that I discovered 
<lb/>the imposition that had been practised 
<lb/>on the Expedition. It was somewhat 
<lb/>mortifying, now that we were away from 
<lb/>all the means of remedying the evil, to 
<lb/>hear the statement made publicly. "Well 
<lb/>these Liverpool people must have imposed 
<lb/>on me", and to find that at the "<hi rend="underline">trial by 
<lb/>wood alone</hi>" "coal has seen to be 
<lb/>thrown in once and again" and other 
<lb/>things which though they can be proved 
<lb/>I forbear mentioning<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>At the trial trip in the <placeName>Mersey</placeName>
<lb/>she drew 19 inches without anything 
<lb/>in her <add place="above">but the weight equal to the house drew 25 inches</add> and since she came out here 
<lb/>and <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> her gear, she has never 
<lb/>drawn less than <hi rend="underline">Two Feet One Inch</hi><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Her crew of twelve kroomen - no 
<lb/>provisions - no fuel brought her 
<lb/>down to two feet two inches<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001508_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>While one day<reg>'</reg>s fuel (about a ton) and 
<lb/>as near as we could ascertain nearly 
<lb/>Four Tons brought her down to 
<lb/>Two feet six inches. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird</persName>
<lb/>"<hi rend="underline">designed</hi> her to carry when loaded" 
<lb/>to <hi rend="double-underline">2 feet</hi> Ten or Twelve Tons!"</p>
<lb/><p>I beg leave to submit the 
<lb/>particulars of our last trip in <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Laird<reg>'</reg>s</persName> "Dispatch boat" up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>. 
<lb/>We had four barrels of salt meat 
<lb/>and two bags of coffee, a medicine 
<lb/>chest, boxes of instruments of no 
<lb/>great weight &amp; half a bale of calico 
<lb/>the whole would not be a Ton in 
<lb/>weight. <add place="above">Fuel say another Ton<reg>.</reg></add> We had forty four <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>
<lb/>all men of light weight and six 
<lb/>Englishmen. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird</persName> "<hi rend="underline">intended</hi>" her 
<lb/>to draw 13 inches we found ourselves 
<lb/>drawing about 30 - and with the 
<lb/>steam between 50 &amp; 60 lbs could not 
<lb/>make three and a half knots. 
<addSpan spanTo="#p2v-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fol. 2v'--></addSpan>
<lb/>We passed over ground therefore at the rate of less than one knot an hour &amp; took 
<lb/>nearly a month to go from <placeName>Kongone Harbour</placeName> to <placeName>Chibisa's</placeName> about 200 miles<reg>.</reg><anchor xml:id="p2v-01"/>
<choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>women carrying loads on their heads 
<lb/>walked on to the next bend of the river 
<lb/>then waited till we came up again; 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">(against the 2 1/2 knot current of the 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName>)</del> and to our disgust we saw a lame 
<lb/>man walk away ahead of us altogether. 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001508_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'--> 
<lb/>But it will be said "She was overloaded<reg>".</reg>
<lb/>Not at all we had taken the precaution 
<lb/>of towing all the <term type="tribe">Makalolo</term> except 
<lb/>about a dozen to work the vessel 
<lb/>in two whalers behind - and when 
<lb/>doing so at a sudden bend the current 
<lb/>rushing past caught her bow and 
<lb/>one of the whalers when drawn across 
<lb/>stream with her was swamped and 
<lb/>to our sorrow one poor fellow 
<lb/>was drowned.</p>
<lb/><p>Take another example of the 
<w>per-<lb break="no"/>formances</w> of the Launch - In going 
<lb/>down from <placeName>Shupanga</placeName> to the sea 
<lb/>We were a good deal lighter than 
<lb/>in the last trip having no cargo 
<lb/>&amp; not 1/2 a ton of <del type="strikethrough"><unclear cert="low">nails</unclear></del><add place="above">fuel</add> &amp; with 
<lb/>but 14 natives and four Englishmen. 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Medlycott</persName> of the <term type="boat">Lynx</term> took 
<lb/>charge, and was dumfoundered 
<lb/>to find that a stiff breeze held her 
<lb/>paddles to a dead lock <add place="above">with between 50 &amp; 60 lbs steam</add> and obliged 
<lb/>us to anchor. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat was nothing 
<lb/>wonderful to us, for wherever 
<lb/>we have a 3 1/2 knot current 
<lb/>we cannot stem it even with 60lbs of steam<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001508_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'--> 
<lb/>If <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird</persName> will explain why at the 
<lb/>trial trip she ran <hi rend="underline">with the tide</hi> only in 
<lb/>one direction then waited till the tide turned 
<lb/>and ran back <hi rend="underline">with it</hi> in the other, the 
<lb/>discrepancy of performances here and 
<lb/>there may be accounted for. Her top 
<lb/>speed in the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> against the current<note n="*" place="marginleft" anchored="true">measured by anchoring in a part which 
<lb/>we cannot stem while going at full speed</note>
<lb/>measured repeatedly by Patent and 
<lb/>common log - has been 3 1/2 knots 
<lb/>with between 50 &amp; 60 lbs of steam. 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird</persName> promised over "Ten knots"<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Funnel - Furnace - Deck - 
<lb/>and Bottom all become shaky 
<lb/>simultaneously, after only Twelve 
<lb/>months work - i.e £1200 for 
<lb/>12 months. Extras all paid for 
<lb/>besides. It ought to be known 
<lb/>to the Admiralty that do what we 
<lb/>would we never could keep our 
<lb/>cabin dry. We have had carpenters 
<lb/>from men of war attempting to remedy 
<lb/>this evil, but have been obliged 
<lb/>to sleep on damp rotten cushions 
<lb/>continuously notwithstanding all 
<lb/>our efforts. Our botanist cannot 
<lb/>take his collections to the sea without

<lb/>eminent risk of their suffering the same 
<lb/>fate as those of poor <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Vogel</persName>
<lb/>of the great Niger Expedition. He 
<lb/>mentions in his journal that his cabin 
<lb/>was always in the same state as ours, 
<lb/>and public blame was most injustly 
<lb/>attached to the Admiralty. I enclose a 
<lb/>report in view of the bottom of this 
<lb/>most unworkmanlike &amp; flimsy vessel.</p>
<lb/><p>Copy</p>
<lb/><p rend="center"><hi rend="double-underline">Report</hi></p>
<lb/><p>1<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> August 1859. At <placeName>Kongone harbour</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>Beached the vessel furnished by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Macgregor Laird</persName> to the Zambesi Expedition 
<lb/>on the right bank of <placeName>Kongone harbour</placeName>
<lb/>and dug out the sand from the middle 
<lb/>compartment in order to examine her 
<lb/>bottom. Found the plates which were 
<lb/>only one sixteenth of an inch at the 
<lb/>beginning to be fairly worn &amp; rusted 
<lb/>through in several places, and the 
<lb/>whole so very thin that it is quite impossible 
<lb/>to patch them - bolts would have nothing 
<lb/>to hold on by. The rent would be 
<lb/>made worse by any mending <unclear cert="low">welding</unclear>
<lb/>hammering - no other process such 
<lb/>as wedging or staying can be applied<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We are therefore obliged to puddle the 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001508_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>bottom with clay in canvas bags over the 
<lb/>holes (covered with India rubber) as the only 
<lb/>means in our power of keeping her 
<lb/>afloat to perform the service of taking us 
<lb/>out of the unhealthy Delta. The Funnel 
<lb/>is also full of holes<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>In conclusion as every point advanced 
<lb/>respecting the engine - boiler &amp; vessel for 
<lb/>the information of the Admiralty has been 
<lb/>the result of my own patient and minute 
<lb/>investigation, I am sorry to observe the 
<lb/>mean, ungenerous &amp; totally unfounded 
<lb/>insinuation against our "Clyde Engineer" 
<lb/>who was not only recommended by <persName>Tod</persName>
<lb/>&amp; <persName>Macgregor</persName> of Glasgow (a firm in 
<lb/>every way superior to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Laird's</persName>) <del type="strikethrough">but</del> as 
<lb/>the very best man in their employment, 
<lb/>and we have been thoroughly satisfied with 
<lb/>his skill, zeal, and trustworthyness, but 
<lb/>he has joined us at a considerable pecuniary 
<lb/>disadvantage to himself as he occupied a post 
<lb/>of chief engineer in the largest sea going 
<lb/>ships. We intend sending the engine &amp; 
<lb/>boiler to a  Museum in Glasgow.</p>
