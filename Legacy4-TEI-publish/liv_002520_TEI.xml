<lb/><p>My dear <persName>Kirk</persName>, </p>
<lb/><p>I write a mere note at present as I 
<lb/>expect to send letters from <placeName>Ujiji</placeName> in a month 
<lb/>or two and the party that takes this is still 
<lb/>going west. The Arabs are very much 
<lb/>more careful not to frighten the people 
<lb/>than we ever were, messages and 
<lb/>presents are sent on ahead and explanations 
<lb/>given till it is tiresome to listen to the 
<lb/>details. The bearer of this <unclear cert="low">Leyd hi Ali</unclear>
<lb/>is anxious to be introduced to you and as 
<lb/>he has been extremely kind to me I can 
<lb/>recommend him as a very different sort of 
<lb/>man from the cruel Kilwa traders who 
<lb/>have strewed the road to <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> with human 
<lb/>bones; I have been with this party upwards 
<lb/>of four months and whatever they may be 
<lb/>elsewhere their conduct has been good during 
<lb/>that period, this man has been kind 
<lb/>and very hospitable to me personally

<lb/>so you may look on him as one of my 
<lb/>friends. I hope you keep your health? 
<lb/>Having no medicine mine is poorly when 
<lb/>not travelling. You will see the worthy 
<lb/>who lost our medicine box, his head is of 
<lb/>the shape always figured by <persName>Grant</persName>, he 
<lb/>has run away twice, had no complaint 
<lb/>to make of me, but to his companions 
<lb/>said he did not like work, prefers begging 
<lb/>from the Arab slaves in exchange for bringing 
<lb/>fire wood and water. There was some 
<lb/>pleasure <choice><sic>to</sic><corr>too</corr></choice> in bringing me to a stand still 
<lb/>I was so short handed<reg>.</reg> Fancy him 
<lb/>lying down in the jungle and having us 
<lb/>shooting, firing for him while he rested. 
<lb/>I had a bad lot this time - they nearly 
<lb/>all took after the wretched sepoys. </p>
