<lb/><p rend="right">At Sea 1<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> June 1864</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Seward</persName></p>
<lb/><p>On leaving you 
<lb/>I felt a little ashamed 
<lb/>in sending three cloths which 
<lb/>had been on view at <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Wittes</persName> to Memsahib for 
<lb/>after getting aboard I saw 
<lb/>that I should appear 
<lb/>as if I had thrown them 
<lb/>at her. I trust however 
<lb/>that you made allowance 
<lb/>for my heathenism.</p>
<lb/><p>One of Bullhead's men 
<lb/>had what I consider to be 
<lb/><term type="ailment">leprosy</term> in an incipient 
<lb/>state, but we were bothered 
<lb/>by the engines having been 
<lb/>left in not a very 
<lb/>creditable state. I saw after

<lb/>leaving <placeName>Mosambique</placeName> that 
<lb/>all hands were required to 
<lb/>start them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he whites pulling 
<lb/>at the starting rod like mad 
<lb/>supplemented by the blacks 
<lb/>with a rope to the same as 
<lb/>if they had hold of an elephant 
<lb/>by the tail. We could not 
<lb/>go astern &amp; nearly ran into 
<lb/><persName>Captain Bishop<reg>'</reg>s</persName> ship in 
<lb/>consequence. Away however 
<lb/>we went with 100 mile 
<lb/>current and a fine breeze. 
<lb/>One man down with a 
<lb/>severe bilious attack gave 
<lb/>me a regular turn at the 
<lb/>wheel. <choice><reg>V</reg><orig>v</orig></choice>ery nice when 
<lb/>you have nothing to do. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut 
<lb/>one becomes desperately 
<lb/>sleepy when it comes 
<lb/>every other four hours. 
<lb/>When we crossed the line 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002019_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>we got into a calm which 
<lb/>lasted 21 days. We steamed 
<lb/>out from the land, then 
<lb/>our only stoker who 
<lb/>managed the engines fell 
<lb/>sick of a bilious attack. 
<lb/>I mention this because 
<lb/>I have always experienced 
<lb/>great difficulty in getting 
<lb/>rid of the bile. All three 
<lb/>men had it: shovelfuls 
<lb/>of purgatives do not 
<lb/>act or if they do the 
<lb/>bile remains, and is 
<lb/>only got rid off gradually. 
<lb/>They all complained of 
<lb/>great pain across the 
<lb/>region of the navel. 
<lb/><choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut there was no tenderness 
<lb/>on pressure. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>ongue with 
<lb/>a very dark fur on it 
<lb/>and the other symptoms 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002019_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>of biliousness but no 
<lb/>pain across the forehead. 
<lb/>When bile came away 
<lb/>either by vomiting or 
<lb/>otherwise, after a week's 
<lb/>physicing with little or 
<lb/>no effect, they recovered 
<lb/>with scarcely any loss of 
<lb/>strength. Have you found 
<lb/>any remedy effectual in 
<lb/>promoting a discharge of 
<lb/>bile. Asclepias gigantea 
<lb/><add place="above">or <unclear cert="low">gigantisa</unclear></add> is used in some parts 
<lb/>of India for this, but I 
<lb/>never tried it. A scruple of 
<lb/>calomel in one case had 
<lb/>no effect nor did it salivate</p>
<lb/><p>I have been looking up 
<lb/>for the Dadileira in 
<lb/>Lindley, and think from 
<lb/>its resemblance to the 
<lb/>Sesamum which you 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_002019_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'-->
<lb/>know at Zanzibar as 
<lb/>yielding oil that it must 
<lb/>be the <hi rend="underline">Pedalium Murex</hi>
<lb/>of which he says that the 
<lb/>fresh leaf when agitated 
<lb/>in water renders it 
<lb/>mucilaginous, and is 
<lb/>prescribed by the Indian 
<lb/>doctors in <term type="ailment">dysuria</term> &amp; 
<lb/><term type="ailment">gonorrhoea</term> - the Dadileira 
<lb/>was shown to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Soares</persName>
<lb/>by an old native woman 
<lb/>&amp; must have more 
<lb/>than mucilage to produce purging so quickly in children.</p>
<lb/><p>I wish you would 
<lb/>try a wash of <term type="remedy">corrosive 
<lb/>sublimate</term> in <term type="ailment">the itch</term>
<lb/>often seen in Africans,

<lb/>"fiddle" is cured by one 
<lb/>application in London 
<lb/>when the Physician 
<lb/>gets it himself in 
<lb/>Dispensary practice - 
<lb/>it is made pretty strong 
<lb/>say 10 grams to the 
<lb/>ounce of water - or spirit. 
<lb/>I have found it very 
<lb/>efficaceous. now 
<lb/>for this tell me 
<lb/>your application to 
<lb/>those shocking indolent

<lb/>for the deception

<lb/>she burned a ton in
