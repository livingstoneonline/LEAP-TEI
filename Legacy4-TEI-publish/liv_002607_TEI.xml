<lb/><p rend="right">13 March 1872 </p>
<lb/><p rend="left"><persName>The Right Hon'ble 
<lb/>Sir W. R. S. V. Fitzgerald</persName>,</p>
<lb/><p>May it please your excellency 
<lb/>Before starting on the 
<lb/>Expedition into <placeName>Central Africa</placeName> in 
<lb/>which I am now engaged I received 
<lb/>very great kindness and important 
<lb/>service from the <placeName>Bombay</placeName> Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi> then 
<lb/>under <persName>Sir Bartle Frere</persName>. I have 
<w>writ-<lb break="no"/>ten</w> to express my thankfulness but 
<lb/>my letters to and from the coast 
<lb/>have all been destroyed, apparently 
<lb/>because I was considered a spy 
<lb/>on the slave trade whose 
<w>correspond-<lb break="no"/>ence</w> would do no good to the traffic. 
<lb/>The search for the sources of the 
<lb/><placeName>Nile</placeName> they knew to be sham &amp; I was 
<lb/>prevented from either getting supplies 
<lb/>of goods or sending information 
<w>coast-<lb break="no"/>wards.</w> This letter however goes by 
<lb/><persName>Henry M. Stanley</persName>, the travelling 
<lb/>correspondent of the <placeName>New York</placeName>
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">Herald</fw>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002607_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>Herald sent at an expense of over 
<lb/>ยฃ4,000 to obtain accurate 
<w>informa-<lb break="no"/>tion</w> &amp; afford assistance in my 
<lb/>isolation. If I give a short sketch 
<lb/>of my progress thus far it may 
<lb/>gratify the members of your Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi>. 
<lb/>who cheerfully and cordially lent 
<lb/>me their aid. </p>
<lb/><p>The first point of 
<w>import-<lb break="no"/>ance</w> I ascertained was the 
<lb/>watershed of <placeName>South Central Africa</placeName>
<lb/>was a broad tree-covered upland, 
<lb/>between 10ยบ - 12ยบ South Latitude. It 
<lb/>is generally between 4000 &amp; 5000 feet 
<lb/>above the level of the sea, but 
<w>moun-<lb break="no"/>tains</w> stand on it at various points 
<lb/>which are between 6000 &amp; 7000 feet 
<lb/>above the ocean level - These 
<w>moun-<lb break="no"/>tains</w> are possibly what the Geographer 
<lb/><persName>Ptolemy</persName>, for reasons now unknown, 
<lb/>called the "mountains of the moon" 
<lb/>because from the watershed on which 
<lb/>they stand springs almost innumerable arise and unite into burns or brooks 
<lb/>that never dry, and these converge 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">into</fw>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002607_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>into streams of 20-40-60 or even 80 
<lb/>yards - and all running together form 
<lb/>three great mains of drainage in a large 
<lb/>gradually sloping upland valley which, 
<lb/>beginning at the watershed, bends 
<lb/>Northward and is probably the great 
<lb/>valley of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>. The three <add place="above">great</add> mains of 
<lb/>drainage are large laucustine rivers = 
<lb/>extant specimens of what in 
<w>prehis-<lb break="no"/>toric</w> times abounded in Africa - and 
<lb/>which in the <placeName>Bechuana Country</placeName> in 
<lb/>the South still retain the name - 
<lb/>"Melapo" and in the North are 
<lb/>called "Wadys" both words meaning 
<lb/>the same thing - River beds in which 
<lb/>no water over now flows - these great 
<lb/>Lacustrine rivers often take the 
<lb/>name Lualaba &amp; require 
<w>dis-<lb break="no"/>tinctive</w> epithets which I have 
<lb/>ventured to supply. In the part 
<lb/>of the great valley now explored 
<lb/>there are, besides the great 
<w>lacus-<lb break="no"/>trine</w> rivers, fine lakes of great 
<lb/>extent - connected by the rivers 
<lb/>into one system - the furthest south

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002607_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>is called <placeName>Bangweolo</placeName>. It is between 
<lb/>140 &amp; 150 miles long &amp; 60 or 70 broad 
<lb/>and I tried to cross and measure 
<lb/>it accurately but on reaching an 
<lb/>island 24 miles off, found that 
<lb/>my mariners had stolen the canoe 
<lb/>and got into a flurry on learning 
<lb/>that the real owners was in pursuit. 
<lb/>They would come back for me - that 
<lb/>they would certainly, but I had 
<lb/>nothing left to hire another but my 
<lb/>coverlet &amp; it was very cold, being 
<lb/>4000 feet above the sea - so I did 
<lb/>not relish being a <persName>Robinson Crusoe</persName>
<lb/>on a small island, and an apparently 
<lb/>shoreless sea for 183ยบ degrees around, 
<lb/>&amp; came back. <placeName>Bangweolo</placeName> is not a 
<lb/>source of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, for no large 
<lb/>river begins in a Lake. It is fed 
<lb/>by the river <placeName>Chambeze</placeName> &amp; other streams 
<lb/>&amp; these may be considered sources 
<lb/>rising far South of anything that 
<lb/>geographers had dreamed. Emerging 
<lb/>from the Lake it takes the name 
<lb/><placeName>Luapula</placeName> and that flowing into Lake 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">Moero</fw>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_002607_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'-->
<lb/>Moero escapes thence by a huge rent 
<lb/>in the lofty mountains in the North - 
<lb/>East and in the country called <placeName>Rua</placeName>
<lb/>&amp; now assumes the name <placeName>Lualaba - 
<lb/>Webb's Lake</placeName>river. It next enters 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Kamolondo</placeName> and moves on 
<lb/>after that it has received in <placeName><w>Kamo-<lb break="no"/>londo</w></placeName> another large river - <placeName>Bartle 
<lb/>Frere's River</placeName> - which far South is called 
<lb/><placeName>Lufira</placeName> as the Webb's great <placeName>Lualaba</placeName>
<lb/>or Central Line of drainage - 
<w>Alto-<lb break="no"/>gether</w> west by <placeName>Kamolondo</placeName>, - <persName>Young's</persName>
<lb/><placeName>Lualaba</placeName> flows through <placeName>Lake Lincoln</placeName>
<lb/>&amp; then as to the great Lacustrine river 
<lb/><placeName>Lomame</placeName> it too falls into the Central 
<lb/>main &amp; four days beyond the 
<w>conflu-<lb break="no"/>ence</w> a fifth great lake is formed 
<lb/>the discovery of which I was forced 
<lb/>by <unclear cert="low">Bamain</unclear>
slaves sent to me instead 
<lb/>of men, to give up as the "unknown 
<lb/>Lake". Nothing is more surprising 
<lb/>in this Central region than the vast 
<lb/>amount of water in Lakes, - rivers - 
<lb/>and running rills - Webb's Lualaba, 
<lb/>North of <placeName>Kamolondo</placeName>, is from one to 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">three</fw>

<lb/>three miles broad and never can be 
<lb/>waded at any point or at any time 
<lb/>of the year. The <placeName>Manynema Country</placeName>
<lb/>through which it flows is inhabited 
<lb/>by cannibals &amp; no trader or traveller 
<lb/>ever ventured there till two years ago. 
<lb/>The elephants' tusks were left to 
<lb/>rot in the interminable forests where 
<lb/>the animals have been slain - the 
<lb/>first adventurers I met had 18,000 lbs 
<lb/>of ivory carried in two relays - and 
<lb/>I have seen others with 3000 lbs 
<lb/>weight bearing them in three relays 
<lb/>of men. <placeName>Bombay</placeName> merchants will 
<lb/>soon see these tusks in the market 
<lb/>some half rotten &amp; peeled to conceal 
<lb/>the effect of tooth of time - others 
<lb/>gnawed by a Rodent animal to 
<lb/>sharpen his teeth, as London rats do 
<lb/>on leaden pipes. In the forests one 
<lb/>sees the sun about midday by thin 
<lb/>pencils of rays sent down through 
<lb/>the gloom, &amp; at the clearances round 
<lb/>villages. The <term type="tribe">Manynema</term>, or as the 
<lb/>Arabs shorten it <!-- TODO SM: '=' --><term type="tribe">Manyema</term>, live

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_002607_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'-->
<lb/>in villages &amp; each headman is 
<w>inde-<lb break="no"/>pendent</w> of &amp; hates every other - there is 
<lb/>no political cohesion and no great 
<lb/>King in the whole country. They knew 
<lb/>as little about the country as would 
<lb/>be geographers who collected all 
<lb/>their knowledge from slaves. At 30 
<lb/>miles distance they often had never 
<lb/>heard of their own great river. It 
<lb/>was therefore very difficult to 
<w>ex-<lb break="no"/>plore</w> &amp; find out where the drainage 
<lb/>went. I made four attempts in 
<lb/>different directions but the vegetation 
<lb/>was so dense, no help could be obtained 
<lb/>by a glimpse of the river, - the mud 
<lb/>was simply awful - plunging and 
<lb/>plashing told severely on all. The 
<lb/>ivory traders in spite of their intense 
<lb/>eagerness to please the <unclear cert="low">Bancain</unclear>
<lb/>employers had often to give in by 
<lb/>irritable eating ulcers fastening on 
<lb/>the feet. I was laid up by them 
<lb/>for five months. It is impossible 
<lb/>to describe the toil of winding ones 
<lb/>way through forests so dense only 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">elephants</fw>

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_002607_0008"/><!--pb/@n='8'-->
<lb/>elephants &amp; buffaloes could penetrate 
<lb/>&amp; often in mud from calf to thigh 
<lb/>deep - these must be facsimiles of 
<lb/>the haunts frequented by the megatheria 
<lb/>&amp; the great old uncomfortable beasts 
<lb/>that geologists speak about - and 
<lb/>then after all the great river made 
<lb/>so much Westing - some <add place="above">five</add> degrees of 
<lb/>Long. - I could not for a long time 
<lb/>be sure that it was not the <placeName>Congo</placeName> - 
<lb/>&amp; who would run the risk of being 
<lb/>put into a cannibal <term type="tribe">Manyema</term>
<lb/>pot and be converted into black 
<lb/>man for anything less than the 
<lb/>grand old <placeName>Nile</placeName>. But at length 
<lb/><placeName>Bartle Frere's river</placeName> &amp; the <placeName>Lomane</placeName>
<lb/>river - the Western lines of drainage 
<lb/>flowed into the Central main &amp; 
<lb/>report said it ran beyond the 
<lb/>fifth or "unknown lake" into 
<lb/>large reedy marshes - possibly 
<lb/>Petherick<reg>'</reg>s - or the Western arm in 
<lb/>distinction from the Eastern which 
<lb/><persName>Speke</persName>, <persName>Grant</persName>, &amp; <persName>Baker</persName> believed 
<lb/>to be the <placeName>Nile</placeName>. - I do not speak 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right">positively</fw>

	<pb n="0009" facs="liv_002607_0009"/><!--pb/@n='9'-->
<lb/>positively yet too many clever men 
<lb/>have been mistaken for me to assume 
<lb/>the dogmatic tone. Before leaving 
<lb/>the watershed I may add that four 
<lb/>fountains are reported thereon &amp; 
<lb/>each at no great distance off becomes 
<lb/>a large river. Two are reported 
<lb/>to flow South &amp; two run North - 
<lb/>the <placeName>Liambai</placeName> or <placeName>Upper Zambesi</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>the Kapul flow South. <placeName>Bartle 
<lb/>Frere river</placeName> &amp; the Lomane flow 
<lb/>North to <placeName>Egypt</placeName>(?). I have 
<w>pre-<lb break="no"/>sumed</w> to give names to those 
<w>foun-<lb break="no"/>tains</w> whose rivers I know, &amp; my 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>cluding</w> trip is to rediscover these 
<lb/>fountains for I have the presumption 
<lb/>to start the hypothesis in <placeName>Central 
<lb/>Africa</placeName>, and without a single book 
<lb/>of reference, that these are the 
<w>foun-<lb break="no"/>tains</w> mentioned to <persName>Herodotus</persName> by 
<lb/><persName>The Secretary of Minerva</persName> in the city 
<lb/>of <placeName>Lais</placeName> in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> - if they exist 
<lb/>only in my imagination, from the dim 
<lb/>recollection of reading the ancient 
<lb/>historian in boyhood, then we shall see -

	<pb n="0010" facs="liv_002607_0010"/><!--pb/@n='10'-->
<lb/>and I shall tell you that I was 
<lb/>mistaken; another point to be examined 
<lb/>is the very extensive underground 
<lb/>excavations which seem to be ancient, 
<lb/>for the natives all ascribe their formation to the deity and all have 
<lb/>running streams of water laid on 
<lb/>&amp; are equal to the protection of the 
<lb/>people of large districts in cases 
<lb/>of invasion - also very ancient &amp; 
<lb/>inexhaustible Malachite copper 
<lb/>mines at <placeName>Katanga</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>I have been much longer 
<lb/>than I intended - 6 years instead of 
<lb/>2 - but I have lost two whole years 
<lb/>in time, been burdened by 1800 miles 
<lb/>of useless tramp, - &amp; how much waste 
<lb/>of money I cannot say, all through 
<lb/>the matter of supplies &amp; men being 
<lb/>entrusted to our Banian <del type="strikethrough">Bichan</del> <add place="above">Indian</add>
<lb/>fellow subjects &amp; they entrusted 
<lb/>the whole thing to slaves who lay and 
<lb/>feasted on my stores for sixteen 
<lb/>months &amp; then sold off all for slaves 
<lb/>and ivory - the slave trade in all

<lb/>this region, &amp; especially in <placeName>Manyema</placeName>, 
<lb/>is carried on almost exclusively 
<lb/>with arms, ammunition &amp; goods 
<lb/>advanced to Arab Agents by 
<lb/>Banians - their slaves needed no 
<lb/>more than a hint &amp; all came &amp; 
<lb/>solemnly swore that they were told 
<lb/>not to follow but force me back - they 
<lb/>forced me back 500 miles and again 
<lb/>I had to come 300 to seize goods here 
<lb/>sent by another lot of slaves - and my 
<lb/>Agent at <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> believes all they 
<lb/>tell him. - It was stated in the 
<lb/><placeName>House of Lords</placeName> on the authority he receives 
<lb/>that all my wants had been supplied 
<lb/>while I virtually got only what I
