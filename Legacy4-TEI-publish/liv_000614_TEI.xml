						<note type="rendNote">Kolobeng, now in Botswana, was Livingstone\'s third (and last) mission station and marital home. He built a house and lived there with his wife, Mary, 1847-1852. There was also a church and a school. His daughter Elizabeth, born in 1850 and died age a month or six weeks, is buried there. Livingstone used Kolobeng, which had a good water supply, to launch his exploration of South Central Africa. Kolobeng was sacked by the Boers in 1852 although the details of what occurred are not clear. There is a Livingstone Memorial near the ruins of the mission station which is in today\'s Botswana.

<lb/><p>My very Dear Friends</p>
<lb/><p>It is no task to write to you - I would write 
<lb/>frequently indeed if I took up my pen every time I think &amp; 
<lb/>talk about you But time is not allowed one for 
<lb/>all I wish to do so you must take my efforts as all 
<lb/>I can give to show that I am still the same as ever 
<lb/>I am at present out at our garden which by the way 
<lb/>is no nearer than forty miles from our residence 
<lb/>We have very little water at <placeName ref="#d1e80">Chonuane</placeName> &amp; cannot 
<lb/>irrigate this year. The past season has been one 
<lb/>of unwonted drought even in this thirsty land 
<lb/>many fountains are quite dried up and the corn 
<lb/>crop of the natives is nearly an entire failure 
<lb/>the scarcity of water compels us to look for corn 
<lb/>elsewhere so we sought for a fountain elsewhere 
<lb/>&amp; after some	toil have made a watercourse &amp; sowed 
<lb/>some English corn. Where we ploughed is all over 
<lb/>marked by footsteps of the Elephant Rhinocerous 
<lb/>&amp; buffalo. We have disturbed them in their pasture 
<lb/>and the lion too seems to think we have no right 
<lb/>here for they have growled enough at us lately both 
<lb/>by night &amp; day. - this absence from ho<del type="strikethrough" resp="#CO">pe</del>me prevents 
<lb/>my using the best paper I have for you. But 
<lb/>you will excuse me I know. I go over on 
<lb/>saturdays to see my <name type="person_ml">wife</name> &amp; <name type="person_rl">child</name> &amp; preach on 
<lb/>sunday We depart at daylight &amp; reach the house about 
<lb/>an hour after dark - this notwithstanding the 
<lb/>continual <unclear cert="medium">work</unclear> the whole day on oxback which 
<lb/>is not a great deal quicker than a native walks 
<lb/>Our child is growing - little <persName ref="#d1e141">Robert <surname>Moffat</surname></persName> if he lives 
<lb/>may see you yet. this I shall never while here 
<lb/>on earth. How pleasant it would be to have

<lb/>begun to write you several times but never 
<lb/>finished one good enough for <persName ref="#d1e172">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><surname>Pyne</surname></persName> I 
<lb/>do not wonder at this for she has very 
<lb/>little time. She must attend to everything almost 
<lb/>and everything has to be made from the raw 
<lb/>material. She dreams about you which shews 
<lb/>her thoughts are frequently turned "youwards"

<lb/>her husband Did I ever thank you for patchwork 
<lb/>shawls? If not I now do. I gave one lately to a 
<lb/>woman who assisted to a loaf of bread on 
<lb/>an occasion when I had tasted none for

<lb/>came to see us at <placeName ref="#d1e367">Mabotsa</placeName> and in returning homewards 
<lb/>the people lost some sleeping skins. Two of them 
<lb/>returned to seek them and took the only gun with 
<lb/>them. <persName ref="#d1e377">Ann</persName> was left thus with the waggon driver 
<lb/>&amp; only one servant - a female. A lion attacked the 
<lb/>oxen while still daylight. She saw him kill one - 
<lb/>He then cooly eat it and as the people did not return 
<lb/>with the gun she lay in the waggon listening to 
<lb/>the impudent brute coming every now &amp; then 
<lb/>to the waggon sides &amp; giving a roar as much as 
<lb/>to say "Disturb me if you dare." In the morning
