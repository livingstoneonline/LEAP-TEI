<lb/>28 October 1859 </p>
<lb/><p rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Milne</persName>
<lb/>As we have not yet 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> any letters from home since 
<lb/>our departure in 1858 I take advantage 
<lb/>of this and skip over apologies to those 
<lb/>of my friends whom I have neglected<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But I may say to you and <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> M.</persName> that 
<lb/>I have not been idle, nor have I felt 
<lb/>at ease when I remembered my duty to 
<lb/>you. I have been employed in 
<lb/>work which I did contemplate on 
<lb/>leaving you. The naval officer 
<lb/>with whom I was furnished was 
<lb/>possessed with the idea that instead 
<lb/>of coming to seek the elevation of the 
<lb/>African and <choice><sic>developement</sic><corr>development</corr></choice> of the 
<lb/>country. <choice><reg>H</reg><orig>h</orig></choice>e was about to discover 
<lb/>the ten lost tribes, as if of all things 
<lb/>in the world we had not plenty 
<lb/>of Jews already. I was soon forced 
<lb/>to send this visionary away and do 
<lb/>the work myself. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hough I assure you 
<lb/>I would as soon drive a cab as a 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001497_0002"/><!--pb/@n='39v'--> 
<lb/>steamer. We have but lately begun 
<lb/>our proper work. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd I am happy to 
<lb/>tell you that our prospects brighten 
<lb/>where I never contemplated exploring. 
<lb/>We <del type="strikethrough">went</del><add place="above">steamed</add> up this river over one hundred 
<lb/>miles though only three were previously 
<lb/>known to the Portuguese. We have 
<lb/>also traced it on foot another hundred 
<lb/>and found that it emerges from 
<lb/>the hitherto undiscovered <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName>
<lb/>or <placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName>. This lake must be 
<lb/>large for it gives off a large river 
<lb/>(Shire) without diminution of more 
<lb/>than two feet during the whole year. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here 
<lb/>are too only 33 miles of cataracts in 
<lb/>it and a common road could easily 
<lb/>be made past them. Here you find 
<lb/>the finest cotton field in the world 
<lb/>for it is of unknown extent watered 
<lb/>by the Lakes - <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Tamàndua</placeName>
<lb/>and there are no frosts to endanger 
<lb/>or cut off the crops as in <placeName>America</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Instead too of the unmerciful toil 
<lb/>required to raise the crops in that 
<lb/>country - one sowing of foreign 
<lb/>probably of American seed already 
<lb/>introduced by the natives themselves

<lb/>serves for crops for three years though 
<lb/>the plants be annually burned down. 
<lb/>We have besides changes of climate 
<lb/>produced by the land lying in terraces 
<lb/>of different heights. The third terrace 
<lb/>is 3000 feet high - and on it 
<lb/>rises the <placeName>Mount Zomba</placeName> between 
<lb/>7000 &amp; 8000 feet in altitude<reg>.</reg><choice><reg>O</reg><orig>o</orig></choice>ne 
<lb/>days march took us from the 
<lb/>hot sultry valley of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> into a 
<lb/>cool climate, and all the terraces 
<lb/>are abundantly supplied with 
<lb/>running rills of deliciously 
<lb/>cold water. Fancy our tramping 
<lb/>in the sun when the thermometer 
<lb/>on the ground reached 126° and 
<lb/>climbing up two thousand feet 
<lb/>into air delightfully refreshing. Then 
<lb/>on to <placeName>Zomba</placeName> into the cold. I am 
<lb/>hoping that the Church Missionary 
<lb/>Society long anxious to enter <placeName>Eastern 
<lb/>Africa</placeName> will take advantage of this 
<lb/>opening. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey can be away from 
<lb/>the unfriendly coast tribes at once - 
<lb/>and check the slave trade in the 
<lb/>middle of the slave market. We met 
<lb/>a large party of East coast slave 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001497_0004"/><!--pb/@n='40v'--> 
<lb/>traders with an immense number of 
<lb/>slaves and elephants tusks. A more black-
               <choice><sic>gaurd</sic><corr>guard</corr></choice> looking lot I never saw. When 
<lb/>they found out that we were English 
<lb/>they slipped off by night, probably thinking 
<lb/>the same of us as we did of them. 
<lb/>The policy of <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName> in 
<lb/>repressing the slave trade has given the 
<lb/>English a prestige of great value. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Tamàdua</placeName> is about ninety miles 
<lb/>long. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut no one could tell us how 
<lb/>long <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> was. We could not explore 
<lb/>it for we had left our sham vessel 
<lb/>called a steamer in a sinking state. 
<lb/>Funnel, Furnace, Deck &amp; Bottom 
<lb/>went down simulaneously after only 
<lb/>12 months wear. £1200 for 12 months 
<lb/>(extras all paid for besides), was pretty 
<lb/>fair without any whine from the 
<lb/>contractor of "doing it all for the good of 
<lb/>the cause." It has been a great hindrance 
<lb/>to us from first to last involving 
<lb/>enormous toil, and as in the Great 
<lb/><placeName>Niger</placeName> expedition, always wet. Indeed 
<lb/>we have lain for many months on 
<lb/>damp rotten cushions - but thanks to 
<lb/>God we have not lost a man yet. 
<lb/>We have had a first rate opportunity of 
<lb/>trying the remedies for fever I had opted when 
<lb/>alone &amp; have been sucessful<reg>.</reg><persName>David Livingstone</persName></p><addSpan spanTo="#p39r-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of fos. 39r, 40r'--></addSpan>
