<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain <surname>Drew</surname></persName></p>
<lb/><p>I beg leave to tender 
<lb/>you and <persName>Mrs <surname>Drew</surname></persName> my 
<lb/>hearty thanks for your 
<lb/>kindness to me while with 
<lb/>you and if possible 
<lb/>heartier ones for your 
<lb/>generous kindness to 
<lb/>my <persName>wife</persName> after my 
<lb/>departure, I shall ever 
<lb/>retain a grateful sense 
<lb/>of your sympathy &amp; 
<lb/>may the <persName>Almighty</persName> abundantly 
<lb/>reward you.</p>

<lb/><p>I had just been up at <placeName><settlement>Tete</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>with my first cargo for I 
<lb/>have been compelled to turn 
<lb/>skipper myself. There we were 
<lb/>the first steamer that ever 
<lb/>appeared among them and 
<lb/>were visited with as much 
<lb/>interest as you would do 
<lb/>the Leviathan. We got a 
<lb/>ton and a half of coals 
<lb/>the very first ever digged in 
<lb/>this region. they were from 
<lb/>the surface where they have 
<lb/>been washed by the floods 
<lb/>of the rivulet in which they 
<lb/>appear for ages and yet 
<lb/>they gave pretty good steam 
<lb/>better the engineer says than 
<lb/>the American which he used 
<lb/>to get at <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName>. We are 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001364_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>rather glad of this for we have 
<lb/>a great abundance of both coal 
<lb/>and iron and with these two 
<lb/>there is hope of civilization<supplied resp="#CO">.</supplied>
<lb/>We see the <placeName>river<!--geog note: river--></placeName> at its lowest 
<lb/>nearly and though it has 
<lb/>fallen many feet since 
<lb/><persName>Captains <surname>Bedingfeld</surname></persName> and 
<lb/><persName><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> thought so favourably 
<lb/>of it there is not much 
<lb/>difference in its general 
<lb/>appearance. I had a good 
<lb/>deal of difficulty at one 
<lb/>spot where it is about 
<lb/>four miles wide. Indeed 
<lb/>I spent five days seeking 
<lb/>a channel but having 
<lb/>found it we came down 
<lb/>from <placeName><settlement>Tete</settlement></placeName> to Senna in 
<lb/>four days. Above <unclear cert="high" reason="hand"><placeName>Supata</placeName></unclear>
<lb/>it was all easy as it runs 
<lb/>one or two channels only<supplied resp="#CO">.</supplied></p>

<lb/><p><term type="boat">This vessel</term> draws 2 ft 6. when loaded 
<lb/>and is very weak in her engine being 
<lb/>but ten horse power. The canoes take 
<lb/>the shine out of us except when we are 
<lb/>coming down stream. Going up, they 
<lb/>pass us and look back at the 
<lb/><term type="boat">"Asthmatic"</term> as she ought to be called 
<lb/>slowly panting along.</p>
<lb/><p>My men <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> me with

<lb/>fallen victims to <del type="strikethrough">fev</del> small pox 
<lb/>and six were murdered by a chief 
<lb/>in a drunken fit. for these our 
<lb/>hearts are very sore. By direction

<lb/>us any assistance in her power 
<lb/>and I have come down to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>what we need. <term type="boat">The Furnace</term> has 
<lb/>been of service but as she draws 
<lb/>when loaded more than <term type="boat">the Launch</term>
<lb/>and the latter is very slow, swinging 
<lb/>round if furnace touches the least 
<lb/>sand, she has not done all we 
<lb/>expected. She is up at <placeName><settlement>Tete</settlement></placeName> now<supplied resp="#CO">.</supplied>
<lb/><persName>The Admiral</persName> and indeed all the naval 
<lb/>authorities including of course yourself 
<lb/>have been remarkably kind &amp; obliging</p>
