<lb/><p><del type="strikethrough">The Editor of the Times</del></p>
<lb/><p><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Livingstone<reg>'</reg>s</persName> expedition arrived 
<lb/>in <placeName>Pomony Bay,</placeName> the residence of 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> consul Sunley</persName> on the island of 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna,</placeName> on the 9<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> of April last 
<lb/>from the river <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> on the 
<lb/>coast of <placeName>Africa,</placeName> and came 
<lb/>round to the chief town to coal 
<lb/>the <term type="boat">"Pioneer"</term> from H.M.S.Wasp 
<lb/>on the 11<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> They had ascended 
<lb/>the river only thirty miles, when 
<lb/>halting to wood their ship, a 
<lb/>mark was made on a tree shewed that 
<lb/>the water was falling at the rate of 
<lb/>six or seven inches a day. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>had found some parts carrying 
<lb/>no more than five or six feet 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001650_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>of water, and as they drew nearly 
<lb/>five feet, they had to look out and 
<lb/>not be left, by spending more 
<lb/>time in going up, fixtures till the 
<lb/>flood of next year. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he cause of 
<lb/>this unsuccessful termination 
<lb/>is attributed to various delays 
<lb/>suffered by the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> <add place="above">in the voyage out</add> making 
<lb/>her at least quite two months 
<lb/>behind the time for a successful 
<lb/>trip up the river. After coaling 
<lb/>they left for the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> intending 
<lb/>to go up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>, and then 
<lb/>make a road past <placeName>Murchison's 
<lb/>cataracts</placeName> on that river to <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Nyassa.</placeName> The distance is only 
<lb/>thirty five miles, and it is hoped 
<lb/>that they will carry a boat 
<lb/>up above the cataracts and 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001650_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>by that means explore the <placeName>Lake</placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>It is also in contemplation 
<lb/>to settle the point whether <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>comes out of Nyassa as asserted 
<lb/>by all the people they met before 
<lb/>going in the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> again to 
<lb/>that river. The Oxford and 
<lb/>Cambridge mission accompany 
<lb/>the expedition up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>, and 
<lb/>it is proposed to place these 
<lb/>gentlemen on the plateau of 
<lb/>2000 feet <add place="above">above the sea</add> on which stands 
<lb/><placeName>Mount Zomba</placeName> - there they are 
<lb/>likely to enjoy good health, 
<lb/>while pursuing their enterprise 
<lb/><addSpan spanTo="#p3-01" place="marginleft"><!--addSpan/@place='left margin of p3'--></addSpan>they have had a good deal of <term type="ailment">fever,</term> but no 
<lb/>mortality. The healthy season begins in May.<anchor xml:id="p3-01"/></p>
<lb/><p>The <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> will probably 
<lb/>turn out to be the entrance into 
<lb/><placeName>Eastern Africa</placeName> - it must 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001650_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>however be navigated with a 
<lb/>vessel of light draught, and with 
<lb/>the same skill as is required 
<lb/>in the above bridge London 
<lb/>passenger boats. On the question 
<lb/>whether it actually derives its 
<lb/>waters from <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> the D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> thinks 
<lb/>that it cannot come out of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> he discovered - but 
<lb/><add place="above">from</add> some other lake. The reasons 
<lb/>he adduces are - <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> is already 
<lb/>known to give off one large 
<lb/>river, the <placeName>Shire</placeName> - this river 
<lb/>never rises nor falls more 
<lb/>than three feet nor is its water 
<lb/>ever discoloured. The <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>rises and falls six or more 
<lb/>feet, becomes very muddy and 
<lb/>no instance is known of one 
<lb/>Lake giving off two large rivers 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001650_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'--> 
<lb/>the probability is therefore that if 
<lb/>the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> does not come out of 
<lb/>a <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> or <placeName>Nyanza</placeName> (lake 
<lb/>or piece of water) 
<lb/>it is some 
<lb/>other than that discovered by 
<lb/>the Expedition. It is well known 
<lb/>that lakes having no outlets 
<lb/>become brackish in the course 
<lb/>of ages. This is the case with 
<lb/><placeName>Shirwa</placeName> - but <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> and 
<lb/><placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> are sweet. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>former owes its sweetness 
<lb/>to the <placeName>Shire</placeName> flowing out of it. 
<lb/>Does <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> owe its 
<lb/>sweetness to the <placeName>Rovuma?</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>While the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term> was at 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna</placeName> a French vessel having 
<lb/>sixty slaves on board lay anchored 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001650_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'--> 
<lb/>close to <term type="boat">H.M.S. Wasp</term>. She came 
<lb/>from <placeName>Quiloa</placeName> on the <placeName>coast of 
<lb/>Africa</placeName> where the cost of the 
<lb/>slaves was twenty two dollars. 
<lb/>The slave trader then went 
<lb/>to <placeName>Comoro Island</placeName>, and paid 
<lb/>250 dollars to one of the chiefs 
<lb/>there for a certificate that 
<lb/>the slaves had been <hi rend="underline">engaged</hi>
<lb/>there. This last transaction 
<lb/>could not be hid from 
<lb/>all the other chiefs, but the 
<lb/>slaver cannot be captured. 
<lb/>He had even the assurance 
<lb/>to ask a supply of provisions 
<lb/>and rum from the Man- 
<lb/>of War. The <persName>Emperor of France</persName>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001650_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'--> 
<lb/>is said to have declared that 
<lb/>if the so called "free emigration" 
<lb/>were the slave trade he would 
<lb/>not have it at any price - 
<lb/>here unfortunately his people 
<lb/>have it at the prices above 
<lb/>stated.</p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi> the object of attempting 
<lb/>the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> is to get an 
<lb/>entrance into <placeName>Eastern Africa</placeName>
<lb/>exterior to the Portuguese claims<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We hope to carry a boat up 
<lb/>to <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> and ascertain the 
<lb/>nature of the connection 
<lb/>if any exists, between the 
<lb/>Lake and the River.</p>
