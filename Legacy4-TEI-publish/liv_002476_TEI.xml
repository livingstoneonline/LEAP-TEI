<lb/><p>It is not a good climate by 
<lb/>any means. <persName>Rae's</persName> brother 
<lb/>came out here to supply <persName>George's</persName>
<lb/>place. He has been ill ten days 
<lb/>and died last night. <persName>Miss 
<lb/>Tozer</persName> had to go off to the <placeName>Seychelles</placeName>
<lb/>yesterday in ill health and 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Seward</persName> have just 
<lb/>come back from those islands 
<lb/>whither he went nearly dead 
<lb/>four months ago. The town 
<lb/>is by the shore on a tongue of 
<lb/>land behind which the sea 
<lb/>comes. The shore is indescribably 
<lb/>filthy &amp; provocative of holding 
<lb/>the nose. The island to look 
<lb/>at is extremely beautiful. 
<lb/>Groves of coconut palms, 
<lb/>mangrove <unclear cert="low">topes</unclear> &amp; groves 
<lb/>of <unclear cert="low">clove</unclear> trees flourish 
<lb/>in perpetual greeness, but it is 
<lb/>a sickly place. Slaves swarm 
<lb/>and they seem to have collected 
<lb/>all the ugliest of their race 
<lb/>from <placeName>Africa.</placeName> One never 
<lb/>sees a face on which the eye

<lb/>is the "fair sex"! I know their 
<lb/>tribal marks. Nearly all 
<lb/>come from Lake Nyassa 
<lb/>and beyond it. One woman 
<lb/>said to me that she had 
<lb/>heard of my passing in a 
<lb/>boat but she did not see 
<lb/>me. Another came from 
<lb/>hundreds of miles beyond 
<lb/>the Lake. The slave owners 
<lb/>go about in the slave mar
<lb/>ket here with a woman or 
<lb/>a child held by the hand 
<lb/>calling out "seven dollars" 
<lb/>"seven dollars." The highest 
<lb/>was 20 dollars. They sit in 
<lb/>rows looking dejected &amp; 
<lb/>ashamed. An Arab or a 
<lb/>Persian comes forward &amp; 
<lb/>raises up a girl - opens her 
<lb/>mouth &amp; examines her 
<lb/>teeth - then her limbs &amp;

<lb/>enquires how any scar was 
<lb/>got. A wound from the lash 
<lb/>decreases the value because 
<lb/>it shews that she has been 
<lb/>obstinate or disobedient - He 
<lb/>usually ends by throwing 
<lb/>his stick 20 yards or so &amp; 
<lb/>makes her walk for it to 
<lb/>see as a horse dealer would 
<lb/>say "her paces." One of my 
<lb/>men was with me &amp; he 
<lb/>became very much excited 
<lb/>on seeing "wives for sale." 
<lb/>all dressed up with flowers, 
<lb/>and eyebrows painted. He 
<lb/>said in English "<unclear cert="low">Wife</unclear> all 
<lb/>same sister. All same as 
<lb/>mother. Arab man sell wife 
<lb/>very bad oh very bad. &amp; 
<lb/>he began to protest to them 
<lb/>so energetically I had to take 
<lb/>him away. One said to him

<lb/><p>The Sultan gave me 
<lb/>a house and he furnishes

<lb/>the crew of the <unclear cert="low">Thule</unclear> back

<lb/>while it is getting ready all 
<lb/>our men are entertained 
<lb/>at the Sultan's expense. 
<lb/>This is rather handsome 
<lb/>and if he would only 
<lb/>give up slaving he 
<lb/>would be a "brick" of a 
<lb/>Sultan. but his chief 
<lb/>income is derived from

<lb/>this source. We had our 
<lb/>formal presentation 
<lb/>after D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Seward came - 
<lb/>the toothache was nearly 
<lb/>gone and he insisted 
<lb/>on meeting us &amp; again 
<lb/>coming down to shake 
<lb/>hands in the street. I 
<lb/>told him what <persName>Sir Bartle 
<lb/>Frere</persName> said to the South 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">Mahratta</unclear> princes on the 
<lb/>necessity of education 
<lb/>and if they did not 
<lb/>make some exertion 
<lb/>to get knowledge power 
<lb/>would slip through their

<lb/>left behind in the race 
<lb/>I meant him of course

<lb/>wished him to be a

<lb/>We did not wish to 
<w>mo-<lb break="no"/>nopolize</w> it. Everything 
<lb/>he could send to <placeName>Bombay</placeName>
<lb/>for sale would find a 
<lb/>ready market there. We 
<lb/>needed grain of all sorts 
<lb/>as rice - dura - in fact 
<lb/>everything but slaves" 
<lb/>he laughed at my last 
<lb/>remark. Told me he would 
<lb/>help me as much as he 
<lb/>could now &amp; at all future 
<lb/>times - and I was never to 
<lb/>have any shame in telling 
<lb/>him what to do for me. </p>
