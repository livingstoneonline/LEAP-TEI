<lb/><p rend="left"><persName>The Reverend Doctor Tidman</persName></p>
<lb/><p rend="center">My Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">When the obstacles which caused our <!-- Question again about how to code first line- right-margin coding, or spacing coding? (lett76 ref) HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>detention at <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> were removed we passed quickly towards the country
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="village">Sebituane</settlement></placeName><choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> within one degree of Latitude from this town. All the people
<lb/>were then suddenly laid prostrate by <term type="ailment">fever</term>, except one lad and myself. This
<lb/>caused a further loss of time but through the goodness of God, all recovered.
<lb/>On reaching this, the Southern capital of the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> we were <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>with all the demonstrations of welcome which they are accustomed to
<lb/>bestow on their chiefs. The idea seemed universal that with a missionary
<lb/>some great indefinite good had arrived. Many expected to be elevated
<lb/>at once to a condition equal to that of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> and inhabitants
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>, of which they had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> very exaggerated accounts; 
<lb/>others imagined that they would very soon be transformed into civilized
<lb/>men, possessing the clothing, horses, arms, <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>s, &amp;c. of Europeans,
<lb/>"<persName>Jesus</persName> had not loved their forefathers, hence their present degredation. He
<lb/>"had loved the white men, and given them all the wonderful things they
<lb/>"now possess. And as I had come to teach them to pray to Jesus, and to
<lb/>"pray for them, their means would soon be all supplied." A very
<lb/>great deal was expected too from medicines and my liberality in
<lb/>giving things I have <add place="above">not</add><add place="below">^</add> in my posession. Patient industry, and perseverance
<lb/>in learning were never thought of. The chief not yet nineteen years
<lb/>of age, frequently pressed me to name something I wished, so that
<lb/>he might by presenting it shew his affection, and I suspected,
<lb/>induce me forthwith to commence the work of metamorphosis
<lb/>by means of enchantments. But when I steadily refused to mention 
<lb/>any object I desired more than to secure their temporal and spiritual
<lb/>welfare by means of the gospel, he seemed to test my sincerity
<lb/>by presenting 4 small and 8 large elephant's tusks. I had not
<lb/>an opportunity of refusing them, as they were brought and laid down
<lb/>by <del type="strikethrough">my</del><add place="above">the</add><choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> during my absence. And then the chief came and
<lb/>begged me so earnestly to accept them I felt at a loss how to act.
<lb/>In other circumstances, I should have felt no hesitation in appropriating
<lb/>them to defray expenses incurred entirely on account of this people.  
<lb/>But as it was, though I had no <add place="above">direct</add><add place="below">^</add> evidence that the chief's object was
<lb/>such as I have described, the mere suspicion led me when departing
<lb/>for the <placeName><region>Barotse country</region></placeName>, to request him to leave orders that if any
<lb/>traders came my <choice><sic>wory</sic><corr>worry</corr></choice> must be used as well as his own. By
<lb/>this means no offence was given which might have been the case  
<lb/>had I at once sent them back. Some months were spent here.
<lb/>for though I soon proposed to examine the country in order to
<lb/>discover a suitable locality for a mission, <persName>Sekeletu</persName> objected first
<lb/>that he had not yet had a satisfactory look at me. He must
<lb/>see me longer. Then he could not think of allowing me to go <add place="below">alone</add><!-- Alone is obviously a catchword as it is the first line of the next page...how do we code to reflect? HB 9-2-13 -->

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000800_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>alone. He must accompany me and see that no evil <choice><sic>befel</sic><corr>befell</corr></choice> me. This required
<lb/>considerable preparation, during which I offered to teach the people to read
<lb/>Long and profound were the deliberations over this. They are never in
<lb/>a hurry in <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName>, and reading seems so supernatural; it cannot be
<lb/>explained to those who know nothing of letters. At last the chief told
<lb/>me that he was "afraid that learning to read might change his heart,
<lb/>and make him content with one wife only, as in the case of <persName>Sechele</persName>" It
<lb/>was in vain to urge that the altered state of mind contemplated would be
<lb/>as voluntary as the present. -- So underhand means would be employed
<lb/>to convert, all the means employed being open teaching. -- There is no compulsion
<lb/>The truth is taught respecting God's will and the belief or unbelief of the
<lb/>instructed is left as an affair between their judge and themselves.
<lb/>It was just as I have felt in my early years in contemplating that
<lb/>everlasting preaching praying &amp; singing prolonged into Heaven. Quite
<lb/>failing to realize the altered state of mind which produces a relish for
<lb/>such service it seemed as if celestial joys might be endured, rather
<lb/>than be consigned to the other quarter. As I was then subjected to
<lb/>repeated attacks of the <term type="ailment">Fever</term>, I did not press the subject long. But 
<lb/>when we returned from the <placeName><region>Barotse</region></placeName>, an experiment of which I
<lb/>have reason to be satisfied was set on foot. <persName>Sekeletu</persName>'s Father in law
<lb/>and step-father were appointed to learn to read in order that their
<lb/>experience may serve as a beacon to others. Though the plan exhibits
<lb/>the extreme of <term type="nationality">African</term> caution, they applied themselves so rigorously
<lb/>they and several others mastered the Alphabet perfectly in one day.
<lb/>But teaching to read being less my object in this journey than
<lb/>preaching the gospel of peace while endeavoring to discover
<lb/>a salubrious locality for a mission, I shall proceed to relate
<lb/>our visit to the <placeName><region>Barotse country</region></placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>Two sketches are enclosed, one long and large as just as I put <!-- At this line begins a large bracket around the paragraph in the left-margin HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>it down as we went along. The other small- reduced to the Latitudes
<lb/>&amp; Longitutdes according <add place="above">to</add><add place="below">^</add> observations taken as opportunities occurred.
<lb/>The large is sent in order that you may see several remarks,
<lb/>which my pen is not fine enough to insert in the reduced scale.
<lb/>and in order that if necessary a more correct reduction may be made.
<lb/>We embarked on the river called everywhere <geogName type="river">Leeambye</geogName> at the village
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="village">Sekhosi</settlement></placeName>. our fleet consisting of 33 canoes and our company of
<lb/>about 160 men. From the bend at <placeName>Katrina-molelo</placeName>up to the
<lb/>commencement of the <placeName><geogName type="valley">Barotse valley</geogName></placeName>, the country is covered by
<lb/>forest and Tsetse. The country otherwise seemed well adapted for
<lb/>a residence. Many villages of <term type="tribe">Banyeti</term>, a poor but industrious
<lb/>people are situated on both banks. They are expert as hunters
<lb/>of hippopotami &amp; other animals. They cultivate grain too extensively
<lb/>At the bend above named commences the rocky bottom which
<lb/>forms cataracts and rapids all the way up to the <placeName><region>Barotse</region></placeName>. The
<lb/>river is of very great beauty and breadth. In the Southern
<lb/>confines of Latitude 16° the high banks open to leave the 
<lb/>river and stretch away to the <choice><abbr>N.N.E.</abbr><expan>North North East</expan></choice> and <choice><abbr>N.N.W.</abbr><expan>North North West</expan></choice><choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> between <!-- Just wanted to confirm these directions are indeed N and not S (DL has similar ones) HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>twenty and thirty miles apart. The intervening space is <del type="cancelled">the</del>
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Barotse country</region></placeName> and is annually <choice><sic>innundated</sic><corr>inundated</corr></choice> as lower

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000800_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/><placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName> is by the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName>. The valley is covered with coarse succulent grasses
<lb/>which are the pasturage of large herds of cattle during a portion of the year.
<lb/>There are many villages of <term type="tribe">Markololo</term> in the valley. I have not put down
<lb/>all that I visited and many were seen in the distance. But there are
<lb/>no large towns. The reasons are the mounds on which alone towns
<lb/>and villages all built are small. And the people require to be separate
<lb/>on account of being rich in cattle. <placeName><settlement type="town">Nariele</settlement></placeName> does not contain 1000
<lb/>inhabitants. The ridges are thickly strewed with villages. The people
<lb/><term type="tribe">Banyeti</term> and <term type="tribe">Barotse</term> are not rich in cattle but they require to
<lb/>live apart on account of cultivating large gardens of sugar cane
<lb/>sweet potato, manioc, yams. millet maize &amp;c &amp;c. The exhalations
<lb/>which arise from a valley 20 miles broad and about 100 long produce
<lb/><term type="ailment">Fever</term> which is very fatal even among natives. It prevails most
<lb/>virulently when the waters of inundation are retiring. We went
<lb/>North till we came to the junction of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeba</geogName></placeName> or <placeName><geogName type="river">Londa</geogName></placeName> with the
<lb/>main stream <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeambye</geogName></placeName> in 14° 11' south Lat. and found the country
<lb/>presenting the same characteristics as I have described. On returning
<lb/>towards <placeName><settlement type="town">Nariele</settlement></placeName> I went to the <placeName><geogName type="feature">Eastern ridge</geogName></placeName> in order to examine
<lb/>that and see the establishment of a Merchant from the farthest
<lb/>inland station of the <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term>, opposite <placeName><settlement type="town">Benguela</settlement></placeName>. A stockade had
<lb/>been erected, and a flagstaff for the <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> banner planted. The houses
<lb/>of the merchant and some bastards were in the <term type="nationality">West African</term> style. The
<lb/>owner whom I had previously seen at <placeName><region>Linyanti</region></placeName> was absent but his
<lb/><add place="above">servants</add><add place="below">^</add> did their utmost to shew me kindness. When my boatmen prepared my
<lb/>bed outside, They insisted on my occupying their master's couch, and I
<lb/>never felt so grateful in my life for a warm shelter for I was in the
<lb/>cold stage of one of the <term type="ailment">intermittents</term> which continue to plague me after
<lb/>the <term type="ailment">Fever</term>. I thought of going Westward in company with this merchant
<lb/>but the sight of gangs of poor wretches in chains at the stockade
<lb/>moved me resolve to proceed alone. I have not, I am sorry
<lb/>to confess, discovered a healthy locality. The whole of the country of
<lb/><placeName><country>Sebituane</country></placeName> is unhealthy. The current of the river is rapid as far as
<lb/>we went, and shewed we must have been on an elevated table
<lb/>land. Yet the inundations cause the <term type="ailment">fever</term> to prevail very extensively.
<lb/>I am at a loss what to do, But will not give up the case as
<lb/>hopeless. Shame upon us if we are to be outdone by slave traders.
<lb/>I met <term type="nationality">Arabs</term> from <placeName><region>Zanzibar</region></placeName>, subjects of the <persName>Imanin of Muscat</persName>
<lb/>who had been quite <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice> the <placeName><region>continent</region></placeName>. They wrote Arabic readily <!-- Should Arabic be tagged because a language? And if yes, how coded? HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>in my note book and boldly avowed taht Mahomet was the greatest
<lb/>of all the prophets. In pursuance of a nobler object than theirs
<lb/>I have determined to try and <choice><sic>fulfil</sic><corr>fulfill</corr></choice> the second part of my enterprise
<lb/><add place="marginleft"><choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice></add> open up a way to the coast. I give the <placeName><region>West</region></placeName> the preference because
<lb/>it is nearer. If my calculations are right, the Longitudes of the
<lb/>map of last year are all wrong. The <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> stand for instance instead
<lb/>of being in 26° is 23° 48' or 50'. I have repeated the calculations
<lb/>of Lunar distances again and again and always with the same result
<lb/>But I do not wish this error published <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> I hear from the 
<lb/>Astronomers at the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> to whom I have submitted the

    

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000800_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>observations and also some occultations by which to test them. But
<lb/>for the destruction of my celestial map by the Boers I might have
<lb/>determined the Longitudes by occultations alone, they being much more
<lb/>to be depended on than the commmon method of Lunar distances. If then
<lb/>I am right we are nearer the <placeName><region>west</region></placeName> than the <placeName><region>East coast</region></placeName>. <placeName><settlement type="town">Nariele</settlement></placeName> is on
<lb/>23° East and the confluence of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeba</geogName></placeName> or <placeName><geogName type="river">Londa</geogName></placeName> not much more.
<lb/>I have not had time to work out the Longitude of that point but the
<lb/>river <add place="above"><placeName><geogName type="river">(Leeba)</geogName></placeName></add><add place="below">^</add> comes from the capital of a powerful state whose chief is
<lb/>reported to be friendly to foreigners. If I am permitted to return by
<lb/>this chieftain it will be water carriage for perhaps <choice><orig>⅔</orig><reg>2/3</reg></choice><hi rend="sup">ds</hi> of the way.
<lb/>And should a mission be established there in time it will be all the
<lb/>better - I intend to try for <placeName><settlement type="town">Loanda</settlement></placeName> because though farther many
<lb/><term type="nationality">English</term> live there. I go on horseback. <choice><orig>Waggon</orig><reg>Wagon</reg></choice> travelling being reported
<lb/>impossible on account of forests and numerous rivers. The <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term>
<lb/>are carried <unclear reason="stain"><supplied cert="medium">up</supplied></unclear> in hammocks hung on poles. Two slaves carry a man
<lb/>It does not look well. The <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> maps are all constructed from
<lb/>native reports, so no <choice><sic>dependance</sic><corr>dependence</corr></choice> can be placed on them. Many tribes
<lb/>inhabit the country all more or less accustomed to the visits of
<lb/>strangers. The greatest difficulty I apprehend is that of making our
<lb/>objects understood. Their languages bear a close affinity to the <placeName><region>Barotse</region></placeName><!-- Should Barotse be termed as region, language, or tribe here? HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>dialect but this I was compelled to give up reducing.</p><!-- This line has a horizontal line drawn through the width of the page -->
<lb/><p>I never had a touch of the <term type="ailment">Fever</term> till my employment became
<lb/>sedentary here. I have had eight attacks since the last when going
<lb/>North of <placeName><settlement type="town">Nariele</settlement></placeName> was very severe, being accompanied with large
<lb/>loss of florid blood. It thinned me much. But on no occasion
<lb/>did I lie <!-- How to code "lie" as it was overwritten on "lay"? HB 9-2-13 --> by. Fits of vertigo probably from exhaustion troubled
<lb/>me for some time. Everything seemed to rush to the left and I had
<lb/>to lay hold on something to prevent a fall. These induced me to give
<lb/>up collecting <placeName><region>Barotse</region></placeName> words and other materials for a dictionary. <!-- Should Barotse be termed as region, language, or tribe here? HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>Though still thin the <term type="ailment">intermittents</term> have left, and I am only waiting for
<lb/>the rain to commence to start for the <placeName><region>West</region></placeName>. They begin next month
<lb/>It will be seen that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi><choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> had better not come to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> to
<lb/>meet me at the time appointed. If I reach <placeName><settlement type="town">Loanda</settlement></placeName> in <date when="1854-02">February</date>
<lb/>I must return with the people again and will be here instead of
<lb/>at the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>. The time unavoidably lost by Boers and <term type="ailment">Fever</term>
<lb/>renders a little extension of my furlough necessary. Then if the
<lb/>Directors sanction a permanent station or any other form of
<lb/>labour for this miserable <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>, some other mode of travelling
<lb/>in from the <placeName><region>west</region></placeName> must be arranged. A few kind words
<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> from you, will I think make her willing to prolong
<lb/>her stay in <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName>. Although the prospect seems dark for
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> it may not be quite so gloomy as I have drawn
<lb/>it The natives describe the mortality as very great and that
<lb/>attacks of <term type="ailment">fever</term> are excessively frequent &amp; severe. I have given
<lb/>you their ideas. But my own except at times are not so sombre 
<lb/>I tried native remedies in some of the attacks to which I was
<lb/>subjected in order to discover if they had any valuable means of 
<lb/>cure but After being stewed in <unclear cert="low">reapont</unclear> baths, and smoked <del type="strikethrough">in</del>
<lb/>over fires of green plants in hot potsherds &amp;c &amp; I find that our 
<lb/>own medicines are much more efficacious and safer. I have not lost

    

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000800_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/>a single patient by <term type="ailment">fever</term>. And if I had been able <supplied cert="high">to</supplied> regulate my diet I should
<lb/>not have been subjected to so many attacks. As it was we were frequently
<lb/>compelled to eat on the principle of laying in a stock for the next day. My
<lb/>own people being too weak to go with me and the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> cook only in the
<lb/>evenings when travelling. Then if I left the canoe in order to visit a village
<lb/>there are <del type="cancelled">soo</del><add place="above">so</add> many branches of the river intersecting the valley everywhere
<lb/>I was always wet up to the middle. I fear to give you either a too <w>encourag<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-ing</w> or discouraging report. I am afraid to incur the responsibility of
<lb/>inducing you to regard the case as hopeless. The <term type="nationality">American</term> missionaries
<lb/>report the <placeName><region>Gaboan</region></placeName> station as not warranting the long established belief
<lb/>that Europeans could not live there. And my firm conviction is
<lb/>that even the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> of <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> merits a fair trial. Such with the
<lb/>help of God and your sanction I am determined to give it.)</p><!-- There's an end parenthesis here but no opening one earlier. --><!-- This line has a horizontal line drawn through the width of the page-->
<lb/><p>The slave trade was prohibited here, and a large party of <term type="tribe">Mambari</term>
<lb/>who were here endeavoring in vain to renew it, fled precipitately as
<lb/>soon as they heard that I had crossed the <placeName><geogName type="river">Chobe</geogName></placeName>. The <term type="tribe">Makololo</term><w>remon-
<lb break="no"/>strated</w> with them but they asserted that I would take all their
<lb/>goods from them because they dealt in slaves. A <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term>
<lb/>came from the <placeName><region>West</region></placeName> but he finding no market remained only
<lb/>three days and returned. It was different in the <placeName><region>Barotse</region></placeName> or
<lb/><placeName><region>Northern division</region></placeName> of the country. Another <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> merchant
<lb/>came thither and by means of an underchief who had some
<lb/>pretensions to the chieftainship obtained free access to all the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Banyeti</term>, <term type="tribe">Batoka</term> and <term type="tribe">Bashukulorupo</term> villages East of the
<lb/><geogName type="river">Leeambye</geogName>. <unclear cert="medium">There</unclear> the stockade which gave great offense to the <!-- "There" looks to have been written over Then, but cannot be 100% certain HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term> was erected without the knowledge or permission
<lb/>of the chief. They would have comenced hostilities at
<lb/>once in order to drive the whole slavetrading party out of
<lb/>the country but a variety of considerations induced me to
<lb/>intercede for them and by that intercession they will be allowed
<lb/>to depart in peace. Probably <choice><sic>decieved</sic><corr>deceived</corr></choice> by the assurances
<lb/>of the disaffected underchief they seem to have had no idea
<lb/>of the risk they were running. But when the conspirator
<lb/>came down with the intention of cutting off <persName>Sekeletu</persName>, He was
<lb/>instantly seized and killed. His fathers and several others <!-- "s" in "fathers" is fading- how code if <gap> doesn't allow for text within brackets? HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>were cut off in the most cold blooded manner. And when I <w>remon-
<lb break="no"/><choice><sic>stated</sic><corr>strated</corr></choice></w> against the shedding of human blood, the counsellors
<lb/>quietly remarked, "You see we are still Boers, we are not
<lb/>yet taught" But for this unfortunate affair no trading
<lb/>in slaves would have been allowed. In this they have the precedent
<lb/>of the former chief of the <term type="tribe">Barotse</term> who refused to grant the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Mambari</term> permission to visit his country as slave traders
