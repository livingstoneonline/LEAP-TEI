<lb/><p>My Dear friend</p>
<lb/><p>I am now two letters in debt to you. One I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> on 
<lb/>the <date when="1843-02-22">22<hi rend="sup">d</hi><choice><abbr>Feb.</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice></date> last when I was on the way towards the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> the other 
<lb/>I found a few days ago on my return &amp; now while I thank you 
<lb/>heartily for them both I shall try to pay off the debt. This is for 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Pyne</persName> the other I shall address to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pyne</persName> and though I think of 
<lb/>you as "joined together" I <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be in the least offended though 
<lb/>you each take separate sheets when you think of me. <w>Every<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>thing</w> you mention is interesting so you must not think your 
<lb/>letter valueless. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> advert to the topic contained in yours 
<lb/>because I think you will be more pleased with things relating 
<lb/>to this country. In this letter however I shall deviate from my 
<lb/>usual customs. I beg however to say that though I do not 
<lb/>recur to the topic mentioned in yours on paper &amp; often 
<lb/>recur to them in sport. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> feel overcomplacent
<lb/>towards <persName><choice><abbr>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi></abbr><expan>Thomas</expan></choice> Prentice</persName> he got <persName>Miss Pudley</persName> simply because he 
<lb/>was intending to be a missionary. This was the stepping stone 
<lb/>by which he gained her affections, now he sticks up at home 
<lb/>in a miserable climate, &amp; I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> expect he will enjoy much 
<lb/>happines apart from sickness.  I am truly sorry to hear 
<lb/>of the sickness of <persName>Salome Ceal</persName> &amp; intend writing her parents by 
<lb/>this same opportunity. I earnestly hope the means used have 
<lb/>proved effectual. I have had a letter from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Drummond</persName>
<lb/>He writes me he says first as he had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> my letter before 
<lb/>those of any others. He had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> yours &amp; expected the small 
<lb/>boxes soon.  He has gone to <placeName><settlement type="village">Savaii</settlement></placeName>.  Navigators.  But I am 
<lb/>pretty certain you have also <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> a letter or letters from him 
<lb/>&amp; will not on that account say more about him. O I beg 
<lb/>his pardon I must tell you the <choice><sic>worlds</sic><corr>world's</corr></choice> population has been 
<lb/>augmented by a unit in the person of <persName>Jean <choice><abbr>D.</abbr><expan>Drummond</expan></choice></persName> the daughter of <persName>Rev 
<lb/><choice><abbr>G.D.</abbr><expan>George Drummond</expan></choice></persName> of <placeName type="village">Savaii</placeName> He says "a prettier sweeter little creature was never 
<lb/>seen by me nor any other old <choice><sic>batchelor</sic><corr>bachelor</corr></choice> like me" This of course 
<lb/>I feel much obliged by your kindness in sending me the box you 
<lb/>mention. It has not yet arrived but I expect it shall by <persName>Mr 
<lb/>Nighs</persName> whom we expect next month. I cannot say that I 
<lb/>have all things I need but I most certainly prefer to be <gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="low">explain</supplied>
<lb/>getting a little assistance now &amp; then from kind friends like 
<lb/>yourself &amp; feeling both a light purse &amp; light heart to being <w>encum<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>bered</w> with such a load as good <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> brings with him 
<lb/>You tell me a secret I shall tell you one in return He has 
<lb/>no less than 50 tons of goods &amp; luggage with him. We poor 
<lb/>ignorant things here hold up our hands in amazement &amp; say 
<lb/>better he have them than we. I feel much obliged to you 
<lb/>for your suggestion respecting the watch but I feel quite out 
<lb/>of humours with <choice><sic>&amp; it</sic><corr>it &amp;</corr></choice> its maker. It is only valuable to me 
<lb/>now as proof of your disinterseted kindness. I feel disinclined 
<lb/>to have anything more to do with <persName>Yonge</persName>. Perhaps sometime when 
<lb/>I become rich I shall buy another. At present I am content with 
<lb/>the sun as my guide. However if I see a good opportunity

<lb/>yet avail myself of your willingess to serve me. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Williams</persName> of 
<lb/><placeName type="village">Hankey</placeName> is at present in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. He has taken that step in 
<lb/>consequence of a disease in throat. He wished much to come up 
<lb/>here &amp; go with me to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> but after all was prepared 
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="town">Algoa Bay</settlement></placeName> a doctor there declared that the season was too 
<lb/>far advanced &amp; the attempt might cost him his life. What nonsense 
<lb/>There is not a finer climate in the world. I hope going home 
<lb/>wont cost him his life. He was an excellent man. I have requested 
<lb/>him to call upon you. I wish he may I only saw him for a 
<lb/>short time but I love him as much as if he had been the <w>comp<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>anion</w> of my boyhood. If he should come &amp; spend a day with 
<lb/>you, you would be delighted with him. He is a real good warm
<lb/>hearted <term type="nationality">welshman</term>. I hope he will find it convenient. I intend to 
<lb/>send a few things to you immediately they are so few I am 
<lb/>ashamed to send them alone, &amp; as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>Williams</expan></choice></persName> desires me to purchase 
<lb/>for him a few karosses I shall send yours in the same box 
<lb/>But you mush not think this is the box I promised you 
<lb/>I send these as a rememberance &amp; pledge of a greater expression of my 
<lb/>regard at some future time. I would have sent you a greater number 
<lb/>of karosses but I am informed that the duty on them is very great 
<lb/>&amp; I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> like to put the professor to over much expense. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Williams</persName> desires me to send him karosses as a mode of 
<lb/>transmitting money for some articles which I must be in want of &amp; 
<lb/>which he is anxious to serve me by purchasing for me. I 
<lb/>shall write you again when I send off the box &amp; specify all 
<lb/>the articles it contains for you. They will be put into two 
<lb/>seperate parcels so that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>W.</abbr><expan>Williams</expan></choice></persName> will perfectly understand 
<lb/>what is intended for you. The camel thorn I shall procure without 
<lb/>difficulty. The wood is what we <del type="strikethrough">burn</del><add place="above">use</add> as fuel &amp; it is as you will 
<lb/>see by the specimen very hard. Insects I have not been able 
<lb/>to preserve with the exception of a few locusts But in my next 
<lb/>I shall mention them all. <space dim="horizontal" extent="1" unit="words"/>O I forgot to give you all the secret 
<lb/>about the 50 tons Perhaps there not 20 worth the freight for 
<lb/>can you believe it there are some donors who give what
<lb/>they cant make the least use of themselves. They must  
<lb/>be old maids surely. Only think of lots of old dirty ball dresses 
<lb/>which the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term><choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> look at as they can be seen 
<lb/>through. Hundreds of old oblong silk buttons <figure/> which I remember to <!-- Not sure what the "figure" coding pertains to, so left as is HB 10/30/12 -->
<lb/>have seen on ladies dresses when I was a little boy. The old worn
<lb/>out coverings of parasols. Old starched shirt collars to people 
<lb/>who have no shirts. Together with nameless other old rubbish 
<lb/>of which the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> can make no earthly use. Really some 
<lb/>of the good people in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> seem to have consciences of 
<lb/><!-- cannot make out this word AJS 11/18 -->  Rubber.  Something <!-- cannot make out this word AJS 11/18 --> more for his transmissions 
<lb/>than would suffice to purchase new ones at <placeName><settlement type="village">Colesberg</settlement></placeName>. The 
<lb/>shirts with holes in them <choice><sic>to</sic><corr cert="high">too</corr></choice> bad I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> even make good 
<lb/>bandages to bind up sores with them. It is not want of 
<lb/>knowledge which makes them send such things. For you know 
<lb/>as little of what was proper as they do when you kindly gave 
<lb/>me your first box &amp; yet every article you gave was valuable 
<lb/>There was not a useless thing in it. And although I joked 
<lb/>you about the babies clothes it was because I did not then

<lb/>know that they could be useful in the hands of a <choice><sic>batchelor</sic><corr>bachelor</corr></choice>, they 
<lb/>have however been very useful in the hands of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> W. Phillip</persName> now of 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Hankey</settlement></placeName>. I would not now give all to her as I did then. All these things 
<lb/>are useful for the purpose of gaining the affections &amp; thereby leading the 
<lb/>natives to the Saviour.  our remarks about having on to <unclear cert="low">warm</unclear>
<lb/>to still that solitude is sweet I can fully understand, I have however 
<lb/>usually a good stock of spirits (not artificial) &amp; can bear up against 
<lb/>loneliness. But it sometimes requires all my philosophy especially when 
<lb/>away for months together from all European Society. The friends at <placeName><settlement type="village"><w>Griqua<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>town</w></settlement></placeName> imagined that I must be dying for want of a wife &amp; kindly sent  
<lb/>their daughter all the way to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> by way of experiment. When 
<lb/>that failed great anxiety was manifested to know who were my 
<lb/>female correspondents in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ross</persName>told them that I was 
<lb/>in love with a young widow in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> called <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Sewell</persName>!  My 
<lb/>letters to her have all failed in reaching their destinations ever since 
<lb/>She is now becoming angry with me for not writing <gap agent="fading" extent="2" unit="chars"/> this 
<lb/>account I beg leave to enclose one to her in yours. She has 
<lb/>always been most kind to me &amp; even now writes me regularly 
<lb/>sends my publications &amp;c although she never hears whether
<lb/>I recieve anything she sends unless she hears it from you 
<lb/>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know who destroys my letters to her but the above 
<lb/>circumstances make me suspicious of certain parties connected 
<lb/>with the Mission families at <placeName><settlement type="village">Griqua Town</settlement></placeName>. None of his 
<lb/><choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> here feel in any way satisfied with either <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> or M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ross</persName>
<lb/>They have most unhappy dispositions &amp; often <unclear cert="medium">queue</unclear> us all. You saw 
<lb/>his letter in the Chronicle. It gives such a false view <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><choice><abbr>R.</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName> felt 
<lb/>ashamed of it &amp; said <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>R.</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName> had not written the article so the conver<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb/>sion of <placeName><settlement type="Biblical">Babel</settlement></placeName>was as far as instrumentality is concerned to be attribu<gap extent="3" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">ted</supplied>
<lb/>to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> alone. The first day I was in the church I obse<gap extent="4" unit="chars" agent="hole"/>
<lb/><persName>Baba</persName> weeping under <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>s preaching. We were all astounded 
<lb/>at the change which we were told had taken place in him.  
<lb/>But when <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>told of his <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">former</add> desparate wickedness <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>R.</abbr><expan>Ross</expan></choice></persName> insisted that 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">that</del> his deeds such as offering to shoot his father were merely 
<lb/>boyish tricks. You would imagine that he could preach when 
<lb/>he wrote that letter. He cannot even now give an address 
<lb/>without reading it &amp; after all that is very little understood 
<lb/>by the natives. In common conversation he interlaids it with 
<lb/>English. The natives have first to guess at what he means 
<lb/>I often feel dissatisfied with myself and think there are 
<lb/>many far better for this great work who have not been 
<lb/>permitted to enter upon<gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="hole"/> it But when I see <persName>Ross's</persName><gap extent="3" unit="chars" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>I am constrained to think there are some worse <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="hole"/>
<lb/>was a great oversight in <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> to recommend such a 
<lb/>man. <space dim="horizontal" unit="chars" extent="6"/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> &amp; I &amp; perhaps <persName>Nighs</persName> will go in the 
<lb/>course of a few months to commence a mission among 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>. I gave you some account of them on a former 
<lb/>occasion. <del type="cancelled"><gap extent="1" unit="words"/></del> it is the <placeName><settlement type="city">Sheffield</settlement></placeName> of the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. And 
<lb/>very near the spot where <persName><choice><abbr>J.</abbr><expan>John</expan></choice> Campbell</persName> faced about to 
<lb/>go home. He heard of oven <choice><sic>founderies</sic><corr>foundries</corr></choice> but was 
<lb/>not permitted to see them. These are still in existence 
<lb/>&amp; belong to the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>, the reason why they did not 
<lb/>allow him to look at them was they were afraid his 
<lb/>presence should bewitch the oven. A mishap which 

       

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000529_0004"><!--pb/@n='10v'--></pb>
<lb/>always takes place when they blow too hard &amp; burn it. They 
<lb/>then take out the <unclear cert="medium">cinder</unclear> &amp; look upon it in consternation.  
<lb/>It is clearly bewitched. The evidence is so positive no one can 
<lb/>doubt it. It is also near to the spot where <persName>Sebegoe</persName> with the 
<lb/>remains of his tribe have taken up their abode. I smiled when 
<lb/>you said you almost trembled to think of my going as far North 
<lb/>&amp; into the same dangers as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>. I should have trembled 
<lb/>as had I been at home &amp; thought of it. But the sense of danger 
<lb/>vanishes when you are in a country of lions. I have been 
<lb/>as far if not farther on the other side of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName>s <del type="cancelled"/><add place="above">fartherest</add>
<lb/>point North as that is on the other side of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> and 
<lb/>in a country too where the lions are so plentiful they are

<lb/>He has been driven away North by the <choice><orig><sic>boors</sic></orig><corr>Boors</corr><reg>Boers</reg></choice> but is still living

<lb/>over the site of his town when I was returning. The 
<lb/>whole country was bare the grass having been littered 
<lb/>off so I had a good view of the whole &amp; a few

<lb/>I could discover of all the greatness of the tyrant 
<lb/>When I was lately at the <placeName><settlement type="village">Makalaka</settlement></placeName> I saw some of his
