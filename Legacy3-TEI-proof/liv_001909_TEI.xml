<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Waller</persName></p>
<lb/><p><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Mells</persName> very
<lb/>willingly volunteered 
<lb/>to run down &amp; see 
<lb/><persName>Procter</persName>, and I hope 
<lb/>your mind will 
<lb/>be relieved somewhat 
<lb/>by his Presence and 
<lb/><persName>Procter</persName> by his advice.

<lb/>I have no objection

<lb/>I take - this ill as 
<lb/>it takes me aback 
<lb/>while had I been 
<lb/>forewarned I should 
<lb/>have had all in

<lb/>their time and more 
<lb/>But I am not down 
<lb/>hearted I feel rather

<lb/>most of the money 
<lb/>spent on this Expedition
<lb/>has not been on 
<lb/>the objects primarily 
<lb/>in view but in 
<lb/>birds beetle &amp;

<lb/>crowded around

<lb/>for a man in his 
<lb/>speciality. I yielded 
<lb/>and in order to 
<lb/>give each an opportunity 
<lb/>of distinguishing him 
<lb/>self allowed all 
<lb/>his collections to go 
<lb/>home in his own 
<lb/>name and in his 
<lb/>own change. We shall 
<lb/>see if this leads to 
<lb/>the mineral and 
<lb/>vegetable wealth <!-- End of "vegetable" looks garbled- possibly s/r at end? Not sure at all, but wanted to make note of it HB 1/4/12 -->

<lb/>looking around on

<lb/>I feel with <persName>Lord

<lb/>I sympathize in

<lb/>but what are they 
<lb/>for but to be

<lb/>like a perfect 
<lb/>heathen on our
