<lb/><p rend="left">Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p>Before this letter can reach you, you may have concluded that I have 
<lb/>fogotten my promise to write you concerning your son <persName>Manning</persName>. But many 
<lb/>reasons have induced me to delay and when I reflect on the different feelings 
<lb/>which agitated my mind as circumstances connected with missions in the country 
<lb/>were made known to me.  I am glad I have been prevented from writing you 
<lb/>sooner. Had I written you before this very probably the communications 
<lb/>would have had a tinge of what was at the time causing me either joy or 
<lb/>grief. for I daresay you know that though in the Mission field there are 
<lb/>many things which it would be well for the people in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> to know. Mere 
<lb/>are others which it is well they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know. Here I am quite <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">as much</add> separated from 
<lb/>both the failings &amp; excellences of the missionary community as you are, and have 
<lb/>been so for some months. I think I shall on that account be able to give 
<lb/>a calmer view of the state of matters so that you may form a correct 
<lb/>judgement of how you ought to act with respect to <persName>Manning</persName>. I have 
<lb/>written several times to <persName>Thomas</persName> &amp; have mentioned to him some of the things 
<lb/>which form the dark side of the picture. I feel very anxious on his account 
<lb/>for I fear that after all I can say that when he comes &amp; looks in matters 
<lb/>with different eyes <del type="cancelled">to</del> than mine he may feel disappointed. I fear he will 
<lb/>take a more pervasive view than I do, for you will <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">have</add> seen if you have 
<lb/>looked into my letters that I have fear too much levity in my composition 
<lb/>This is not as it ought to be but I always felt, when writing, not in 
<lb/><placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> but in <placeName><settlement type="town">Gower <choice><abbr>Ct.</abbr><expan cert="high">Court</expan></choice></settlement></placeName>. You must therefore make allowances for this 
<lb/>failing of mine. Adding to the difficulties your sons will encounter the <w>sad- 
<lb break="no"/>ness</w> which arises from being <del type="cancelled">a</del> stranger in a strange land. I fear for them 
<lb/>on this account. <hi rend="underline">It will be</hi> a sacrifice for them to make. I believe it is to 
<lb/>most. And I almost wish it were to me to sober me down a little</p>
<lb/><p>Neither <persName>Thomas</persName> nor <persName>Manning</persName> must for a moment think of settling in 
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> or even in <placeName><settlement type="town">Caffreland</settlement></placeName>. If they come at all it must be to the 
<lb/><placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. If they halt before they reach the Tropic the spot where I now write 
<lb/>they had much better remain in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. I shall endeavour to explain 
<lb/>just what one would wish them to be But it would seems these 
<lb/>are not sufficient for the people or rather for the missionaries 
<lb/>You find missionaries in some places better supplied with his bread 
<lb/>of life than many of <del type="strikethrough">of</del> like size in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. There is <placeName><settlement type="village">Algoa  
<lb/>Bay</settlement></placeName> This village is certainly not larger perhaps not so large as 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Ongar</settlement></placeName> but it has a Roman Catholic, a Wesleyan, &amp; one of our <w>miss<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>ionaries</w> with one of our schoolmasters who preaches to the blacks 
<lb/>His clergymen besides but as neither he nor the Roman <choice><abbr>Cath.</abbr><expan>Catholic</expan></choice> nuns are 
<lb/>evangelical. I shall say three evangelical missionaries to a place 
<lb/>the size of <placeName><settlement type="town">Ongar</settlement></placeName>,<space dim="horizontal" extent="4" unit="chars"/><!-- cannot make word out, AJS --> a small town you will find 
<lb/>the population in a Gazetteer. They are chiefly the descendants of <term type="nationality">Dutch</term>
<lb/><!-- cannot make word out, AJS -->missionaries of our society, one of whom takes all the blacks under 
<lb/>his charge. A clergyman &amp; government schoolmaster who preaches  
<lb/>all evangelical: <placeName><settlement type="town">Gachin's Town</settlement></placeName> is quite an English place has also 
<lb/>one of our missionaries but not having seen it I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know 
<lb/>how large it is or how supplied by other societies. <persName>Graaf Rennet</persName></p>
	<ab>
<lb/><date when="1842-04-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May</date> By a letter to <persName>Thomas</persName>of this date I inform him of the reasons which prevented my going westward as 
<lb/>mentioned in this but I hope my coming here will also be attended by good to souls. Yours <space dim="horizontal" extent="6" unit="chars"/><choice><abbr>DL.</abbr><expan>David Livingstone</expan></choice></ab>

<lb/><p>has a most excellent clergyman &amp; our missionary is his curate. <persName>Colesbery</persName>
<lb/>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> believe it has more than 500 of a population. A Wesleyan, <!-- word unclear MS -->
<lb/>of ours &amp; a clergyman all evangelical. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> say anything <del type="cancelled">more</del> of the 
<lb/>real mission <!-- word unclear MS --> such as thanking <!-- word unclear probably a placeName MS -->, Rat River <!-- don't know about this coding MS --> &amp;c 
<lb/>There ought to be &amp; are all supplied with missionaries.  But I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> help 
<lb/>thinking that the poor Christians in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> are defended by the rich 
<lb/><term type="nationality">English</term> people in these towns above mentioned who detain missionaries 
<lb/>amongst them. Some of them indeed such as <placeName><settlement type="town">Graham's Town</settlement></placeName> rai<del type="cancelled"/>
<lb/>as much as pays the salary of their pastor. But then the expense of 
<lb/>outfit &amp;c. and in some instances education too (<persName>Robson</persName>) stands a black 
<lb/>debt unliquidated. If missionaries are detained by <term type="nationality">English</term> people I suppose 
<lb/>justice requires that they should in addition to defraying all expenses of the 
<lb/>missionary send another on to the destination appointed by the Directors 
<lb/>If not they defend the real heathen for to them these missionaries 
<lb/>were appointed. <persName>Mr Robson</persName> for instance was appointed to <placeName><settlement type="village">Lattabao</settlement></placeName>-- 
<lb/>Perhaps however it is not the fault of the <term type="nationality">English</term> population. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know 
<lb/>I will not condemn my <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> But all of them with whom I convened 
<lb/>seemed anxious to impress my mind with the idea that they had very large 
<lb/>spheres of usefulness (Perhaps they have I however could not see it in 
<lb/>the same light they did). And if they have spoken so to the Directors of course 
<lb/>the fault does not lie with them. It is not in the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> as it is in <placeName><country>India</country></placeName>
<lb/>A missionary there can do more good by means of the liberality of the 
<lb/><term type="nationality">English</term> for support of schools than by attending exclusively to the natives 
<lb/>and the chieftains there are generally <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">not</add> evangelical. But here, whoever heard 
<lb/>of the liberality of the South African Colonist? Where is there either a school 
<lb/>or anything else <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> as the fruits of their liberality? The clergymen of the 
<lb/><term type="nationality">Dutch</term> church which is the established form are generally evangelical too 
<lb/>It is not pleasant to write these things, but it is absolutely necessary for one  
<lb/>to know them before he can judge of the spiritual wants of the country. Please 
<lb/><!-- word unclear MS --> to count the number of missionaries of all denomination.  The clergy 
<lb/>&amp; compare it with the amount of Colonial population. And I am sure 
<lb/>you will not appoint <persName>Manning</persName> to the <del type="cancelled"><unclear cert="medium">that</unclear></del> part of the country.</p>
<lb/><p>Now as to <placeName><settlement type="town">Caffretown</settlement></placeName>.  There are many missionaries in it &amp; there 
<lb/>of almost every society in existence. The habits of the <term type="tribe">Caffres</term> are unsocial 
<lb/>They do not congregate round one chief like the <term type="tribe">Bechwanas</term>, but each 
<lb/>lives with his few cattle &amp; dependants to retire by himself. the population 
<lb/>is therefore much scattered and one of the greatest difficulties is to get 
<lb/>a few families collected &amp; afterwards to keep them together. I do not 
<lb/>however speak of them from personal knowledge but from the 
<lb/>testimony of those who have had opportunities of examining the country
<lb/>They cannot either remain near <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. While the missionaries 
<lb/>in the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> may be heard in the towns expatiating on their large spheres 
<lb/>of usefulness More on this side the river especially the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> &amp; 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Griqua Town</settlement></placeName> missionaries are exchanging sour looks on account 
<lb/>of what they deem encroachments on each others spheres. <placeName><settlement type="village">Griqua 
<lb/>Town</settlement></placeName> by means of native teachers is expanding delightfully. I wish 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> would do the same. I heard a brother about 2 months ago 
<lb/>tell another then on a visit to <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> from about 100 miles East of it. That 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> wants bring out a reinforcement of missionaries to live at 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. What will they do here. O we shall itinerate occasionally to Towns! 
<lb/>and this the only heathen place in the neighborhood of our visitor to which

       

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000508_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>he can itinerate. On mentioning this to the <term type="nationality">French</term><choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> at <placeName><settlement type="village">Motecto</settlement></placeName>. 15 miles 
<lb/>North East of <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> "A reinforcement to <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName>" said they "will put us out altogether 
<lb/>we must leave all we have done &amp; seek a new people<hi rend="underline">"</hi>-- &amp; it will be 
<lb/>so. Unless the new missionaries go forward they will not have work 
<lb/>equal to what they might find in thousands of villages in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>The population is by no means dense. The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> consist of tribes each 
<lb/>of from 1 to 2000 in number. The <term type="tribe">Battapee</term>. This <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> Tribe is 
<lb/>however an exception, as it has from 10 to 12000, &amp; of which at least 
<lb/>are bitterly opposed to the gospel. You cannot have a large sphere 
<lb/>of usefulness here unless you come far into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> &amp; then although 
<lb/>residing at one spot you must extend your energies over a large 
<lb/>space by means of native teachers. I know about a dozen of <gap agent="illegible" extent="2" unit="chars"/>
<lb/>tribes beyond this all quite ignorant. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> much <gap agent="tear" extent="2" unit="chars"/><add place="inline" cert="high">ex</add>pect to understand

<lb/>can form a pretty correct idea of what you might meet after trav- 
<lb/>a degree of latitude between each. I earnestly recommend my Dear Friend 
<lb/><persName>Thomas</persName> if he is permitted in the providence of God to come here at all to determine 
<lb/>resolutely to preach the gospel in the regions beyond. <choice><sic>Dont</sic><corr>Don't</corr></choice> let him enter on another <!-- Word unclear MS -->
<lb/>line of things By bold determination I see nothing to hinder him along with <persName>Manning</persName>
<lb/>from <unclear cert="medium">earning</unclear> an interest which may <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">be</add> more useful to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> than any mission 
<lb/>Southward. I shall write <persName>Manning</persName> along with this explaining in what manner 
<lb/>he could be by the blessing of God as useful as any of us. It would also be better 
<lb/>for <persName>Miss R.</persName> than any where near <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>, for I think from her appearance 
<lb/>the bleak sterile prospects which that country affords would have a depressing 
<lb/>influence on her spirits &amp; ultimately induce <term type="ailment">disease</term>. The country gener<gap agent="waxseal" extent="4" unit="chars"/><!-- not sure about this MS -->

<lb/>appearance. The fields have a great profusion of low soggy bushes 
<lb/>(scarcely any trees) most of them arrived with thorns which <gap agent="hole" extent="1" unit="chars"/><supplied cert="high">a</supplied>re either bent 
<lb/>back like fish hooks or forwards in every direction but all villainously 
<lb/>sharp &amp; strong. The grass grows in little round clumps and there is more 
<lb/>stones &amp; sand between than bushes <del type="cancelled">shrubs</del> plants &amp; grass together.
<lb/>During one portion of the year at a distance it looks beautifully green
<lb/>But even then one <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> walk in the fields with any pleasure and 
<lb/>this is an exercise which she must take. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName> visited it 
<lb/>during the favourable season &amp; he speaks of some parts as equal 
<lb/>to <persName>Miahomet</persName>'s paradise. I spent a few days in that paradise at 
<lb/>a different season of the year &amp; I was most happy when I got 
<lb/>out of it. But as we approach the <placeName><region>Tropic</region></placeName> the country loses its browned 
<lb/>parched appearance. <gap extent="3" unit="chars" agent="hole"/> dwells here are covered all over with trees 
<lb/>the red sandstone rocks looking pleasantly out here &amp; there from 
<lb/>between them. But towards the South they are quite bare. There 
<lb/>the vegetation is quite tropical the nettle is no longer a mere plant 
<lb/>but grows up to a tree a foot or more in diameter &amp; from 20 to 
<lb/>30 in height. The wild figtree abounds on the mountains &amp; though it 
<lb/>yields little fruit, its presence indicated that fruits would thrive 
<lb/>better here than at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. I think all the Tropical fruits might 
<lb/>be reared here without much trouble.  Am immense amount of 
<lb/>manual labour has been expended on <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> to make it what 
<lb/>it is. All the trees had to be planted. Here you might select 
<lb/>a dozen sprouts for building each of them superior in picturesque 
<lb/>beauty to any mission I have seen &amp; the trees ready to your hand</p>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000508_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>I came here for the purpose of planting a native teacher with this portion of the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> tribe &amp; am thankful to say I have met with a reception which has 
<lb/>exceeded my expectations. It is all through the Loving kindness of our gracious 
<lb/>God. Blessed be his glorious name and may the whole earth soon see his glory 
<lb/>After three days I set off on a long journey directly West in order if possible 
<lb/>to prevent bloodshed. The whole of the Southern tribes having leagued together to 
<lb/>attack one lying in that direction. They are now on their way but if I can 
<lb/>be at it before them so as to apprise the chief of his danger their object 
<lb/>will be defeated. He &amp; the chief with whom I now am are the only men 
<lb/>of good sense I have seen of blood royal amongst <term type="tribe">Bechwanas</term>the alone of  
<lb/>all the <term type="tribe">Bechwanas</term> had the courage to defend himself against <persName>Moselekatse</persName> a

<lb/>shall have nothing for the oxen to drink but we hope to find a species of better 
<lb/>water melon on the sand &amp; if I can apprise him of his danger I have little 
<lb/>doubt his superior generalship will secure both him his people &amp; cattle 
<lb/>and gratitude I should think will induce him to receive another native 
<lb/>teacher gladly. I hope this will be the result of my doing as I should wish to 
<lb/>be done by. I do not fear the wrath of the Southern tribes. They are all 
<lb/>opposed to the gospel and those who do not love fear me. The general
