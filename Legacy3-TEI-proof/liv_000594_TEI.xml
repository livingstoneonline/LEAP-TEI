<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p rend="center">As <persName>Apie</persName> leaves tomorrow I begin
<lb/>another hurried scrawl. For the first time in my
<lb/>life I feel that my hands are really full. Too
<lb/>many irons in the fire over head &amp; ears and the
<lb/>rain will come I have no doubt. I came here
<lb/>last friday week &amp; after a fortnight<supplied cert="high">'</supplied>s sojourn
<lb/>intend to leave on thursday or friday next, my
<lb/>window frames must be done then. I am now
<lb/>busy at them. When the first row of thatch
<lb/>is on "I shall sleep a month" The letter to
<lb/>the Directors is not finished &amp; lies like an
<lb/>incubus on my mind. I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> make it
<lb/>to please myself. Tired out every night
<lb/>I fancy I feel like you in your <w>per-
<lb break="no"/>petual</w> bustle. I have been in bustles
<lb/>frequently but never felt as now But
<lb/>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> by the above ask help either
<lb/>sideways or anyways. I just speak
<lb/>as I feel. The more we toil here the
<lb/>sweeter rest will be. Let us look to
<lb/>the Heavenly rest &amp; peace with more
<lb/>intense desires. <persName>Mary</persName> I suppose will
<lb/>give all the news I have none</p>

<lb/>Thank you for the Music Book I am precentor now
<lb/>&amp; such a precentor! I am in agonies before
<lb/>I can screw out anything like a tune &amp; then <persName><unclear cert="low">Rira</unclear></persName> drowns
<lb/>me. I have to watch for a chink here and there in his voice

<lb/><p>I mentioned your <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>. As it was
<lb/>principally for the beads you will not
<lb/>of course send it now. Fear we do not
<lb/>thank you sufficiently for all the things
<lb/>sent It is not want of gratitude but want
<lb/>of thought prevents us enumerating all the
<lb/>things &amp; thanking for each May be the gratitude
<lb/>is not quite the thing either. Thank you
<lb/>for the barren cow consolation. It equals
<lb/>what one might have given the gravedigger's
<lb/>wife who complained of the hardness of the
<lb/>times. "Naething doing at a<del type="strikethrough">ll</del> noo, <persName>Jamie</persName> has na
<lb/>had a job for three weeks, I dinna ken hoe
<lb/>we can fen ava". I have got seeds of the
<lb/>gigantic tree 51 feet in diameter. Very
<lb/>good food, native testimony. The one
<lb/>I broke has a good flavour, you will
<lb/>taste. These are small. I have seen them as
<lb/>large as ostrich eggs. <persName>Oswal</persName> &amp; <persName>Murray</persName>
<lb/>may take them down. They were
<lb/>extremely kind to us. The former promises
<lb/>to send seeds from <placeName><country>India</country></placeName> &amp; the latter
<lb/>offered to do anything in his power in 
<lb/><placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName>. If I had had the money I

<lb/>should have entrusted him with an order
<lb/>for a magic lantern. It would be cheaper in
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Edinburgh</settlement></placeName> than <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> &amp; he being acquainted
<lb/>with many ship captains says he can send
<lb/>anything safely. Surgical instruments are <choice><orig>⅔</orig><reg>2/3</reg></choice><hi rend="sup">ds</hi>
<lb/>cheaper in <placeName><settlement type="city">Edinburgh</settlement></placeName> than <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>. Did you
<lb/>talk about <placeName><settlement type="city">Rome</settlement></placeName><foreign xml:lang="und">Masepa hela</foreign>. The account
<lb/>reconciled me to the <gap agent="illegible" extent="1" unit="words"/> of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>they talked frequently about <persName>Edwards</persName>. We
<lb/>could with difficulty answer their questions
<lb/>they were so pointed. But we avoided saying
<lb/>anything to shew we were obnoxious. He <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>has not however observed the same rule
<lb/>respecting us. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Murray</persName> said "<persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> is the 
<lb/>coarsest &amp; most uncouth man I ever saw
<lb/>I was ashamed to be seen in his <del type="cancelled">presence</del><add place="above">company</add>"
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Oswal</persName> said, <supplied cert="high">"</supplied>What is that tall queer looking
<lb/>man we saw at <placeName><settlement type="village">Motito</settlement></placeName>? "He seems to speak 
<lb/>as if he were always in a rage" Many
<lb/>questions were put to <persName>Mary</persName> when I was absent
<lb/>which shewed <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> had been going on
<lb/>at a fine rate to them. She felt very
<lb/>much at a loss what to answer. <add place="above">He</add> told
<lb/>them he intended to go all along the <placeName><region>East
<lb/>coast</region></placeName> before he returned. He likewise told
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Greig</persName> that he intended doing wonders in
<lb/>the travelling line northwards. How daring
<lb/>I was to make such a one an appendix

<lb/>Whether he has done anything or not when last 
<lb/>here or whether it is merely the effect of
<lb/>knowing that we shall leave, the people
<lb/>now <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> turn out to the meetings. We
<lb/>have not a quarter of the former number
<lb/>so I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> feel bound to remain here longer
<lb/>than I can help. Before his visit
<lb/>the house was generally quite full, since then
<lb/>we have scarcely ever <choice><orig>⅓</orig><reg>1/3</reg></choice> of the former number
<lb/>The only relaxation we have is half an
<lb/>hour in the garden before sun set <w>trans-
<lb break="no"/>-planting</w>. <persName>Mary</persName> is a real gardener &amp; enjoys
<lb/>this much when not too tired. She is
<lb/>wonderfully well. We have had some
<lb/>dishes of Scotch Kale, spinach, leaves
<lb/>of Mangold Wurzil, carrots an inch in
<lb/>diameter. Lettuces we shall have in abundance
<lb/>&amp; broccoli &amp; cabbages &amp; turnips ad nauseum
<lb/>endure in abundance but we <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know
<lb/>how to eat all our good things. Perhaps
<lb/>I shall turn out a half gardener at my
<lb/>ain hand like the boys <unclear cert="medium">brither</unclear><persName>Jock</persName> &amp;
<lb/>the <unclear cert="medium">diel</unclear> at sinning. I like it very much
<lb/>Many thanks for the vine cuttings. When you
<lb/>come you must give me some instructions
<lb/>Send out some oats &amp; barley from <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>The latter is perhaps superior, the former may
	<cb/>
<lb/>go to comfort the stomachs of <persName>Ann</persName>'s winged friends if
<lb/>you <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> like to sow it.</p>
