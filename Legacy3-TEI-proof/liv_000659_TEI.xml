<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p>We gladly welcomed our friend
<lb/><persName>Paul</persName> back again after his visit to the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and the etceteras he brought were as welcome as he
<lb/>We had <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> a most gloomy view of the state
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> from <persName>Motseabona</persName> felt quite sad
<lb/>over it. Everybody <supplied cert="high">was</supplied> talking of leaving &amp; many actually
<lb/>left. You too among the talkers of learning. we
<lb/>really did not know what to make of it. I was
<lb/>on the point of offering you this house
<lb/>in order that you might go on undisturbed in 
<lb/>your translations. Anxiety to see some little
<lb/>fruit from our labours among the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/>was the only thing in my mind that <w>pre<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-vented</w>. And after all, the mountain in labour
<lb/>brought forth a ridiculous mouse. <persName>Paul</persName> gave
<lb/>such a gloomy account of the numbers 
<lb/>&amp; state of your young people we felt
<lb/>quite cheered. Above all to see <persName><unclear cert="medium">Sebube</unclear></persName> come
<lb/>forward &amp; choose a station for himself is 
<lb/>quite exhilarating. I felt inclined at once
<lb/>to go over &amp; help him with his house
<lb/>but thought afterwards it would be better not
<lb/>Let all the praise of the commencement be given

<lb/>to whom it is due &amp; all the disgrace of attempting 
<lb/>to hinder his settlement <hi rend="sup">rest</hi> on the head which could tell
<lb/>you with tears &amp; groans that he <hi rend="underline">always</hi> assisted native
<lb/>teachers. <persName>Sebube</persName> will tell you of his message to
<lb/>the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="medium">Wooketse</unclear></term> not to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> him. fortunately his
<lb/>influence is there as almost everywhere else 
<lb/>somewhere about the degree zero.</p>
<lb/><p>We delayed the Baptism of <persName>Sechele</persName> for two
<lb/>months after his formal application. As
<lb/>he had for a long time previous professed
<lb/>firm belief in the truth of Christianity &amp; his
<lb/>general conduct seemed to be influenced by
<lb/>this <choice><sic>beliefe</sic><corr>belief</corr></choice> we did not feel so much hesitancy
<lb/>as we should have done had there been mo<del type="strikethrough">re</del>
<lb/>previous indications of change. He was
<lb/>tested in the interval by his own people
<lb/>in several ways &amp; by the renowned chief 
<lb/><persName>Moshesh</persName> in a way that might have influenced
<lb/>one who was insincere at heart. He had sent
<lb/>some men with Karosses about four or
<lb/>five months previously in order to purchase a
<lb/>horse. <persName>Moshesh</persName><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the messengers very
<lb/>kindly and as I gave them a note to the
<lb/>missionaries requesting any members who
<lb/>might feel disposed, to act kindly towards them
<lb/>&amp; for their spiritual good the poor fellows

	

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000659_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>were well taken care of. <persName>Moshesh</persName> gave them about
<lb/>ten head of &amp; cattle &amp; two horses. A great deal for
<lb/>poor people in this country &amp; sent a private
<lb/>message to the chief that whatever he wished whether
<lb/>guns gunpowder horses or cattle he must apply to
<lb/>him &amp; he would supply them, &amp; tell him to allow
<lb/>his people to believe if they like but he (<persName>Sechele</persName>) must
<lb/>never believe. I am a king said <persName>Moshesh</persName> "I <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice>
<lb/>put myself under the authority of another (<choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> God)
<lb/>I have my kingdom as well as He. &amp; people would
<lb/>laugh at me if I believed &amp; put myself under the
<lb/>power of another. tell <persName>Sechele</persName> that." <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>told me although it was a private message &amp; added
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="tn">ki le ka nyatsa gore ga a itse se o se <unclear cert="medium">buan</unclear>
<lb/>ka a re <persName>Morimo</persName> ki khose ka ana</foreign>. I should
<lb/>not like this private message to get wind. The
<lb/>answer seemed satisfactory to us. We were
<lb/>happy to have <persName>Paul</persName> with us In <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> him
<lb/>many of the people were shedding tears of sorrow
<lb/>for what do you think? That he was so
<lb/>far left to himself as <del type="strikethrough">to allow himself</del> to drink
<lb/>the brains of men. It seemed water, said one
<lb/>to me. I expected to see something <foreign xml:lang="tn">tala</foreign> in it
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="tn">Ka na ba rosa yalo</foreign> send another <foreign xml:lang="tn">na <unclear cert="low">reñ</unclear></foreign>? They
<lb/>in general believe the satanic suggestions of wicked
<lb/>persons who tell them that baptism is being
<lb/>caused to drink men's brains &amp; the Lord's supper
<lb/>a scene of impurity. They love darkness rather

<lb/>among the <placeName><region>Interior0</region></placeName> chiefs who will embrace the gospel
<lb/>He endures a good deal of trial from his people
<lb/>at present. We have no rain - one good shower
<lb/>alone this year while around us the rains
<lb/>have been abundant. The <placeName><geogName type="river">Kolobeñ</geogName></placeName> gets smaller

<lb/>for the last three weeks. The people say
<lb/>to him, "There is <persName>Mosielele</persName>, he has plenty of rain
<lb/>&amp; he hates the word. Our chief loves it we have
<lb/>none" - This is the fourth year of scarcity. They
<lb/>had always abundance of corn <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> the Word
<lb/>came.- Last year at this time we could not
<lb/>make our water course contain its water
<lb/>but two dry seasons following each other seems
<lb/>too much for it- If the prince of the power
<lb/>of the air has no hand in it we feel unkindly
<lb/>towards the old rogue. We are cutting corn -
<lb/>seem to have a pretty fair crop. The friends
<lb/>who send the chairs would be pleased if they
<lb/>knew they came just two days before his
<lb/>baptism &amp; their first use was on that occasion
<lb/>&amp; one of them by the wife he has retained
<lb/>the gun gave great satisfaction, but two
<lb/>months nearly have elapsed before he could
<lb/>bring himself to fire with it. He told me he

<lb/>with it occasionally &amp; then put it into its bed.
<lb/>But a big buffalo made a mistake yesterday
<lb/>and came blundering through the town. He
<lb/>fired the first shot into it. It is now loaded
<lb/>in both barrels. He wonders who made the different

<lb/>the percussion are not at present so useful as

<lb/>have a portion tapering at the point which only

<lb/>operation it is either down to the bottom
<lb/>or broken Can you give me any hint or

<lb/><p>Can you provide us with <choice><orig>1/2</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> muid of good

<lb/>Yours come on splendidly. The scotch Kale was
<lb/>excellent at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName> but the two plants preserved
<lb/>for seed were planted close to each other &amp; a curious
<lb/>interchange was the result - The kale gave its breadth
<lb/>of leaf to the turnips &amp; contented itself with becoming
<lb/>a "thistle" with a short stalk The turnips are now
<lb/>things with leaves like bananas &amp; enormous
<lb/>branching inedible roots - A few seem to have
<lb/>escaped the contagion but I doubt whether
<lb/>they will be worth propagation</p>

<lb/>but a skin disease unusually fatal these

<lb/>it should be like rotten hay &amp; we say, so we do not
<lb/>dream of attaching blame to you because you
<lb/>are not the Tea dealer --- As for the <unclear cert="medium">Ham</unclear>
<lb/>We never doubted your kind intentions in
<lb/>sending it - &amp; our remarks had a reference to
<lb/>the future rather than the past - We never
<lb/>dreamed of sending back anything bought for us
<lb/>never having once looked on you as the dealers</p>
<lb/><p>We are not Mahometans either. We are glad

<lb/>I am very glad of the musket. Have you never <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>the powder ordered? You must not forget that one
<lb/>of the <unclear cert="medium">bellows</unclear> must come this way. I intend

<lb/>approbations - as soon as we plough we shall

<lb/>that <persName>Sebube</persName> &amp; <persName>Paul</persName> join at the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="low">Beiñuaketse</unclear></term> at first
<lb/>But on reflection came <add place="above">to</add><add place="below">^</add> the conclusion that

<lb/>as <persName>Sebube</persName> has been - each may in time be
<lb/>furnished with an associate. <persName>Sebube</persName> does 
<lb/>not seem to need any energy from <persName>Paul</persName> &amp;
<lb/>I do not expect soon to find one better adapted
<lb/>for commencing a station than <persName>Paul</persName>
<lb/>If <persName>Paul</persName> is not allowed to remain in the

<lb/>the attempt would have been made sooner had we

<lb/>caused more than 12 months delay. a long time to some

<lb/><p>Many thanks for the gun aparatus. Have

<lb/>to pay for the double barrel &amp; gun &amp; will do so soon for
