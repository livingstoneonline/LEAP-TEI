<lb/><!-- The number 3 (circled) appears here. It does not appear to be in Livingstone's hand AM --><p rend="right"><placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa </settlement></placeName> <date when="1845-05-12">12 May 1845</date></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p rend="center">We <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> your very welcome letter by
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> who went out with <persName>Mosi</persName> &amp; felt very thankful
<lb/>for it for we were very anxious to hear what you
<lb/>thought after perusing my long epistle on the <choice><sic>disagreable</sic><corr>disagreeable</corr></choice>
<lb/>subject. We hope to have an opportunity soon
<lb/>so I begin to answer what is answerable &amp; let you
<lb/>know how we get on. Your question about the
<lb/>Boerish peace makers is easily settled. The <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>
<lb/>is not yet pacified. <persName>Bube</persName> intends it is currently
<lb/>reported, to remove to a spot not very distant from
<lb/>this. He sent me word that he intends coming
<lb/>for the purpose <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">of</add> asking land next week, &amp; the reason
<lb/>is, he fears the <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> will come out during this
<lb/>winter. <persName>Sekhomi</persName> has stolen some sheep from
<lb/><persName>Mosilikatse</persName> this year &amp; he killed 23 of his people
<lb/>last year when they came to ask tribute. All
<lb/>are now dreading <persName>Mosilikatse</persName>'s resentment. <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>told me he would remove instantly to a <placeName><geogName type="feature">fountain
<lb/>called Kolobeñ</geogName></placeName> in hopes of getting a missionary
<lb/>if it were not for that same fear - And
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">last</del> two years ago when the <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> attacked in
<lb/>succession the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>, <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> &amp; 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Wanketaze</term> of <persName>Sebegoe</persName>. the <choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice> heard the news
<lb/><hi rend="underline">and fled</hi>. They would do so again this year
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> went with large presents of ivory
<lb/>to <persName>Hendrick Potkeiter</persName> the commandant of the
<lb/>Boers to entreat their assistance for the recovery
<lb/>of his cattle. Instead of <hi rend="underline">pacifying</hi> the poor
<lb/>fellow as he wished they told <persName>Mr Bain</persName> that the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Caffres</term> had come with tribute to them. Catch
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> going back again with his ivory
<lb/>while <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hume</persName> lives. Not a single fray
<lb/>has been prevented by the Boers &amp; the notion</p>
	<ab>
<lb/><persName>Mary</persName> has been <term type="ailment">ill</term> but a small <term type="bodyprocess">bleeding</term> has relieved the most troublesome symptoms &amp; she now does
<lb/>well. My <term type="bodypart">arm</term> is very much stronger but the splint is still in the same state
    </ab>


	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000583_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>that they drove away <persName>Mosilikatse</persName> I believe now to be
<lb/>very questionable. the <term type="tribe">Goolahs</term> were the cause
<lb/>of his flight &amp; not the paltry attack of <persName>Mosega</persName>
<lb/>Ask the people of <persName>Sechele</persName> how they like the
<lb/>Boers &amp; they will tell you that rather than come
<lb/>near them again they will desert their chief</p>
<lb/><p>I began a meeting for the purpose of trying
<lb/>to interest the people in our meetings in general
<lb/>&amp; have continued talking on different subjects
<lb/>calculated to engage their attention But have not
<lb/>met the success I expected. Our own people
<lb/><del type="strikethrough" hand="#U">are the chief attendants and they seem to enjoy
<lb/>what is told them. The <term type="bodypart">hearts</term> of the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>
<lb/>must be changed before anything can be made
<lb/>of them, that is the first thing I see, and I
<lb/>shall attend to it as the everything. My mind
<lb/>has been taken up with the affair of <persName>Edwards</persName>
<lb/>to an extent far exceeding my wishes. I think
<lb/>of it when I ought to be meditating on better
<lb/>things But I hope I may not indulge in
<lb/>any improper spirit towards him. I have
<lb/>felt less anxious than I expected I should be
<lb/>when told I should have a committee held over me
<lb/>By the way, I may ask, if he will be allowed to
<lb/>speak or contradict without my presence, I
<lb/><choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> as I speak by writing he ought although
<lb/>there to do the same &amp; then let the <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> judge
<lb/>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what he will say after, he could
<lb/>speak about my shabby treatment when he
<lb/>offered <hi rend="underline">to build the house</hi>, &amp; no such offer was
<lb/>ever made</del></p>
<lb/><p><del type="strikethrough" hand="#U">Another affair I wish to mention to you as I
<lb/>feel rather at a loss how to act in it, if I were not
<lb/>already involved with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> I should see my path clear</del>


	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000583_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>But as it is I fear I may act more from an improper
<lb/>spirit than f<gap extent="2" unit="chars" agent="blotting"/><supplied cert="high">ro</supplied>m a wish to prevent the degradation of the
<lb/>missionary character. Some time last year <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> told
<lb/>me that having been at <persName>Bube</persName>'s a brother of the latter offered
<lb/>him a large tusk for a musket he had with him, But he (<persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>)
<lb/>had declined, the same man came here a short time before
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>. left for <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> &amp; came to me &amp; asked if I should
<lb/>give him a cow for a large tusk. I replied, no, I am not a
<lb/>trader. He said yes I know you are not a trader but <persName>Edwards</persName>
<lb/>helped me with a gun &amp; I helped him with a tusk. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>.
<lb/>was that day down on a visit to the <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> &amp; having come
<lb/>home in the evening the man left on the day following and
<lb/>I neither asked nor heard any more about it <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> the
<lb/>return of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Milligan</persName> from <persName>Bube</persName>'s. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>'s man went
<lb/>with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Milligan</expan></choice></persName> to <persName>Bube</persName>'s to purchase Karosses, for <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> (I suppose
<lb/>for carpets) and <persName>Mr <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Milligan</expan></choice></persName> said to me, "O <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> has turned
<lb/>trader now". "His man brought a fine large tusk <add place="below">^</add><add place="above"><hi rend="underline">this is <choice><abbr>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi></abbr><expan>Number</expan></choice> 2</hi></add> from the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> for him". If it were not for our difference
<lb/>I should ask an explanation from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> and caution
<lb/>him against appearing to degrade the missionary character.
<lb/>He has been purchasing oxen ever since we came here
<lb/>but he always mentioned his journey to the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> as
<lb/>the reason, and of course that journey does require many.</p>
<lb/><p>I shall not feel surprised although I hear that
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> has made overtures to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ashton</persName> to supplant me
<lb/>here. Many things have recently come back to my
<lb/>recollection which had entirely escaped me, and why
<lb/>they should have vanished from my mind I cannot
<lb/><choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice>. But now when I put them together I see
<lb/>the reason of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> running to a committee, He
<lb/>wishes to have me out of this altogether &amp; he thinks
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ashton</persName> a more likely subject for him to twist
<lb/>round his <term type="bodypart">finger</term>. When <del type="cancelled">I returned from</del><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Moffat</persName>
<lb/>wrote from <placeName><settlement type="town">Bethelsdorp</settlement></placeName> she o<del type="strikethrough">m</del>mitted mentioning anything
<lb/>about the young <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice>. When I returned, to the
<lb/>house this was the first piece of news I got, and
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> having conjectured that there must be some
<lb/>difference among them. "A very good thing indeed
<lb/>remarked <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> if there is <persName>Moffat</persName> will not have it all
<lb/><space dim="horizontal" extent="8" unit="words"/>his own way"

       

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000583_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>and again on a subsequent occasion, I think after your
<lb/>arrival but I am not sure. Perhaps after my return from
<lb/>meeting you "I think <persName>Ashton</persName> is a man of <choice><sic>independant</sic><corr>independent</corr></choice> mind &amp;
<lb/><choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be led by the nose by <persName>Moffat</persName>" and then when
<lb/>I returned from seeing <persName>Mary</persName>, I was asked if I should not
<lb/>like to live with my father in law. I thought the question
<lb/>very impudent &amp; simply said "No" &amp; then among a
<lb/>number of fishing pumping questions put to <persName>Mary</persName>
<lb/>such as "You &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ashton</persName> must be very intimate, &amp; if
<lb/><persName>Ashton</persName> was to remain at the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>, these things had
<lb/>all vanished from my mind, But in thinking over the
<lb/>other affair a connecting link I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> from one
<lb/>of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>'s intimate friends. came back with great
<lb/>vividness, "I advise you said he to be as little <choice><sic>dependant</sic><corr>dependent</corr></choice>
<lb/>on <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> as possible, we have all been too much so"
<lb/>Now I may be wrong but my close connection with    
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> seems to have had some influence
<lb/>as well as my "dishonest dishonourable unchristian
<lb/>&amp; shabby conduct".</p>
<lb/><p>The plough is in process of resuscitation and though
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> consigned it to "old iron" I feel sanguine it
<lb/>will soon be of more use than that material. Not
<lb/>having the instruments for boring or drilling holes for
<lb/>rivets I have taken the essential portions &amp; let them
<lb/>into a log of <foreign xml:lang="und">murutu</foreign> of this shape <!-- drawing of shape appears here AM --> the
<lb/>different portions are firmly screwed to it &amp; tomorrow
<lb/>we shall put in a new beam of white ash much
<lb/>thicker than the old but with the old wheel &amp; coulter
<lb/>irons. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Milligan</persName> gave me an idea of the shape
<lb/>or I should have gone wrong, altogether. I had the
<lb/>handles in when he came &amp; as I was doing it simply
<lb/>from my recollection of the shape of a plough I have
<lb/>the centre of the handles right in the centre of the
<lb/>plough &amp; not chiefly on the furrow side as it ought
<lb/>to be. Will you send the iron which runs from
<lb/>the handles to the beam, which you shewed me in
<lb/>the printing office. the one you made is entirely
<lb/>gone.</p>


	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000583_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>We have been favoured with <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Greig</persName>'s presence more
<lb/>than <choice><sic>agreable</sic><corr>agreeable</corr></choice>. We escaped from him only once &amp; that
<lb/>was by getting all ready &amp; starting for <persName>Sechele</persName>'s as soon
<lb/>as he made his appearance from the other side. He was
<lb/>nearly quits with us for he said he would come to meet us
<lb/>We went round by another way But our gent. very soon
<lb/>came back to see if we had not arrived. I thought of
<lb/>going off to <persName>Bube</persName> but he is determined to accompany us
<lb/>So I give up that &amp; now think of going Eastward to
<lb/>the son of <persName>Sebeque</persName>. I could easily be plain with him
<lb/>&amp; get quit of his very insipid company but for one
<lb/>consideration Before we had been many days here
<lb/>he made some remarks which made me believe <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>had been reciting to him the burden of his song, for
<lb/>instance, "<persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> is a man of a very peculiar
<lb/>temper" "very difficult to get on with I should think"
<lb/>"He tells me he did the most of the work of the church
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement>Kuruman</settlement></placeName>" "at least all the woodwork" To these
<lb/>remarks I only replied that as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hamiltom</persName> &amp; <persName>Moffat</persName>
<lb/>were there it is not very likely they would be idle
<lb/>&amp; avoided saying a word about <persName>Edwards</persName>. But believing
<lb/>that <persName>Edwards</persName> had given as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> would say "the
<lb/>other side of my character" I rather submit to be
<lb/>half eaten up by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>G.</abbr><expan>Greig</expan></choice></persName> than that he should have
<lb/>any thing to say against us. If we could by any
<lb/>possibility get a secondhand mill <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> our own comes
<lb/>we should get on well whoever comes <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice> us
<lb/>We have maize &amp; the large box which contained the
<lb/>drawers nearly full of wheat. We are inundated with
<lb/>pumpkins. I got two sheep for gun mending, thanks
<lb/>to you, and two karrosses (debt) which I shall send
<lb/>as soon as I get as payment for the steel. The people
<lb/>believe that having married your daughter I must know
<lb/>as much about the business as yourself. the goodness
<lb/>of the steel confirms their opinion When putting
<lb/>on a plate for <persName>Sechele</persName> last week I soldered it very
<lb/>well with powdered glass instead of the <unclear cert="medium">borax</unclear> you use
<lb/>But on hardening again the libi were not warm
<lb/>enough so I took it to the bellows &amp; the copper
<lb/>came all out again. I tried it again with

       

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000583_0006"><!--pb/@n='3v'--></pb>
<lb/>other copper no fewer than four times &amp; it always
<lb/>ran any where but where I wanted it. In despair
<lb/>I put in some white lead. What must I do if
<lb/>I make the same mistake again? the old files
<lb/>you gave me I case hardened &amp; find they supply the
<lb/>place of the fine large coarse teethed one you gave
<lb/>&amp; which I got spoiled by lending to <persName>Paulus</persName>. If you
<lb/>have any others from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hamilton</persName>'s burned house
<lb/>which you <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> care about I shall feel thankful
<lb/>for one or two either to harden or make taps
<lb/>of. My small plate has been spoiled by <w>some<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>one</w>. the thread is nearly gone, I have made taps
<lb/>of those holes which will make them and
<lb/>will take the liberty of sending out two of the
<lb/>smaller ones for the screw from your plate
<lb/>and then I shall try &amp; finish a plate which
<lb/>I have already forge<unclear cert="medium">d</unclear>. The small screws I
<lb/>need are those inside a lock, particularly that
<lb/>which goes through the pan. I have got the
<lb/>chief &amp; a few of his principal men to try
<lb/>their hands at the anvil and this although
<lb/>they believed they should die if they did. One of
<lb/>the hereditary smiths came and taught us
<lb/>how to make native axes. I did not know
<lb/>to fold in &amp; weld a thin bit before I saw him
<lb/>do it. I took one of the <choice><orig>antient</orig><reg>ancient</reg></choice> smiths
<lb/>with us to <persName>Sechele</persName>'s to shew me where his forefather
<lb/>found the <foreign xml:lang="und">tsipi</foreign> &amp; men. there are many mines
<lb/>and the smoke of the fires is still adhering to the
<lb/>roofs but they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> go in far. the veins reach
<lb/>the surface &amp; are about 2 inches in diameter only
<lb/>The man asserted while in the first recess <add place="below">or</add><add place="above">mine</add>that the
<lb/>rock above contained the ore. It is nearly identical
<lb/>with the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName><unclear cert="low">Trap</unclear>. I doubted but as he
<lb/>repeated his assertions with great confidence
<lb/>I thought perhaps it was the ore of tin. As
<lb/>I have nearly forgotten its appearance But when

       

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000583_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/>we came out I noticed a piece of the pretty green
<lb/>copper ore in a vein of about <choice><orig>½</orig><reg>1/2</reg></choice> an inch diameter
<lb/>&amp; pointed it out to him He said yes it is so after it is
<lb/>subjected to the fire. These were copper mines
<lb/>The tin I believe is found nearer to this place but in
<lb/>the same direction <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Evans</persName> found a piece of the ore
<lb/>much richer than any I have seen although I have
<lb/>been on the look out for it every time I have been
<lb/>in that country. The hill where I think it must
<lb/>lie in is called <placeName><geogName type="feature">Tsipcane</geogName></placeName> or as <unclear><term type="tribe">Batlapi</term></unclear> would say
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="feature">Tsicane</geogName></placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Sechele</persName> you will have heard lately put a man
<lb/>to death for witchcraft. We of course had a great
<lb/>deal of conversation on the subject &amp; on that of
<lb/>revenge. Before the former subject was introduced
<lb/>He asked me if an individual acted justly, fairly
<lb/>avoided fighting treated <unclear cert="high">b</unclear>oth his own people and
<lb/><gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">s</supplied>trangers kindly, killed witches &amp; prayed to God
<lb/>would he <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">be</add> saved - this question made me see
<lb/>he thought he had committed a meritorious action
<lb/>in killing the man. The above affair became
<lb/>mixed up with another which you will perhaps
<lb/><gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="hole"/><supplied cert="high">a</supplied>lso hear about. One of his people who formerly
<lb/>killed an uncle of <persName>Sechele</persName> fled on hearing that
<lb/>the witch had been killed &amp; came here, being afraid
<lb/>that he might be the next. When he arrived here
<lb/>he told the people that <persName>Sechele</persName> wished to kill him on
<lb/>account of his cattle &amp;c. The man's father brought
<lb/>all his son's sheep &amp;c. to <persName>Sechele</persName> after the latter had
<lb/>fled &amp; divided them among the principal people. <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>took one only &amp; <choice><orig>eat</orig><reg>ate</reg></choice> it &amp; told the others not to slaughter
<lb/>any of them <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> he had tried to recover the man
<lb/>the man was sent for &amp; returned and is now
<lb/>alive &amp; well. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> believing the man's
<lb/>testimony against <persName>Sechele</persName> sends him "a severe
<lb/>reprimand" as he expressed it to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Greig</persName> for a
<lb/>deed which he did not do. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> does not
<lb/>like <persName>Sechele</persName> because <persName>Sechele</persName> is rather friendly with me

       

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000583_0008"><!--pb/@n='4v'--></pb>
<lb/>when leaving in order to visit <persName>Sechele</persName> last time the chief
<lb/>here said to me, "Yes you can go to visit <persName>Sechele</persName>, you
