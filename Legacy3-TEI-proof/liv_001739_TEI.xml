<lb/>the statements respecting the treatment endured
<lb/>by the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> missionaries are perfectly
<lb/>astounding, yet, though far from supposing
<lb/>myself to be proof against misrepresentation
<lb/>I cannot <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> how I could have been
<lb/>so grievously misled as you imagine. If
<lb/>you allow me to state a few particulars
<lb/>connected with our visit I may possibly
<lb/>appear not altogether unreasonable in
<lb/>withholding my assent to the statements so
<lb/>generally <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>, even should the opinion
<lb/>that the mission ought to be abandoned not
<lb/>be modified.</p>
<lb/><p><unclear cert="medium"><persName>Sekeletu</persName></unclear>was labouring under a <term type="ailment">skin

<lb/>been inflicted by <choice><sic>witch craft</sic><corr>witchcraft</corr></choice> for which some
<lb/>influential headmen had been executed, but
<lb/>he treated us with exactly the same <choice><sic>cordialty</sic><corr>cordiality</corr></choice>
<lb/>as he did in former years when I was alone
<lb/>He was by no means popular, and was believed
<lb/>by many to be more deformed by the disease
<lb/>than we found him to be. Some had talked
<lb/>openly of deposing him. which was equivalent
<lb/>to killing him. but from both well and <w>ill-

<lb/>that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><supplied>Helmore</supplied></persName> and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> Helmore</persName> had been highly valued
<lb/>by <del type="cancelled">both</del> chief and people. The subject tribes
<lb/>are by no means so tongue-tied there as they
<lb/>are under <persName><unclear cert="medium">Mosilikatze,</unclear></persName> yet not at <placeName><settlement type="town"><unclear cert="high">Sesheke</unclear></settlement></placeName> and
<lb/><placeName><region><unclear cert="high">Linyanti</unclear></region></placeName> alone did they speak well of our
<lb/>departed friend but on the East coast
<lb/>utterance was given occasionally to expressions
<lb/>respecting <persName>Helmore</persName> which were particularly
<lb/>gratifying. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> who alone of our

<lb/>the son of a man who escaped execution in

<lb/>had certainly no great love for <unclear cert="medium"><persName>Sekeletu</persName></unclear>. Yet
<lb/>he spoke of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Helmore</persName><choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice>supplies of
<lb/>meat whenever he asked. and when nearly
<lb/>insensible the chief asked him if he wished
<lb/>meat and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><choice><abbr>H</abbr><expan>Helmore</expan></choice></persName> shook his head &amp; smiled. The
<lb/>difference of social position to which you
<lb/>refer was not viewed by the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> as
<lb/>the missionaries may have looked upon it-</p>

<lb/>very heartily for your kind wishes and letter and also for the Report
<lb/><supplied cert="high">I</supplied> beg you not to think that I in the least condescended that <add place="above"><persName>Price</persName></add><supplied cert="high">is</supplied> unfit for his office- greater
<lb/>experience will no doubt enable him to get on better- Ever affectionately Yours 
<lb/><persName>David Livingstone</persName></ab>


	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001739_0003"><!--pb/@n='3'--></pb>
<lb/><p>for in speaking kindly of <persName>Helmore</persName>, they often
<lb/>remarked "he was just like you a man with
<lb/>a heart" i-e. a kind man.</p>
<lb/><p>It was also very painfully apparent that no
<lb/>feelings of respect were entertained towards
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Price</persName>. I have refrained from saying a
<lb/>word to anyone on this point but yourself.
<lb/>Thus, while <persName>Helmore</persName> was represented as <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice>
<lb/>supplies of meat "<persName>Price</persName> might ask long enough
<lb/>before he got any." And <persName>Helmore</persName> was said to
<lb/>have declared after the death of his wife "that
<lb/><persName>Price</persName> being a child might return, but he (<choice><abbr>H.</abbr><expan>Helmore</expan></choice>)
<lb/>never would go back, but proceed onward
<lb/>as soon as I came whether his elders had
<lb/>sent him." The question was put repeatedly
<lb/>Why was <persName>Helmore</persName> not taken to the <placeName><region>Highlands</region></placeName>-
<lb/>and the answer was just what I gave you-
<lb/>It is notorious that only two influential men
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">in the tribe</del> object to the whole tribe removing
<lb/>thither and the general belief was that had
<lb/>he lived a little longer <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><choice><abbr>H.</abbr><expan>Helmore</expan></choice></persName> would have led
<lb/>them to the South East. We never heard a syllable
<lb/>to his disadvantage but we overheard one man
<lb/>tell another <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">who had come from <placeName><settlement>Lette</settlement></placeName></add> that having gone to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Price</expan></choice></persName>'s <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>
<lb/>while the latter was at a meal he was kicked
<lb/>away, and he added "Had <persName><unclear cert="high">Sekeletu</unclear></persName> not been
<lb/>there by -- I would have fought with him."
<lb/>Some remarks made at a public meeting
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName><add place="below">^</add><add place="above">about binding a man to his <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> wheel &amp;c</add> and fortunately unreported
<lb/>in the papers - and a statement about using
<lb/>his revolver with the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> made at the
<lb/>Royal Observatory before going into the country
<lb/>at all lead me to make some abatement
    <!-- Perpendicular text in lefthand margin is duplicate of lines on previous page HB 6-20-13 -->


	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001739_0004"><!--pb/@n='4'--></pb>
<lb/>as to the colouring without questioning <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Price</expan></choice></persName>'s
<lb/>veracity. It was abundantly evident that he
<lb/>had failed to secure the respect of either chief
<lb/>or people. This is no justification of any
<lb/>wrong the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> may have committed,
<lb/>but it is remarkable, if they <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> no
<lb/>provocation, that they should shew so
<lb/>much rapacity towards <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Price</persName>, and leave
<lb/>my goods safely in my <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> &amp; in their
<lb/>huts though the boxes are unlocked.</p>
<lb/><p>As to the further prosecution of this mission
<lb/>I am very glad to see in your Report since
<lb/>I began this letter that you still look hopefully
<lb/>forward. I grieve over the loss this
<lb/>country has sustained in the departure of
<lb/>our brother to his rest. Fine <term type="nationality">Englishmen</term>
<lb/>have died in that country since the discovery
<lb/>of<placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake <unclear cert="medium">Agami</unclear></geogName></placeName>. One perished by trying to save
<lb/>a duck in the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zouga</geogName></placeName>. Another, with his servant,
<lb/>was lost under suspicion of foul play - Another
<lb/>ran madly under the feet of an elephant -
<lb/>and others blew themselves up with gunpowder
<lb/>the tenth, with his wife, he's at <placeName><region><unclear cert="high">Linyanti</unclear></region></placeName> &amp;
<lb/>of the whole he alone had an object worth
<lb/>risking his life for. There, without a tree
<lb/>within a hundred yards to mark the spot, he
<lb/>rests from his labours, as good and as
<lb/>devoted a missionary as ever left <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>.
<lb/>I collected a few bones &amp; placed <choice><sic>him</sic><corr>them</corr></choice> over his
<lb/>head - there is not a stone in the country - but
<lb/>these will soon vanish and his memory
<lb/>will remain only in men's hearts - I still
<lb/>feel convinced that a flourishing mission might
<lb/>be established <del type="cancelled">there</del> by a judicious missionary</p>
	<ab rend="vertical"><!-- Is this the way to code the ab now? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>I was only one day there &amp; went over from <placeName><settlement type="town"><unclear cert="high">Sesheke</unclear></settlement></placeName> only for my medicine box</ab>


	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001739_0005"><!--pb/@n='5'--></pb>
<lb/><p>P.S. It has occurred to me to add that the
<lb/>treatment we <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> was not the effect
<lb/>of presents as each of the men from
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Lette</settlement></placeName> had a load of his own and they
<lb/>would not carry much for us or their
<lb/>chief. We abstained from complaining
<lb/>of this as it would have caused
<lb/>the confiscation of all their hard
<lb/>earned property. We gave <persName>Sekeletu</persName>
<lb/>comparatively little &amp; may have appeared
<lb/>stingy.</p>
<lb/><p>The want of horses was <choice><sic>severly</sic><corr>severely</corr></choice>
<lb/>felt by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Helmore</persName>. It is not
<lb/>likely that I should have recommended
<lb/>them to one who knew the country
<lb/>so well but he was seen at one
<lb/>of the watering places in the Desert
