<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p rend="left">Herein you will <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> receive the fulmination
<lb/>of the <persName>Commandant <choice><sic>Potgeiter</sic><corr>Potgieter</corr></choice></persName> who I believe has gone to
<lb/>a tribunal at which nothing but truth will be told
<lb/>It is a copy sent from the committee by the then secretary
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ashton</persName>. The answer which they sent me at
<lb/>the same time is I find not by me but it must   
<lb/>be at <placeName><geogName type="monument">Kolobeng</geogName></placeName> and as soon as I can lay hands
<lb/>upon it I shall forward it<space dim="horizontal" extent="2" unit="words"/>A <add place="above">re</add> - perusal of the
<lb/>document brought some circumstances to my 
<lb/>mind which had nearly vanished from my 
<lb/>memory. One was that when the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> heard
<lb/>of the intentions of the Boers to molest me they
<lb/>instantly called a <unclear cert="low">Peecho</unclear> and resolved unanimously
<lb/>to defend their missionary with their blood. On
<lb/>my objecting to their exposing their lives on my 
<lb/>account they replied it was on their own
<lb/>account for whatever was done to me was
<lb/>done to them. They intended to mislead the 
<lb/>Boers into a strong ambuscade if they found
<lb/>out by any means that they were approaching 
<lb/>and a simultaneous attack was to follow by 
<lb/>both guns &amp; <foreign xml:lang="und">assegais</foreign>. If they should come upon
<lb/>us at unawares the whole tribe was to rush

      

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000761_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>to our house and defend us with their lives. Had <persName><choice><sic>Potgeiter</sic><corr>Potgieter</corr></choice></persName>
<lb/>come he would have met a very different reception
<lb/>from any he ever had before. The tribes he has attacked
<lb/>never could do him or his party on horseback any
<lb/>harm. His fighting has been a series of cold blooded
<lb/>murders. In his bloodthirstiness he has poured out
<lb/>drunk offerings to the Devil. What a terrible surprise 
<lb/>such men must look upon their prowess in the
<lb/>still shades of Hades. No false pretences there
<lb/>of "making peace among the natives" and no
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="nl">Fredikants</foreign> to baptize them into the belief that
<lb/>they are christians and no mistake and then 
<lb/>land them in the "Land African". I am 
<lb/>however preaching to you instead of writing
<lb/>a letter. Well when I saw the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/>were determined to doctor the Boers I thought
<lb/>it right to send my family out of the way
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi><choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName> was in child-bed but much preferred
<lb/>going <unclear cert="medium">westward</unclear> with the <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> women
<lb/>to going to <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. The <term type="tribe">Kurumanites</term><!-- not sure if this should be tagged as a tribe, or treated like "Englishmen" AJS -->
<lb/>pressed upon us the propriety of sending the
<lb/>family out there - and I did so about four
<lb/>months after the threats of the Boers had
<lb/>vanished into thin air. a short time after
<lb/>they left for <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> I departed for the
<lb/>Lake - the first time - I remember too that

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000761_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>the imputation of having run away nettled me more
<lb/>than all the rest. I wrote on the paper in pencil the 
<lb/>words you see &amp; left the letter in a conspicuous 
<lb/>situation at <placeName><geogName type="monument">Kolobeng</geogName></placeName> in case they should come
<lb/>when I was absent at the Lake. I destroyed abou<gap reason="cutoff" unit="chars" extent="1"/><supplied cert="high">t</supplied>
<lb/><unclear cert="low">350</unclear> letters before going - and many of these I regret
<lb/>but felt unwilling anything should fall into their
<lb/>hands of which they could make any bad use</p>
<lb/><p>I am here in the house of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Alheit</persName> of
<lb/><unclear cert="low">Skeit</unclear> Fontein and may inform you how <!-- This is labeled as "Scheit" Fontein on Livingstone Online, but this definitely looks like a "k"...how properly spelled? HB 6-21-13 -->
<lb/>we have succeded hitherto. We have come
<lb/>but slowly. My <unclear cert="high">oxen</unclear> were lean but quite
<lb/>fresh. I used them only and by buying some 
<lb/>and <choice><sic>exhanging</sic><corr>exchanging</corr></choice> others as they became tired
<lb/>for fresh ones giving about 10/ on each for
<lb/>the extra flesh of the new ones I succeeded 
<lb/>pretty well. I shall soon be at the River and
<lb/>thence will get on well. The oxen I have now
<lb/>are in good condition &amp; will carry me thither
<lb/>quickly.. The <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> however is enormously
<lb/>heavy - This <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">loading</add> is one of those things I shall do
<lb/>but once in my life. We had to pass through
<lb/>a bad defile - and hired a span from a 
<lb/>Boer to take us through. He took us into
<lb/>it but his large fat oxen could not move
<lb/>it farther. I inspanned our meagre beasts and
      
      

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000761_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>they walked out with it at once. The Boer then left
<lb/>us in disgust and when we had got fairly through
<lb/>wanted payment but this I declined.. I shall feel
<lb/>glad when I deliver the articles to their owners
<lb/>The wood work of the wheels cracks from the
<lb/>enormous strain There now take a lesson
<lb/>by my folly. Of <persName>George</persName> I have seen nothing
<lb/>though I have travelled so slowly. I gave him two
<lb/>men so as they do not make their appearance
<lb/>he must be on his way after us either by 
<lb/>the road we hence come or by some other
<lb/>we shall be sure to meet at <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>I have been quite busy all the way with the
<lb/>Dictionary I did not know I had so 
<lb/>many words in my head as I have put
<lb/>down but every time I sit down there is
<lb/>no end to them. They are hooked together
<lb/>by strange associations. I have not begun any
<lb/>thing else. The <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> is most inconvenient
<lb/>for writing. I can write only on my side 
<lb/>and must <unclear cert="low">doff</unclear> &amp; trek on my "inexpressibles"
<lb/>only when lying flat on my back. I must
<lb/>be getting old &amp; illnatured now for the constrained 
<lb/>positions of my <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> life rather makes me 
<lb/>crusty than gentle. The longer one lives the 
<lb/>more one learns, is however true</p>

<lb/><p>I have been reading the tour of the <persName>Bishop</persName>. He is quite
<lb/>an angel compared to me. <choice><sic>Dont</sic><corr>Don't</corr></choice> you see the
<lb/>effects of the <unclear cert="low">Puseyite</unclear><unclear cert="medium">pentral</unclear> belief in salvation
<lb/>by works. He is quite in earnest, no doubt of it
<lb/>he and the <persName>Archdeacon</persName> tramping it on foot
<lb/>Well done my hearties. If I had £800 or even
<lb/>£400 a year travelling expenses as you my Lord
<lb/>and your venerableness the <persName>Archdeacon</persName> have I
<lb/>would not be so <choice><sic>self denying</sic><corr>self-denying</corr></choice>. <unclear cert="medium">No</unclear> not I. I would

<lb/>in my cart and should now be somewhere
<lb/>beyond your <persName><choice><sic>Lorship</sic><corr>Lordship</corr></choice></persName>'s diocese. Perhaps sitting
<lb/>at supper with the <persName>bishop of <placeName><settlement type="town">Kuruman</settlement></placeName></persName> aye
<lb/>with the Apostle of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>.</p><!-- Should Apostle of Bechaunas be termed as a persName? HB 7-1-13 -->
<lb/><p>You will have observed a great deal of ignorance
<lb/>apparent in his <persName><choice><sic>Lorship</sic><corr>Lordship</corr></choice></persName>'s notes and a great
<lb/>deal understood or rather presumed in the 
<lb/>readers for whom it is intended- see the
<lb/>Preface. You are expected to believe that
<lb/>he passed through unknown regions and
<lb/>even where he seems to have been without
<lb/>a path you find him looking for <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Harding</persName>'s 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">spoor</unclear>. And mention is made of <persName>Captain
<lb/>Gardner</persName> but none of a body of troops which

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000761_0006"><!--pb/@n='3v'--></pb>
<lb/>The earnestness with which he works is however
<lb/>very pleasant and almost excuses the ignorance
<lb/>The sour looks at the <choice><sic>Independants</sic><corr>Independents</corr></choice>, the grinning <!-- Should "Independents" be termed somehow as a political party, or left uncoded? HB 7-1-13 -->
<lb/>with <unclear cert="medium">watering</unclear> teeth at the Dutch Fredikant's salaries <!-- How should Dutch Fredkant's be coded here? HB 7-1-13-->

<lb/>over two poor simpletons daughters of a <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>missionary.. He feels not all the while that he
<lb/>makes the least part of his book by imitating
<lb/>the <choice><sic>Independants</sic><corr>Independents</corr></choice> way of doing things. And as for
<lb/>the missionary's daughter's, bless his heart we <!-- Is the apostrophe in daughter's unneeded here? HB 7-1-13 -->

<lb/><p>I have nothing to tell about the Boers
<lb/>or any one else. Have heard nothing about
<lb/>the <unclear cert="low">Caffie</unclear> war since I left nor of <persName>Botha</persName>
<lb/>The Boers are certainly the remnants of

<lb/>of nothing but Pounds, shillings, dollars
<lb/>guilders sheep &amp; oxen. Their whole 
<lb/>souls seem absorbed by this world's
<lb/>goods- Their talk is just exactly 
<lb/>what you overhear in the Jews

<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Alheit</persName> is a fine friendly man. He does not
