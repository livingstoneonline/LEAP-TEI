<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Waller</persName>
<lb/>I wrote you 
<lb/>last month but a 
<lb/>short note as I was 
<lb/>not very well and 
<lb/>soon hoped to be down 
<lb/>to you - I got a slight 
<lb/><term type="ailment">sunstroke</term> in coming 
<lb/>home and have had 
<lb/>a constant ringing 
<lb/>in the <term type="bodypart">Ears</term> &amp; <term type="ailment">deafness</term>
<lb/>ever since — It became 
<lb/>worse at times can 
<lb/>indisposes me for 

     

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001982_0002"><!--pb/@n='61v'--></pb>
<lb/>writing of which I have 
<lb/>a great deal to do. 
<lb/>In a note sent at the 
<lb/>same time to the bishop 
<lb/>in answer to an offer 
<lb/>to help from private 
<lb/>means in citing the 
<lb/>women &amp; children I 
<lb/>told him that I had doubts 
<lb/>about taking them to 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city"><choice><abbr>Johanna</abbr><expan>Johannesburg</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> though had 
<lb/>the boys been free 
<lb/>I would have sent all to 
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> — and some 
<lb/>would no doubt be 
<lb/>taken up by <persName>Bishop 
<lb/>Gray</persName>.  As it was 
<lb/>I though it might</p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001982_0003"><!--pb/@n='62r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>be best to arrange with 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Ferraõ</persName> for food for 
<lb/>a season but all this 
<lb/>was on the supposition 
<lb/>that the mission was  
<lb/>to continue.
<lb/>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> a letter by 
<lb/><persName>Blair</persName> in which the 
<lb/>Bishop says that 
<lb/>he had kept you 
<lb/>for nearly three months 
<lb/>according to a previous 
<lb/>arrangement and 
<lb/>now he will be glad 
<lb/>to hear that <del type="cancelled">"</del> I "am taking 
<lb/>steps to place <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Waller</persName>
<lb/>in an independent 
<lb/>position with respect 
<lb/>to the mission"

     

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001982_0004"><!--pb/@n='62v'--></pb>
<lb/>He says also that he 
<lb/>strongly disapproved of 
<lb/>your plans - and also 
<lb/>that he concludes from 
<lb/>an extant from one 
<lb/>of my letters <add place="above">to you</add><add place="below">^</add> that you 
<lb/>are carrying out my 
<lb/>wishes — It is a regular 
<lb/>bit of law, and is 
<lb/>written on a separate 
<lb/>sheet of same date as 
<lb/>another letter on general 
<lb/>subjects — not a word 
<lb/>about the boys sent 
<lb/>away — This I reject 
<lb/>for I cannot trust 
<lb/><persName>Blair</persName> - <persName>Wikatani</persName>
<lb/>and two others came 
<lb/>up &amp; offered to take 
<lb/>him — He seemed to agree</p>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001982_0005"><!--pb/@n='63r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>My answer amounts 
<lb/>to this — You took the 
<lb/>boys as I understood 
<lb/>to instruct them — I depart 
<lb/>to the <placeName><geogName type="feature">Lake</geogName></placeName> &amp; returning 
<lb/>heard with regret that 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Waller</persName> had been separated 
<lb/>from the Mission —  it 
<lb/>never entered my head 
<lb/>that any objection 
<lb/>could be made to a 
<lb/>member of the mission 
<lb/>becoming a vehicle 
<lb/>of christian benevolence 
<lb/>to poor people living  
<lb/>in the vicinity of 
<lb/>the station
<lb/>I tell him also that 
<lb/>on hearing of his 
<lb/>disinclination to keep

<lb/>The captives attached to 
<lb/>mission by <persName>Bishop 
<lb/>Mackenzie</persName> I at once 
<lb/>offered to provide for 
<lb/>them &amp; send them to the 
<lb/><placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> — — He knew that 
<lb/>then why throw the 
<lb/>six boys among 
<lb/>heathen <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> who 
<lb/>will tell them by the 
<lb/>first opportunity —
<lb/>I also request him 
<lb/>to hand over the 
<lb/>remainder of the boys 
<lb/>to me and I shall still 
<lb/>send them to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>
<lb/>the sentence about 
<lb/>you is as follows</p>

<lb/><p>With respect to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Waller</persName> it would be 
<lb/>wrong in me to take 
<lb/>a side either for or  
<lb/>against him or any 
<lb/>member of the mission 
<lb/>and it would not be 
<lb/>advisable to relieve 
<lb/>the society <del type="cancelled">of</del>from its 
<lb/>obligations to its 
<lb/>agents "Till it pleads <w>ina-
<lb break="no"/>-bility</w>" I hope you have 
<lb/>not given up your 
<lb/>claims to a passage 
<lb/>home — for if you 
<lb/>have we shall be in 
<lb/>a fix - You are quite 
<lb/>welcome to a 
<lb/>passage in the

<lb/>and after <placeName><settlement type="city"><choice><abbr>Johanna</abbr><expan>Johannesburg</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> it 
<lb/>would be more &amp; more 
<lb/>expensive for you 
<lb/>in the matter of passage 
<lb/>every day — I <choice><abbr>dont</abbr><corr>don't</corr></choice>
<lb/>think the bishop will 
<lb/>venture on refusing 
<lb/>a passage but his 
<lb/>letter to me seems to say 
<lb/>if we can we shall 
<lb/>hook the doctor in 
<lb/>for paying his passage 
<lb/>If I am not mistaken 
<lb/>the letter is an effort 
<lb/>of a narrow minded 
<lb/>Sea Lawyer</p>

<lb/><p>You may guess how 
<lb/>anxiously we long for 
<lb/>the rise of the waters 
<lb/>but this as well 
<lb/>as everything else is 
<lb/>in the hands of the 
<lb/>supreme ruler of all 
<lb/>things
<lb/><persName>Blair</persName> has talked a 
<lb/>great deal and much 
<lb/>that appears to me 
<lb/>impossible — one ship — 
<lb/>he told me that the

<lb/>now you speak of his <add place="inline">^</add><add place="above">(<term type="tribe">Wekatani</term>'s)</add>
