<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thompson</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I have just learned that
<lb/>my <term type="nationality">Arabian</term> post office man is detained
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="village">Sesheke</settlement></placeName> by the sickness of one of his
<lb/>party so I am glad of the opportunity
<lb/>to write a little appendix to that <unclear cert="high">hurried</unclear>
<lb/>note of the <date when="1855-09-13">13<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi></date> I particularly wish
<lb/>to express my sympathy in the <w>bereave<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>ment</w> you have been called on to suffer
<lb/>in the departure of your most excellent
<lb/>father in law. I hear of it only now
<lb/>and as I have always since my attendance
<lb/>on his theological lectures and ministry
<lb/>regarded him with very great affection
<lb/>I think of his removal with unfeigned
<lb/>sorrow. May God grant us grace to
<lb/>follow in his footsteps. Unquestionably
<lb/>he served God in his day and generation
<lb/>with rare abilities and unswerving devotion
<lb/>through good &amp; through bad <unclear cert="medium">reports</unclear>. When
<lb/>such are removed we feel somewhat
<lb/>nearer to the grave. There seems to be
<lb/>nothing now between it and us. May
<lb/>we <unclear cert="medium">live</unclear> to Christ and for the prosperity
<lb/>of his great cause and <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> the
<lb/>welcome well done as we have every
<lb/>reason to believe our much lamented

<lb/><add place="above">friend</add>has <del type="cancelled">done</del>. I shall always revere his
<lb/>memory.</p>
<lb/><p>I believe I did not refer very
<lb/>pointedly to what may be called missionary
<lb/>prospects in this region. And the reason is
<lb/>I feel perplexed on one point <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> the
<lb/>insalubrity of the climate. It is no obstacle
<lb/>to myself personally. I think no <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>society's "<unclear cert="medium">zendeling</unclear>" worth his salt. would
<lb/>bolt at that. Even though we have
<lb/>no law against cowardice (vide the 2<hi rend="sup">d Art.</hi>
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Bushman</term> commando mighty men
<lb/>of valour) most of our fellows must
<lb/>feel in the same way. And my better
<lb/>half would go as readily as any one. But
<lb/>I am not clear on exposing my
<lb/>little ones without their own intelligent
<lb/>self dedication. As far as opportunity
<lb/>goes there is no lack. There are tribes
<lb/>and villages withouut number to the North
<lb/>and East of this and all would be proud
<lb/>of the presence of a white man. I
<lb/>know of no hindrance to missionary operations
<lb/>in any part of the country North of
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> and towards the centre
<lb/>of the <placeName><bloc>Continent</bloc></placeName>. And every day we hear
<lb/>of commerce extending its ramifications
<lb/>in all directions. Only think of the
<lb/>way this letter goes. by an <term type="nationality">Arab</term> from

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000870_0003"><!--pb/@n='3'--></pb>
<lb/><placeName><country>Zanzibar</country></placeName> who takes charge of a party of
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term> with ivory for <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>. When
<lb/>they return my <unclear cert="low">late</unclear> companions will
<lb/>be ready to start again. So one relay will
<lb/>always be abroad on business. Before
<lb/>my trip the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> never visited another
<lb/>tribe except to plunder. They have not
<lb/>given this trade up yet, for two forays
<lb/>were made during my absence. (not being 
<lb/>in the country I did not lend my pot <del type="strikethrough">again)</del>
<lb/>What a mercy, the "ill report" <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be
<lb/>retailed in Government House again)
<lb/>But <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">the</add> remedy for that and every evil
<lb/>is being applied. The blessed word of
<lb/>the living God has been preached though
<lb/>in much weakness - and the prayers
<lb/>of <choice><sic>Gods</sic><corr>God's</corr></choice> people are ascending as incense
<lb/>before the throne of the Hope of <placeName><country>Israel</country></placeName>, <del type="strikethrough">and</del>
<lb/>the time is coming, the set time, when
<lb/>all nations shall call Him blessed.</p>
<lb/><p>I have been guilty of some innocent
<lb/>wonderment in seeing it stated in terms
<lb/>lugubrious enough that the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> and <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> &amp;c were not a
<lb/>whit better for all our labours, nay
<lb/>much worse. I followed the rule <choice><sic>invaribly</sic><corr>invariably</corr></choice>
<lb/>of making no enquiries respecting the
<lb/>labours or conduct of other missionaries
<lb/>among <hi rend="underline">natives</hi> and therefore can say



	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000870_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>nothing about <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> or <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>. But
<lb/>about the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> the verdict would I most
<lb/>sincerely think, require reconsideration. During
<lb/>the whole of our sojourn there we strove so to
<lb/>conduct ourselves as that there should be no
<lb/>cause of offence except concerning the law
<lb/>of our God. I feel humbly and heartily
<lb/>thankful to our Heavenly father for enabling
<lb/>us to effect this. <unclear cert="medium">This</unclear> is a point of
<lb/>vital importance in estimating what <choice><sic>has</sic><corr>has</corr></choice>
<lb/>been effected among a people. So when
<lb/>we left we had not one single enemy
<lb/>in the whole tribe x <add place="marginleft"><hi rend="vertical"><note>if it were necessary for me to seek a "character" I 
would confidently refer to the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> for it</note></hi></add><!-- Anne, AJ, note how I've coded this and a similar instance on the next page. This is effectively a note or footnote from Livingstone. It's rarely encountered, but we do have a rule for it, once for which however we have to go back to the Livingstone Online coding guidelines: <http://www.livingstoneonline.ucl.ac.uk/technical/guide/note.html>. In effect, you use the <note> element. AW -->and even when the
<lb/>waggon was inspanned on our departure
<lb/>for <persName>Sebituane</persName>'s country. <persName>Sechele</persName> and
<lb/>his principal <add place="above">men</add><add place="below">^</add> tried to persuade me
<lb/>to remove to the (afterwards) scene of the
<lb/>massacre of his people, offering to build
<lb/>a house and church free of <choice><orig>expence</orig><reg>expense</reg></choice>.
<lb/>I need not refer to my reasons for
<lb/>refusing- (I am perfectly satisfied as to their
<lb/>validity) except that the principal one was
<lb/>determined hostility to the requirements
<lb/>of the gospel unmixed with any hostility
<lb/>to ourselves. Some may think this



	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000870_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/>hostility to the gospel evidence of <w>deterior-
<lb break="no"/>ation</w> from their state of heathenism
<lb/>I believe it to be a most important
<lb/>step in advance from that state.
<lb/>for though they refuse to bow in
<lb/>humility to the Divine law, the truths
<lb/>they hsve imbibed exert a most
<lb/>salutary influence on their morals * <add place="marginleft"><hi rend="vertical"><note><persName>Sechele</persName> asked the Boers on commando not to fight on Sunday. The former beat the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> hollow in lying &amp; meanness - and it would be an insult to compare the honesty of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> with the dishonesty of the Boers</note></hi></add>
<lb/>I know this to be a fact - a plain
<lb/>palpable fact. And if any one
<lb/>doubts it. As he cannot compare
<lb/>what the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> were with what
<lb/>they are let a comparison be
<lb/>made between the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> and
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>. Why in<add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">coming from <term type="tribe">Makololo</term></add> meeting with
<lb/>them and <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">some of the</add> people near <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>who still hate the gospel as much
<lb/>as the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> I used to feel
<lb/>I had entered civilized life, I
<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> wonder at it. The word of
<lb/>the living God has been brought in
<lb/>contact with their hearts &amp;<add place="above">minds</add> His
<lb/>word has life and power. Few



	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000870_0006"><!--pb/@n='3v'--></pb>
<lb/>human <unclear cert="high">souls</unclear> can withstand its force
<lb/>and no hatred however deep can
<lb/>quench its power. I bless God
<lb/>from the bottom of my heart for
<lb/>allowing me to sow the good seed
<lb/>among the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>. Their present
<lb/>posture is a terrible one if they continue
<lb/>so to the end. But though they do <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">so</add> it
<lb/>is God's will the offer should be made
<lb/>though thousands both white and black
<lb/>make a bad use of it. You will probably
<lb/>live longer than I shall. Remember
