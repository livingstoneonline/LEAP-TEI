<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p>Through mercy we are now
<lb/>near the end of our journey. Have met
<lb/>with no accidents - the health of all very
<lb/>good. For the mercies we enjoy we
<lb/>thank Him who has been our protector
<lb/>night and day. A lion came up to
<lb/>us at the <unclear cert="low">meritsowe</unclear> but was driven
<lb/>off by the shouting of the people
<lb/>The <term type="bodypart">lungs</term> of <persName>Khalincele</persName> you may
<lb/>be sure did their duty: We have
<lb/>heard the roar frequently since but
<lb/>that is all. &amp; we wish we may never
<lb/>experience more. We have been
<lb/>very unsuccessful in securing the
<lb/>game we wounded. Two <w>spring-

<lb/>we have got. <add place="above">An ostrich nest twice - good eggs</add> The goats give a little milk
<lb/>morning &amp; evening and are thus very

<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Evans</persName> met us this evening
<lb/>He has not succeeded with <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>but has with <persName>Sekomi</persName>. <persName>Cumming</persName>
<lb/>seems to have forestalled him. I feel
<lb/>sorry I was not there when <persName>Evans</persName>
<lb/>came through. I think <persName>Sechele</persName> has
<lb/>a prejudice against him ever since
<lb/>he was there in partnership with
<lb/><persName>Greig</persName>. I might have removed part
<lb/>of it. I think it would be more
<lb/>for his advantage to deal with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hume</persName>
<lb/>than with <persName>Cumming</persName>. The latter has
<lb/>always been very anxious that he should
<lb/>conclude a bargain to deal with him
<lb/>exclusively &amp; may have managed it
<lb/>so now.</p>
<lb/><p>We spent sunday at <placeName><settlement type="village">Setlagole</settlement></placeName> - had

<lb/>the chief too knows the letters but cannot

<lb/>what the <term type="nationality">Griquas</term> will do in his country <!-- Tagged "Griquas" as nationality as I think they are meant as a group larger than a tribe, but I could be wrong HB 10-23-13 -->
<lb/>before he returns to it. We could not come
<lb/>by a straighter course as we intended, the
<lb/>big <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> being too heavy for travelling
