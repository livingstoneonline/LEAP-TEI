<lb/><p rend="center">My Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p rend="center">The chief object of this letter is to advise you
<lb/>of the departure of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi><choice><orig>Livingston</orig><reg>Livingstone</reg></choice></persName> and four <choice><sic>chidren</sic><corr>children</corr></choice> on board the

<lb/><p>In thus committing my family to your care I may state
<lb/>that nothing but the fullest convictions of duty would have
<lb/>led me to adopt this step, but having already addressed you
<lb/>twice on this subject, and by full and explicit statements
<lb/>endeavored to furnish data on which to form your
<lb/>own <choice><sic>Judgement</sic><corr>Judgment</corr></choice>, I feel the less inclined to advert to the subject
<lb/>again. Your silence however makes me fear that my
<lb/>letters may have miscarried, and I shall add that our chidren have
<lb/>claims on those by whom <hi rend="underline">we</hi> are sent. It is well known that <!-- There is a line drawn on the letter separating the next section from the previous- unsure how to code HB 7-1-13 -->

<lb/>author. But missionaries expose their children to a contamination
<lb/>which they have had no hand in producing. We expose them 
<lb/>and ourselves for a time in order to elevate those sad captives
<lb/>of sin and satan who are the victims of the degradation
<lb/>of ages. None of those who complain about missionaries
<lb/>sending their chidren home ever descend to this. And again
<lb/>as <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> James</persName> in his "young men from home" forcibly shews
<lb/>a greater misfortune cannot befall a youth than to be cast
<lb/>into the world entirely without a home. In regard to even 
<lb/>the vestige of a home my children are absolutely vagabonds

<lb/><p>I intend to leave this during the course of the next week. 
<lb/>I need scarcely again advert to the plans which in consequence
<lb/>of what I believe to be the direct leadings of Providence I have
<lb/>been led to form. In passing in to the distant region to which
<lb/>I feel called. I shall have to mourn over the defection of <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>now more apparent than ever. By letters which I have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>since I have come to <placeName><settlement type="town">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> I learn that <persName>Sechele</persName> has
<lb/>plundered an <term type="nationality">Englishman</term> whom he believed to have killed
<lb/>one of his people. I have little doubt but such is the fact
<lb/>The <term type="nationality">Englishman</term> being a person of immoral character and the
<lb/>companion of the missing native declares that the <term type="nationality">Englishman</term>
<lb/>inflicted injuries sufficient to terminate life &amp; then left him.
<lb/>Two companions of this same man (<persName>Moyle</persName>) have perished in suspicious
<lb/>circumstances. One of them named <persName>Dalman</persName> perished near to 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> but being <choice><sic>in</sic><corr>on</corr></choice> the way to <placeName><settlement type="town">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> at the time of his
<lb/>death I can give no particulars. The plunder of <persName>Moyle</persName> by <persName>Sechele</persName>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000750_0003"><!--pb/@n='3'--></pb>
<lb/>is quite unjustifiable and as I stated before I believe <persName>Sechele</persName> is an
<lb/>apostate. He cannot be referred to as a trophy of grace but never
<lb/>did man bid fairer for years to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
<lb/>than he. You will see no success in that region so long as
<lb/><persName>Inglis</persName> and <persName>Edwards</persName> are your missionaries. It would be absurd to
<lb/>expect the Divine blessing. I am sorry to write so but it is the
<lb/>truth, and truth which ought to be known by the Directors. I do
<lb/>not wish to be or appear censorious but were I now placed
<lb/>in the most solemn circumstances my past experience of the
<lb/>vicinity of these men would lead me to declare that it is a
<lb/>mere waste of life to labour near <w>the<add place="inline">m</add></w><del type="strikethrough">se men</del>. Eight years
<lb/>experience has only strengthened the conviction that our Society
<lb/>would be incalculably more useful were there a safety valve
<lb/>by which such characters would be let off.</p>
