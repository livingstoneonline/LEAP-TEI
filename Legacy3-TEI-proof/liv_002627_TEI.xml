<lb/>in <date when="1872-08">August 1872</date>. Postal arrangements
<lb/>are scarcely perfect all over the
<lb/>world yet - but I was thankful to
<lb/>get anything at all - I was plundered
<lb/>of large amounts of goods <unclear cert="high">I own</unclear>
<lb/>several times through my money
<lb/>being handed over without any
<lb/>precautions that I know of to an
<lb/>oily tongued Banian, and by the <!-- Should "Banian" be coded as a tribe here? HB 12-23-13 -->
<lb/>connivance of the <persName>governor
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="town">Unyanyembe</settlement></placeName></persName> the stores were
<lb/>nearly all plundered by members
<lb/>of a slave trading ring or coterie
<lb/>and every effort made by the
<lb/>destruction of my letters to prevent

<lb/>bottom of all the villainy alone had
<lb/>the <term type="bodypart">ear</term> of my friend, and on the
<lb/>strength of a note from his agent
<lb/><persName>Shereef</persName> who sold off all my goods
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="town">Ujiji</settlement></placeName> for slaves and ivory
<lb/>which stated that he was about to
<lb/>send off slaves with all I needed,
<lb/>the half truth was uttered "that
<lb/>all <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi><choice><abbr>L</abbr><expan>Livingstone</expan></choice></persName>'s wants had been supplied"
<lb/>and it was repeated in the house of
<lb/>Lords. the little sent was so little and so
<lb/>inferior, it was intended to force
<lb/>me back - the slaves solem<add place="below">^</add><add place="above">n</add>ly swore
<lb/>that they were instructed by the highest
<lb/>authority to force me back, and they
<lb/>persisted in this all over the country.
<lb/>In fact quite overacted their part.
<lb/>All expected me to die &amp; deprived of
<lb/>nearly all European comforts
<lb/>for two years it is a wonder that
<lb/>their expectations did not come true

<lb/>all the slaving in <placeName><region>Manyuema</region></placeName>, and I gave

<lb/>they work it quietly &amp; well for the

<lb/>as soon as captured or at least long

<lb/>braving of death &amp; danger to serve me
<lb/>as a son might have done - thanks
<lb/>for the notices of your family - I can
<lb/>recollect them only as children &amp; would
<lb/>pass them on the street unwittingly - <persName>Ralph</persName>

<lb/>calculated to elicit all the pith &amp; unction
<lb/>in you, and you were very happy in your
<lb/>charge - your friends paid a graceful
<lb/>tribute to you in <unclear cert="low">franking</unclear> you home
<lb/>and back again, and conferred honour
<lb/>on themselves. May they long flourish
<lb/>in doing similar deeds. Glad to hear
<lb/>that the <term type="nationality">Africanders</term> have got diamonds
<lb/>they first set the example of plundering
<lb/>me at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> - if they heard of the

<lb/>they would make amends by sending me
