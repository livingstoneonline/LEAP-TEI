<lb/><p>My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p><space dim="horizontal" extent="14" unit="chars"/> I could not have been
<lb/>more surprised by your own personal
<lb/>appearance at <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> than I was
<lb/>by that of <persName>George Fleming</persName> on the <date when="1856-07-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date><unclear cert="medium">Ult.</unclear>
<lb/>preparations you had made for my
<lb/>comfort in travel it appeared like
<lb/>a scene we see in dreaming. <del type="cancelled">and</del>
<lb/>I had begun to fancy my letters contained
<lb/>an order forthwith to return whence
<lb/>I had come. On perusal however
<lb/>I found that I am somewhat to blame
<lb/>in not stating explicitly my intention
<lb/>to go from <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName> to <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> soon <!-- Adrian, would you supply the current spellings of these places? ie Tette spelt Tete. Also, both these places are cities now, but they were presumably towns then. Justin 2013-07-17-->
<lb/>after the dispatch of my letters and
<lb/>thence proceed to <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. I had

    

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000911_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>mentioned my plans so often I <w>un-
<lb break="no"/>-fortunately</w> took it for granted that all
<lb/>my friends knew them perfectly. And
<lb/>when the <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><sic>Tett</sic><corr>Tette</corr></choice></settlement></placeName> packet left I intended to
<lb/>proceed down the river in a few days
<lb/>afterwards. Indeed I fully expected to
<lb/>overtake it at <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> but my
<lb/>good friend <persName>Major T. A. d'A Sicard</persName>
<lb/>the commandant of <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName> generously
<lb/>advised me to remain <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> the

<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="feature">Delta</geogName></placeName><choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice><date when="1856-04">April</date>. I was not
<lb/>without need of rest for our cattle
<lb/>having all been killed by Tsetse
<lb/>I had a severe spell of trudging on
<lb/>foot and had become tired 
<lb/>and thin enough. My men got
<lb/>food from the worthy Major
<lb/>and employment in carrying
<lb/>wood &amp; in canoe work also

<lb/>about 16 came down with me to <placeName><settlement type="town">Senna</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>eight returned thence to <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName> and eight
<lb/>came to <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> but were glad
<lb/>to go back too for there was a famine
<lb/>in the land which cut off thousands
<lb/>My head man named <persName>Sekwebu</persName>
<lb/>I have taken with me - a sensible
<lb/>worthy heathen, but for whose tact
<lb/>and knowledge of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Zambesi</geogName></placeName> language <!-- Is there a better way to code Zambesi as DL is talking about the language not the geog. feature? HB 9-2-13 -->
<lb/>I might not have been here today
<lb/>The rest about 110 are to remain
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="town">Tette</settlement></placeName><choice><sic>till</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> I return to take them
<lb/>to their own land again. Such was
<lb/>my plan but a short time before 
<lb/>the arrival of the Frolic I got a letter
<lb/>from the Directors by way of <placeName><country><w>Mosam-
<lb break="no"/>bique</w></country></placeName> in which I am told that "they
<lb/>are restricted in their power of aiding
<lb/>plans connected only remotely with
<lb/>the spread of the gospel." and they
<lb/>add that even though certain

    

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000911_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>obstacles (<term type="ailment">fever</term>, tsetse &amp;c.) should prove
<lb/>surmountable "the financial circumstances
<lb/>of the society are not as such as to afford
<lb/>any ground of <gap extent="2" unit="chars" agent="blotting"/> hope that it would 
<lb/>be in a position within any definite
<lb/>period to undertaken untried, remote
<lb/>and difficult fields of labour." I had
<lb/>imagined in my simplicity that both
<lb/>my preaching conversation and
<lb/>travel were as nearly connected with
<lb/>the spread of the gospel as the Boers
<lb/>would allow them to be. The plan
<lb/>of opening up a path from either
<lb/>the <placeName><region>East</region></placeName> or <placeName><region>West coast</region></placeName> for the
<lb/>teeming population of the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>
<lb/>was submitted to their judgement
<lb/>and secured their formal approbation
<lb/>I have been seven times in peril
<lb/>of my life from savage men

<lb/>swerving pursuing that plan, and 
<lb/>never doubted by that I was in the
<lb/>path of duty. Indeed so clearly did
<lb/>I <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> that I was performing
<lb/>good service to the cause of Christ    
<lb/>I wrote to my brother that I would
<lb/>perish rather than fail in my
<lb/>enterprise. I shall not boast of what
<lb/>I have done but the wonderful
<lb/>mercies I have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> will constrain
<lb/>me to follow out the work in spite
<lb/>of the veto of the Board. If it is
<lb/>according to the will of God means

<lb/><p>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> all the articles sent
<lb/>in charge of <persName>Captain Peyton</persName> and

<lb/>bedding stockings &amp;c. were most
<lb/>welcome and did not come certainly
<lb/>before they were needed. Some
<lb/>woolen articles and others which
<lb/>would spoil by keeping I directed
<lb/>to be sold and others as the desk
<lb/>and work box I left at <placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>for future use. The money <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice>
<lb/>fifty sovereigns and 500 <term type="nationality">Spanish</term>
<lb/>dollars I took with me. I have
<lb/>some debts against me up the river
<lb/>for clothing &amp;c. of which though my
<lb/>kind friends there refused to give
<lb/>a formal account I consider
<lb/>myself bound to repay by bringing
<lb/>articles which I know they require

<lb/>at once I leave it for a future

<lb/><p>I was happy to see <persName>Ralph</persName>'s name

<lb/>at the college. Hope he will profit
<lb/>largely by the mental discipline he

<lb/>our great Creator in his day and

<lb/>them Boer names as having no
<lb/><persName>Wardlaw</persName> blood in them. "My Dear 
<lb/>Wife" you say, and I knew not you
<lb/>had one. Of course I fell into a quandary
<lb/>as to who had taken charge of you,
<lb/>if she had a long nose or red hair,
<lb/>or squinted, but I was obliged at last
