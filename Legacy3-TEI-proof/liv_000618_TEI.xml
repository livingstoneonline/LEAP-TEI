<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p>As we are in daily expectation of the 
<lb/>arrival of your better half we feel as if the worse 
<lb/>did not deserve a letter ᅳ This is plain enough is it 
<lb/>not? It is perhaps rather a sort of nervousness 
<lb/>produced by stretching our necks frequently to 
<lb/>see if the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> is in sight that quite indisposes 
<lb/>us to write. We wish heartily she would come 
<lb/>&amp; relieve our suspense May be after all she 
<lb/>is snugly at supper giving the <term type="foodstuff">meat</term> two 
<lb/>taps with her knife before she cuts it by way 
<lb/>of <unclear cert="medium">alagaing</unclear> it to make it more digestible</p>
<lb/><p>A <bibl>report</bibl> furnished by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lauga</persName> respecting 
<lb/>the <orgName>party of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Arkwright</persName> &amp; <persName>Christie</persName></orgName> made us 
<lb/>think a little. We saw nothing improper in 
<lb/>their conduct while proceeding Northward and 
<lb/>now that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> returns We have neither seen 
<lb/>nor heard anything which induces us to believe 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Lauga</expan></choice></persName>'s <bibl>report</bibl> as having originated in him 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> has been here three days &amp; neither he nor 
<lb/><orgName>his people</orgName> have <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> any disposition towards 
<lb/>illicit intercourse. He is the son of a <term type="occupation">clergyman</term></p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000618_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>&amp; if there is truth in what <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Lauga</expan></choice></persName> mentioned it must 
<lb/>have been perpetrated by <persName>Christie</persName> &amp; not by <persName>Arkwright</persName>
<lb/>the latter I believe abstains from traveling on 
<lb/>Sunday in accordance with a request of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Ashton</persName> and if he has so much respect for 
<lb/>a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> as to accede in one particular 
<lb/>he surely would not be guilty attempting to take 
<lb/>a <term type="occupation">prostitute</term> into <orgName>his company</orgName> a deed he knows 
<lb/>would soon be published over the whole 
<lb/>country. We have found him <choice><sic>agreable</sic><corr>agreeable</corr></choice> &amp; kind 
<lb/>&amp; he has during his whole sojourn here behaved 
<lb/>like a gentleman I say this much because 
<lb/>I feel it would be unfair to condemn any one 
<lb/>unless the evidence is pretty strong &amp; decided. Both 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>Ch.</abbr><expan>Christie</expan></choice></persName> have <term type="nationality">English</term> <term type="occupation">servants</term> who have 
<lb/>been <term type="occupation">soldiers</term>. They may have given <choice><sic>occassion</sic><corr>occasion</corr></choice>
<lb/>to the <bibl>report</bibl> above referred to</p>
<lb/><p>We go on much as usual. Walls of school 
<lb/>six feet high ᅳ  Measurement 48 by 20 ᅳ this morning
<lb/>Hope to finish it this month ᅳ We have much better 
<lb/>soil for building where the school is than we had 
<lb/>in this house - <persName>Apie</persName> came last week &amp; passed 
<lb/>on to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> ᅳ All is peace But we are 
<lb/>sorry to hear a report of <persName>Cumming</persName> lying ill at the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakaas</term> ᅳ Hope it is not true ᅳ <persName>Paul</persName> was in</p>

<lb/><term type="plant">reeds</term> &amp; after trying in vain to lift two <term type="tribe">Bakwenas</term> from 
<lb/>the ground ran off ᅳ the men were hurt but will 
<lb/>recover the guns were at a distance &amp; they had no trees 
<lb/>A <orgName>Hottentot</orgName> is left here with a broken <term type="bodypart">thigh</term> bone

<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> presented me with an excellent gun in its case &amp;c.

<lb/><p>I send to you three full grown <term type="plant_foodstuff">fruits of the

<lb/>How will the following motion in next <orgName><choice><abbr>Com.</abbr><expan>Committee</expan></choice></orgName> do 
<lb/>"that as certain friends of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Lauga</expan></choice></persName> ignorant of the 
<lb/>fact that he took no part in the translation of the 
<lb/><bibl>new testament</bibl> have produced the impression in 
<lb/>the country that he has not <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> his full share 
<lb/>of the honours belonging thereto, We now avoid 
<lb/>the production of a similar impression by 
<lb/>referring his translation of <bibl>Isaiah</bibl> to the Judgements 
<lb/>of our esteemed <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> of the <orgName>French Society</orgName>"
<lb/>Translate <bibl>Isaiah</bibl> by all means &amp; if we have
