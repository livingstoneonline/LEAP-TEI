<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Hooker</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 3 words ">                        </span>Many thanks for your 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>kind letter by the Pioneer. We had just 
<br/>returned from the <span class="">Makololo country</span> &amp; 
<br/>contemplated a long run up the <span class="">Rovuma</span>
<br/>so I thought it would be as well to wait 
<br/>before answering you till I had something 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to write about. <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk </span>wished to 
<br/>go home as by the <span class="">Victoria fall</span> journey 
<br/>he had pretty well worked up the 
<br/>botany of a large section of the country 
<br/>but when he heard of a new steamer 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and a new field up <span class="">Rovuma</span> he 
<br/>was willing enough to stay - We failed 
<br/>at the <span class="">Rovuma</span> chiefly because the 
<br/>new vessel is too deep - then came 
<br/>round to the <span class="">Shire</span> intending to examine 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the <span class="">Rovuma</span> from above downwards 
<br/>and have again failed. We carried a 
<br/>boat past the <span class="">cataracts</span> then sailed 
<br/>about 60 miles up the <span class="">Upper Shire - </span>

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>and some 225 up the Lake. We found it 
<br/>very deep - and from 20 to 50 miles broad
<br/>the length is that above indicated though 
<br/>we say only over 200 miles. The country 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>around is all highland or mountainous 
<br/>and sudden storms come down which 
<br/>raise seas in which no open boat could 
<br/>live. We were there during the Equinoctial 
<br/>gales and it would have been 
foolhardi-<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>ness to have crossed to the Eastern shore 
<br/>at that period. When we came to near 
<br/>the North end, or where the people go 
<br/>round it, no food was to be had, and 
<br/>wherever we went we saw skeletons 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and putrid bodies of the slain the handiwork 
<br/>of a tribe of Zulus called Mazita or 
<br/>Mazite. I met seven of them and they 
<br/>were as much afraid of me as I ought 
<br/>to have been of them. they would not 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>take me to their chief. the country was 
<br/>depopulated so we were obliged to return 
<br/>and be content with the most contradictory 
<br/>reports of Rovuma ever heard. One man 
<br/>of intelligence and with no motive we 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span> 
<br/>could imagine for deception, would 
<br/>assert positively that we could sail out 
<br/>of the Lake into the river - Another would 
<br/>say we must lift it <span class="add  above">(the boat)</span> a mile - another 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>fifty miles - a fourth a hundred &amp; 
<br/>in one point alone did all agree it was 
<br/>"a very large river". The reason why 
<br/>we want an outlet there is the Portuguese 
<br/>follow us everywhere and introduce 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>slaving. When we took the bishop 
<br/>up to a spot about 15 miles south 
<br/>of <span class="">Zomba</span> we met Portuguese slavers 
<br/>returning from near that mountain 
<br/>with lots of captives - we took them &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>gave them over to the bishop to be 
<br/>operated on by His Reverence secund-
<br/>em Artem high Churchii. <span class="sup ">x</span> We have 
<br/>plenty of cotton for the collecting but 
<br/>no Englishman will submit to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Portuguese officials. We shall be 
<br/>engaged for the best part of a year 
<br/>in carrying a steamer past the 
<br/>cataracts. We expect her soon and 
<br/>the parts to be screwed together.

<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="">Kirk</span> will tell you about the palm oil nut 
<br/>found on the Lake. It is not half the size of that 
<br/>on the West coast &amp; is not used for anything
<br/>It cannot be of any value for they collect 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>an insect not bigger than our smallest 
<br/>gnat and boil them into cakes which are 
<br/>used as a relish with other food. I expect 
<br/>some of the real nut from <span class="">Loanda</span> for planting. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am very glad to hear that you are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>going to bring out a Genera Plantarum 
<br/>we have often talked about &amp; felt 
<br/>angry that you did not come out more
<br/>For the sake of your family you ought to 
<br/>be more of a popularity hunter - "Bosh" 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="add  above">you say</span> "Teach your grand mother" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. We think 
<br/>before hand how all your friends would 
<br/>feel if any of the Nobodies should be 
<br/>lifted over your head. Be as angry as 
<br/>you like with me I repeat you ought 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to make yourself more known. Could 
<br/>you not do something in the popular 
<br/>line with your Museum. there is nothing 
<br/>mean in it - see how <span class="">Playfair</span> and 
<br/><span class="">Sir Roderick</span> get on. It is all fair 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>and above board. </p>

<br/><p class="p ">We have been sadly vexed by <span class="">Rae</span>
<br/>and the boxes five of which were lately 
<br/>seen at <span class="">Mozambique</span> without any 
<br/>addresses. He was entrusted to address 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>them to your father when he should 
<br/>get paint. Some boxes had "<span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span>" 
<br/>on the corner. <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Burrup</span> the 
missi-<br/>onary who saw them added "<span class="">England</span>" 
<br/>a wide direction enough. One box 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>with no address contained birds 
<br/>and belongs to my brother. I have 
<br/>been bothered enough by my 
com-<br/>panions, but did not expect <span class="">Rae</span>
<br/>to act this way. If all had been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>like <span class="">Kirk</span> I should have had smooth 
<br/>sailing. </p>
<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Meller</span> is very industrious 
<br/>but many of his specimens will 
<br/>be duplicates of <span class="">Kirk's</span>. I feel 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>annoyed because many of the 
<br/>plants from <span class="">Zomba</span> were the 
<br/>same as <span class="">Welwitsch</span> got on the 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span> 
<br/>highlands of <span class="">Angola</span>. Ours were 
<br/>collected long ago and but for <span class="">Rae's</span>
<br/>conduct would have been registered

<br/>regards to <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Hooker</span>, and to your

<br/>years unexpected separation. Has 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>your eldest boy taken to anything
<br/>My hopeful ran away from 
<br/>his tutor lately. They were trying 
<br/>to cram him <span class="add  above">with Latin &amp; Greek</span> if I understand 
<br/>rightly, and thrashing was threatened 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>so off he went. Our friend <span class="">Playfair</span>
<br/>helped at this juncture &amp; he is now 
<br/>at a school at <span class="">St Andrews</span>. It is
