<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 4 words ">                                </span>Your most welcome 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>letter of April last came to hand by two of 
<br/>the <span class="">Oxford</span> and <span class="">Cambridge</span> missionaries 
<br/>who without knowing a word of the 
<br/>language or a bit of the way came up 
<br/>this river in common country <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: canoes.">canoes</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>This has never yet been accomplished 
<br/>by a single Portuguese </p>
<br/><p class="p ">From a small section of this river - 
<br/>say six miles, to which we were limited 
<br/>by our vessel being too deep to run up 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and down. we bought at a very cheap 
<br/>rate about 300 lbs of excellent clean cotton 
<br/>It was not the period of the cotton crop 
<br/>and had we not been employed elsewhere 
<br/>double the quantity could easily have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>been obtained. the people had not been 
<br/>stimulated by the prospect of a regular 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>market to plant more than they meant for 
<br/>their own use, and having ourselves been 
<br/>cheated in our supply of calico we had to 
<br/>offer them the most worthless <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">hash</span> you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>can <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> in payment. But calico 
<br/>is here in very great demand. You must 
<br/>not imagine that we are here among the 
<br/>"Gonakeds." Every one is clothed with 
<br/>the inner bark of a certain tree and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>calico is so highly valued that the very 
<br/>best slaves cost only five yards valued 
<br/>out here at 2/6. Women and children 
<br/>go for two yards or one shilling. You can 
<br/>get any work done for calico. But a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>great difficulty meets us here. 1 We 
<br/>shew the way. 2 We open the markets 
<br/>3 We so gain the confidence of the natives 
<br/>that to any man of common sense 
<br/>life and property are perfectly secure. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Are Government servants to become 
<br/>besides public cotton collectors? I 
<br/>think that after we have accomplished 
<br/>these three important results in any one 
<br/>part of the country there are work is 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span> 
<br/>done. This <span class="">lower Shire valley</span> <span class="add  above">&amp; hills adjacent</span> produce<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">s</span>
<br/>an immense quantity of cotton superior 
<br/>to common American. Who is to collect 
<br/>it, and after it is collected are the Portuguese 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>to be allowed to put a tax on it while 
<br/>all Portuguese productions go out 
<br/>free. We go onwards. We are now 
<br/>going down to the sea expecting to meet 
<br/>a steamer built at <span class="">Glasgow</span> in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>compartments, and every man of us 
<br/>will be employed during the best 
<br/>part of a twelve month in 
trans-<br/>porting it past <span class="">Murchison's cataracts</span>
<br/>I look back therefore to see if any 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>advantage is to be taken of our 
<br/>labours among a people now all 
<br/>friendly - witness the passage of these 
<br/>missionaries - and I see only the 
<br/>Portuguese erecting a fort at the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>mouth of the <span class="">Shire.</span></p>
<br/><p class="p ">With respect to the finer kinds 
<br/>of cotton the sea island, it really 
<br/>flourishes in this country with very 
<br/><br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span> 
<br/>little care. the soil of both the <span class="">lower 
<br/>and upper Shire </span> contains a considerable 
<br/>quantity of salt. the people even extract 
<br/>salt for their food out of it. this may 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>be the reason why it takes so kindly 
<br/>to the soil. But we have besides an 
<br/>indignous cotton which shews an 
<br/>inch and a half staple. We found it 
<br/>below <span class="">Victoria falls</span> on the <span class="">Zambesi</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and again at the upper end of <span class="">Lake 
<br/>Nyassa</span> With the idea of a colony 
<br/>I throughly agree and I expect <span class="add  above">soon</span> to 
<br/>meet a <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Stewart,</span> a minister I 
<br/>believe of the free church of Scotland 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>who has come out to consult me 
<br/>on this very point. The object is partly 
<br/>religious. <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">and</span> with a view to influence 
<br/>the slave trade. and I suppose to benefit 
<br/>our honest poor. Besides cotton we could 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>grow wool on all our highlands and 
<br/>instead of being considered intruders 
<br/>would be looked on by the natives as 
<br/>benefactors. </p>

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/><p class="p ">When we went up to the highlands East 
<br/>of <span class="">Murchison's cataract's</span> to introduce the 
<br/>bishop to the Mangangja - (pronounced 
<br/>Mañ-anja. g not heard) we met Portuguese 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>slave hunters returning with large numbers 
<br/>of captives - An extensive system of slave 
<br/>hunting had been been set agoing by instigating 
<br/>a tribe called Ajawa to attack village 
<br/>after village of Manganja - kill the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>men and sell the women &amp; children to 
<br/>the Portuguese. All the captives met fell 
<br/>with my hands and I presented them to 
<br/>the bishop to begin school with. the 
<br/>piecemeal destruction going on along 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>their borders produced no effort at 
<br/>union for mutual defence among the 
<br/>Manganja - All were fleeing. So in order 
<br/>to prevent the country around the mission 
<br/>from becoming depopulated and to stop 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the effusion of blood we went to try what 
<br/>a conference would do. On approaching 
<br/>the Ajawa all our declarations of peace 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span> 
<br/>were nullified by some Manganja followers 
<br/>trying to frighten the enemy by calling out 
<br/>that one of their great sorcerers had come 
<br/>Unfortunately it did not strike me that we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>were thereby deprived of the protection of 
<br/>our English name till afterwards - they 
<br/>rushed at us like furies and shot at 
<br/>us with muskets and poisoned arrows 
<br/>at about 50 yards distance. We were obliged 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to drive them off with our firearms - the 
<br/>Manganja alone suffered from the weapons 
<br/>of the Ajawa. The bishop has since 
<br/>gone to drive away other companies 
<br/>of Ajawa who were destroying his 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>people though I thought he ought to have 
<br/>acted only on the defensive as we did. 
<br/>This slave hunting has depopulated large 
<br/>tracts of as fine land as any in the world 
<br/>And as the Portuguese encourage it - 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>the authorities keeping discreetly in the 
<br/>background much more territory will 
<br/>be laid waste. A colony would be a 
<br/>defensive nucleus for fugitives from 
<br/>the slave hunters. the bishop has 200 

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span> 
<br/>freed people on his station and a large 
<br/>population is collecting around him. </p>
<br/><p class="p "> On the <span class="">Upper shire</span> we found thousands 
<br/>of fugitives. We carried a boat past the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>cataracts and sailed up into <span class="">Lake Nyassa</span>
<br/>We found it to be a very deep lake. 
<br/>A ship could find ancorage only near 
<br/>the shore. Our leadline gave no bottom at 
<br/>210 feet in the south and in the north 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>we felt bottom with a fishing line at 600 
<br/>feet in a bay. A mile outside we could 
<br/>find no bottom at 696 feet. It is 
<br/>from 20 to 50 miles broad - Over 200 
<br/>miles long and surrounded by 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>mountains and high uplands. the 
<br/>population is prodigiously large 
<br/>but slavery is the only trade. An 
<br/>Arab vessel called a dhow fled from 
<br/>us full of slaves to the East shore 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>twice. We were on the West and it was 
<br/>so stormy during the Equinoctial gales 
<br/>(September) we could not cross in an 
<br/>open boat. The dhow had lately been built 

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span> 
<br/>and <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low"><span class="">Colonel Rigby</span></span> our consul at <span class="">Zanzibar</span>
<br/>says in a letter published in the "Times" that 
<br/>nearly all the slaves come from <span class="">Nyassa</span> &amp; 
<br/>the valley of the Shire and a small steamer 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>on the lake would break the neck of 
<br/>the trade. We shall now set ourselves to 
<br/>this work. then look for an outlet for 
<br/>ourselves by the <span class="">Rovuma.</span> We could 
<br/>obtain no accurate information about 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it except that it was a very large river 
<br/>In this all agreed but its distance from 
<br/>the <span class="">Lake</span> varied from a few yards to 50 
<br/>miles </p>
<br/><p class="p "> I suppose that the Government will 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>pay for the steamer after we have put 
<br/>it on the Lake - but do not know. 
<br/>It was built by my friends in <span class="">Glasgow</span>
<br/>and the builders "Tod &amp; Macgregor" take 
<br/>nothing <span class="add  above">from me</span> until they see whether any thing 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>will be granted. The expenses of this 
<br/>steamer <span class="add  above">(Pioneer) &amp;</span> all her crew are great £ 11,000 
<br/>but next year they will be less. 
<br/>The Pioneer is unfortunately too deep 
<br/>A splendid strong good vessel with this 

	<span class="pb-title">0009</span> 
<br/>one fault. Were she on the <span class="">Lake</span> she 
<br/>would be admirable. I do not grumble 
<br/>about her I am most thankful to 
<br/>have her, but with half her draught as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>was intended in the plan she would 
<br/>have gone up any of the <span class="">East African</span>
<br/>rivers. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">The kind of people that would 
<br/>suit this country would be families 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of the agricultural class - men that 
<br/>could turn their hands to anything - 
<br/>build their own huts - make their 
<br/>own doors - tables - chairs, everything 
<br/>They ought to form their first 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>establishment on the highlands 
<br/>and as they became acclimatized 
<br/>descend to lower levels. This is 
<br/>what I have recommended for 
<br/>the Mission, and they will in all 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>probability enjoy good health - If 
<br/>the obstacle presented by Portuguese 

	<span class="pb-title">0010</span> 
<br/>were removed, either by free access 
<br/>being given - (It is not withheld now 
<br/>but the placing of posts or stations 
<br/>everywhere on our line of entrance, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>shews what is intended) or by our 
<br/>finding an entrance by Rovuma 
<br/>I would say send at once. some 
<br/>preparation might be made but 
<br/>a year must elapse ere we are 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>on the Lake with our steamer. 
<br/>and then there is difficulty of the 
<br/>Pioneer's draught. She could take 
<br/>cargo or people up either <span class="">Shire</span> or 
<br/>Rovuma during but a part of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the year. the benefits to be derived 
<br/>from a small colony of industrious 
<br/>people in stimulating the people 
<br/>of the country to cultivate largely 
<br/>cannot well be over-rated. I am 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>supporting that besides cultivating 

	<span class="pb-title">0011</span> 
<br/>cotton themselves they would purchase 
<br/>the produce of the natives with calico. 
<br/>Beyond all doubt slave trading would 
<br/>soon die a natural death. When 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>we entered the <span class="">Lake</span> on the 2<span class="sup underline ">nd</span> September 
<br/>among the crowds that pressed around 
<br/>us I said to an intelligent man 
<br/>who had been down at the coast 
<br/>" We come today only to see the Lake 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>but next year we shall come in a 
<br/>ship to buy cotton and ivory. but 
<br/>no slaves." After thinking some 
<br/>time he addressed the crowd, going 
<br/>over what I had said, and added 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>" I see plainly that these people will 
<br/>enrich us. " they can see at once the 
<br/>benefits we propose to confer but 
<br/>the work must be done by many 
<br/>hands, and it is encouraging to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>remember that while benefitting 
<br/>Africans we are bestowing a boon 

	<span class="pb-title">0012</span> 
<br/>upon our own poor. <span class="">the bishop</span> thought 
<br/>that introduction of whites would drive 
<br/>the blacks into a corner, but when I 
<br/>went up with him to the highlands 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>he spontaneously remarked, I see you 
<br/>are quite right there is abundance of 
<br/>room for all - He is high church 
<br/>but there being no one to laugh at or oppose 
<br/>the pretensions of that party it cannot 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>flourish out here - To be anything 
<br/>is better than heathenism and if the 
<br/>mission only works for the benefit 
<br/>of the people I don't care though they 
<br/>should pretend to be able to stand on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>their heads as well as forgive sins. </p>
