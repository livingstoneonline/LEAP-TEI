<br/>
<br/><p class="p noindent">Dear <span class="">Captain Washington</span></p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">We found that 35 tons was 
<br/>more than Pioneer could carry - 
<br/>took out 5 tons at <span class="">Shupanga</span>
<br/>and avoided the strong current 
<br/>now in <span class="add  above"> - parts of</span> the <span class="">Zambesi</span> of 4 1/2 knots 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>by going into shallow places. 
<br/>This unfortunately led us aground 
<br/>four or five miles above 
<br/><span class="">Shupanga</span> and the river is 
<br/>falling. It is the worst grounding 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>we ever had for we have 100 
<br/>yards of shoal on our lee or 
<br/>down river from us. I let 
<br/>you know lest you hear something 
<br/>worse. I was unable to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>do duty when she might have 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>been got off but <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Young</span> is 
<br/>said by <span class="">Captain Wilson</span> to be 
<br/>"a thorough sailor", so I believe 
<br/>everything proper has been done
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>This was my first illness 
<br/>since leaving England in /58
<br/>We dont know what it was 
<br/>Feet and knees swelled and 
<br/>were so painful for 2 days 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that I could not stand. An 
<br/>eruption came out, began 
<br/>with <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Kirk</span> and went over 
<br/>us all. Even Gorgon's people 
<br/>took it. I was down three days 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>but am now I am thankful 
<br/>to say quite free of the complaint
<br/>I say so much about myself 
<br/>because people at the Cape made 
<br/>me so ill when nothing was wrong 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>whatever</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have sent a pressing request to 
<br/><span class="">Admiral Walker</span> for provisions 
<br/>for we have not a fortnight's 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>food on board, and cannot buy 
<br/>any at this part nor indeed 
<br/>in any part where slavetrade 
<br/>has depopulated the country. 
<br/>I propose, if no vessel is to be 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>sent this way, that the <span class="">Admiral</span>
<br/>should freight a small one from 
<br/><span class="">Natal</span>. I ask 6 months stores
<br/>We have been disappointed 
<br/>in not <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span>quinine from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>you along with the other 
<br/>medicines &amp; ask 3lbs from the 
<br/><span class="">Admiral</span>. We need all this 
<br/>while giving it daily to all hands
<br/>We dont see a paddle wheel 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Boss ordered from <span class="">Penn</span> when 
<br/>the Pioneer was at the Cape. 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>It is much needed for the other side</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The reason why the Pioneer goes so 
<br/>slow with a load is said to be her 
<br/>engines were placed for 3 feet draught 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>and she never draws less than 4 1/2 
<br/>now with a load 5 - they would 
<br/>require to be lifted up a foot &amp; a half
<br/>We shall put the new steamer together 
<br/>at <span class="">Shupanga</span> and tow her up to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>the cataracts - I doubt <span class="">Hardistys</span> zeal.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">A gentleman has been sent out 
<br/>by the free church of Scotland to obtain 
<br/>information with a view to 
<br/>a mission on <span class="">Nyassa</span>. As this 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>will not interfere with the bishop, 
<br/>I invited him to come up and 
<br/>see the country and people for 
<br/>himself. His name is <span class="">Rev<span class="sup underline ">d</span>
<br/>James Stewart</span>. There is room 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>for all that in the region, and it is 
<br/>questionable whether the bishop 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>has not blocked up his own way 
<br/>Northwards by attacking the 
<br/>Ajawa, who now possess all 
<br/>the East bank of <span class="">Shire</span> from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the cataracts up to the Lake. 
<br/>His sister, <span class="underline ">a confirmed invalid</span>, 
<br/>came up to him. <span class="">Captain 
<br/>Wilson</span> seeing how slowly we 
<br/>got up - (3 weeks to <span class="">Shupanga</span>! 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Last year 2 days only!) acceded to 
<br/>her request to be taken with <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span>
<br/>Burrup</span> (another of the missionaries) 
<br/>forward to the <span class="">Ruo</span> in his gig. 
<br/>The bishop engaged to be there 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>but did not appear &amp; <span class="">Captain 
<br/>Wilson</span> pushed on to <span class="">Chibisa's</span>
<br/>the invalid being more dead 
<br/>than alive. We expect him 
<br/>daily on his return, and when 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>he does so I shall give you the 
<br/>latest intelligence.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I feel it rather too much to have to 
<br/>give passages to all the missionaries 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I was willing and anxious to 
<br/>do all I could for them &amp; am 
<br/>still willing, but it is a serious 
<br/>draw back to our own success. 
<br/><span class="">Rev M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Proctor</span> wanted to come down 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>for a wife, &amp; the bishop proposed 
<br/>to come too. I had to tell them 
<br/>that the Pioneer was not a 
<br/>passenger vessel. It is a serious 
<br/>tax on our stores. <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Stewart</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>offers payment for everything 
<br/>has calico to buy his own 
pro-<br/>visions and works at whatever 
<br/>he can do. Some of the bishop's 
<br/>people believe that they have a 

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>right to everything here, and on board 
<br/>the men of war which causes 
<br/>grumbling among the officers.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">You really had a serious task 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>imposed on  you. The only way 
<br/>my daughter could <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: conceive">concieve</span> of 
<br/>to keep her Mama at home 
<br/>was to threaten to write to you 
<br/>and ask you to lock her in a 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>room. She went the length of 
<br/>writing to her Mama &amp; telling her 
<br/>that she was thinking of doing 
<br/>it!</p>
<br/><p class="p ">10 March at <span class="">Shupanga</span> unloading.</p>

<br/>I anticipated in buying country

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>putting Lady Nyassa together - will tow 
<br/>her up to the cataracts &amp; there unscrew 
<br/>her - probably we shall have food 
<br/>before that from the Admiral - so no 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>uneasiness need be felt. There too 
<br/>we can get plenty of native meal 
<br/>goats fowls &amp;c.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I may have mentioned already 
<br/>that I offered the charge of the Pioneer
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Gedye</span></span> at <span class="">Johanna</span> - &amp; he refused 
<br/>it on the plea that he could not 
<br/>navigate. I offered to lay down 
<br/>his positions for him &amp; point out 
<br/>the course but he again refused 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to take charge = so the subordinate 
<br/>position he occupied was his own 
<br/>choice.</p>

<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I send up to <span class="">Tette</span> to bring our things

<br/>ammunition there. D. Livingstone</p>
