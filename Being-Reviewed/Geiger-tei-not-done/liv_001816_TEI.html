<br/>H.M.S. Ariel which called at 
<br/>Kongone. there were two for 
<br/>dear Mama besides, which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>had she been here would have 
<br/>made her glad. She is now 
<br/>with her Saviour and possibly 
<br/>knows what we are doing 
<br/>without the aid of letters. I 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>see that you remember the 
<br/>dates of the departure of the 
<br/>mails and have written 
<br/>monthly. We seldom get letters 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>or send them away for no 
<br/>monthly mail comes to our 
<br/>quarters but if you write 
<br/>as often as you can I shall 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>send you as much in 
<br/>return as all you write. I 
<br/>thank you for your kind 
<br/>birthday present and for all 
<br/>your good wishes. I have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>sent some little things in 
<br/>a box which will be opened 
<br/>by <span class="">Sir William Hooker</span> at 
<br/><span class="">Kew</span> and the packet sent 
<br/>to <span class="">Agnes</span>. you may consider 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>what is sent to you as your 
<br/>birthday present though I dont 
<br/>know when that is.</p>

<br/><p class="p ">We are now at sea in the 
<br/><span class="">Mosambique channel</span> going to 
<br/><span class="">Johanna</span> and the <span class="">River 
<br/>Rovuma</span>. We steamed off 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Kongone</span> to get away well from 
<br/>the land then our wood being 
<br/>but small we set sail, and 
<br/>kept the fuel for worse times 
<br/>but the wind was against 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>us or from the North East. 
<br/>If we went one way we 
<br/>should have gone into <span class="">Quillimane</span>
<br/>so we went the other and 
<br/>were fain to go away far to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the South East. When about 
<br/>mid channel we had a fine 
<br/>breeze from the south and 
<br/>went as we thought sixty miles 
<br/>to the North but next day we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>found by the sun &amp; chronometers 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>that while sailing briskly in one 
<br/>way the current in the sea had 
<br/>been taking us faster in another
<br/>We were twelve miles South West 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of where we had been the day 
<br/>before when the wind began to 
<br/>blow from the South. Indeed the 
<br/>current had been flowing at the rate 
<br/>of 72 miles a day. Last year 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>we met an East Indian ship 
<br/>near the same spot which was 
<br/>carried by the same current 
<br/>40 miles a day. We were then 
<br/>becalmed and knowing <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">that</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>though we could see nothing 
<br/>that we were still gliding away 
<br/>where we did not wish to go. 
<br/>We got up steam and steamed 
<br/>East till we knew we had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>crossed the current. We have 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>had a good deal of calms, and only 
<br/>when we got near the coast of 
<br/><span class="">Madagascar</span> did we meet favourable 
<br/>winds. if you look at the map 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>you may see a small island called 
<br/><span class="">Jaõ de Nova</span> we went between 
<br/>that and <span class="">Madagascar</span>. we saw 
<br/>neither the island nor <span class="">Madagascar</span>
<br/>but by sextant &amp; chronometers 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I guided our ship through that 
<br/>way to avoid the current further 
<br/>out. We went 120 miles yesterday 
<br/>and should we have wind 
<br/>will see <span class="">Johanna</span> tomorrow 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>afternoon. Now you see it is 
<br/>a good thing to possess knowledge
<br/>I never intended to navigate 
<br/>a ship but now that it has 
<br/>come in my way, I do it &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>am thankful that I picked up 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>when younger all the knowledge 
<br/>I could. You must do the same. 
<br/>It is easy to carry about with 
<br/>you though you may not use 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>it. I wished to give <span class="">Robert</span> a 
<br/>good education as the best legacy 
<br/>I could leave him. I know it 
<br/>would be useful - but he does 
<br/>not appreciate it. At present 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>when young, people will pay 
<br/>attention to him on my account, 
<br/>but when they see that he has 
<br/>nothing in him he will be 
<br/>despised, and will be fit only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to drive a "cuddy and a cart" with 
<br/>greens or clay pipes. I am sorry 
<br/>for it but the loss will be 
<br/>his. and it will be yours if 
<br/>you build yourself up on your 

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>connection with me and not 
<br/>your own attainments and 
<br/>energy. I shall try and give you 
<br/>a good education to fit you for 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>a life of usefulness in the 
<br/>service of God whether I am 
<br/>alive or not. but if you do 
<br/>not resolve to educate 
your-<br/>self, or do that which your 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>masters can only help you to 
<br/>do, money will not serve. 
<br/>Wherefore is there a price in the 
<br/>hand of a fool to get wisdom 
<br/>seeing he hath no heart to it, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>is I think one of Solomon's 
<br/>sayings. In English we say 
<br/>"One cannot make a silk 
<br/>purse out of a sow's ear" We 
<br/>cannot make a wise man out

<br/>they knew that without education 
<br/>- trained &amp; disciplined minds, even 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>their high position would not 
<br/>save them from contempt. I 
<br/>am glad you still wish to be a

<br/>the Highest had an only son and he 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>was a missionary from the 
<br/>realms of bliss to save a lost world. 
<br/>I am working and preparing the 
<br/>way for others who will enter into 
<br/>my labours when I am no more 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>here - - You ask if I enjoyed my
