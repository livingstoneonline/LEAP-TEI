<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Procter</span></p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p ">Yesterday evening 
<br/>we <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> the very sad 
<br/>intelligence of the loss of our 
<br/>good bishop with your 
<br/>note. It came upon us 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>like a bewildering 
<br/>thunderclap and we 
<br/>can scarcely realize it 
<br/>as a fact. But for 
<br/>the living we got to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>work and quickly unloaded 
<br/>all that remained in the 
<br/>ship of 35 tons which 
<br/>we brought up from 
<br/>the <span class="">Kongone</span> - came 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>over to <span class="">Vianna's</span> after 
<br/>dark and with <span class="">Captain 
<br/>Wilson</span> arranged that 
<br/>light canoes should go 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>up at once to you with 
<br/>what provisions we 
<br/>have belonging to the 
<br/>mission. We have one 
<br/>cask of brandy &amp; one of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>constantia - the latter 
<br/><span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Meller</span> thinks wanting 
<br/>about one gallon - in 
<br/>consequence of our being 
<br/>out of wine for quinine
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>We took <span class="">Miss Mackenzie</span>
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">rs</span> Burrup</span>, <span class="">Jessie 
<br/>Lennox </span>, Sarah and 
<br/>Blair on board on the 
<br/>6<span class="sup underline ">th</span> February - they brought 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>no provisions for their 
<br/>own use, and we shared 
<br/>with them- all we had till 
<br/>not an ounce of meat 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of any kind was left. 
<br/>All our wine &amp; some 
<br/>got from the Gorgon
<br/>expended. And all 
<br/>our flour D<span class="sup ">o</span> We had 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to buy beans and 
<br/>sheep, the latter at £1 
<br/>each. In these circumstances 
<br/>I thought that the bishop 
<br/>would not blame me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>if I took two boxes 
<br/>of flour and the wine 
<br/>which had begun to 
<br/>leak to continue the 
<br/>daily dose of quinine. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I hoped to get up more 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>from <span class="">Kongone</span> before we 
<br/>could communicate with 
<br/>you. I send the wine as 
<br/>it is - sugar - soap - and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>everything else selected by 
<br/><span class="">Miss Mackenzie</span> to go 
<br/>with her to her brother
<br/>We shall bring more in 
<br/>a week and despatch 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>them by <span class="">Vianna's</span>
<br/>canoes - <span class="">Blair</span> goes 
<br/>with this. <span class="">Rev<span class="sup underline ">d</span> Hawkins</span>
<br/>will go with the next. 
<br/>i.e. if he feels able for 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>the service. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Two mules came for the 
<br/>mission. the bishop did 
<br/>not want them &amp; told me 
<br/>to send them back. I take 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>them off your hands rather 
<br/>at the original price &amp; will 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>write to the bishop at the 
<br/><span class="">Cape</span> to that effect. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">We lent the bishop a 
<br/>bale of calico and repaid 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>ourselves by a bale 
<br/>which turned out to be 
<br/>"tents" or remnants of 
<br/>prints. We tried another 
<br/>and that was table linen 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>which we cannot sell 
<br/>we shall keep it for 
<br/>you loose as it is. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">We are just about 
<br/>to start for the sea. No 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>time will be lost in 
<br/>forwarding all we can
<br/>It is impossible for us 
<br/>to come. Excuse this 
<br/>hurried note<span class=""> D. Livingstone</span></p>
