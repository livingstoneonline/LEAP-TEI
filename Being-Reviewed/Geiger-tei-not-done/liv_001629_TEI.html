<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 2 words ">                </span>Very many 
<br/>and hearty thanks 
<br/>for your letter, and the 
<br/>packet of journals &amp;c 
<br/>which accompanied 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it. this is the first 
<br/>scrape of your pen 
<br/>I have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> since 
<br/>we came out and 
<br/>I confess that I was 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>beginning to be 
im-<br/>patient with my 
<br/>semper idem Friend

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>This however sets all 
<br/>to rights and I am 
<br/>quite thankful.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I cannot tell you much 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>about <span class="">Rovuma</span> yet 
<br/>as we are waiting for 
<br/>H.M.S Lyra which 
<br/>brings us some coals
<br/>We have no bar. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>And no bottom was 
<br/>found with seventeen 
<br/>fathoms across the 
<br/>mouth. An immense 
<br/>body of water rolls 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>out a mile broad. 
<br/>We went up some 
<br/>8 miles yesterday 
<br/>in a boat &amp; saw 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span> 
<br/>that it is evidently 
<br/>in flood. people 
<br/>speak same language 
<br/>as on <span class="">Zambesi</span> so 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>we shall get on. We 
<br/>are trying to get an 
<br/>entrance exterior to 
<br/>the Portuguese claims 
<br/>and are not permitted 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to say anything 
<br/>publicly, so this is 
<br/>all between ourselves. 
<br/>but by the way in 
<br/>three months we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>shall be able to give 
<br/>you a good deal of 
<br/>information about 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span> 
<br/>the <span class="">Rovuma</span>. At present 
<br/>we cannot get a syllable 
<br/>of information from 
<br/>any one but no sooner 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>do we publish than 
<br/><span class="">Macqueen</span> will start 
<br/>up and say he knew 
<br/>all about it. Why 
<br/>not tell you all 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>about it during the 
<br/>next three months 
<br/>or before we do?</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I am sure that the 
<br/>journal of <span class="">Silva Porto</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>is a literary fraud, 
<br/>for I met him at 
<br/>the time specified 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span> 
<br/>either 1853 or 4. I 
<br/>think the former but 
<br/>quote from memory 
<br/>alone. He then said 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>that he had tried to 
<br/>go East but failed 
<br/>after going to about 
<br/>the <span class="">Kafue</span>. He tried 
<br/>to send a party of his 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>people too but, <span class="add  below">^</span> <span class="add  above">they</span> failed 
<br/>and he got to the 
<br/>West before I did 
<br/>and his journal 
<br/>was published while 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>I was at <span class="">Loanda</span>. 
<br/>His meeting with 
<br/>me mentioned 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span> 
<br/>and <span class="underline ">not a word 
<br/>about having gone 
<br/>to the East Coast</span>!! </p>
