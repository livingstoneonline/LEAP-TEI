<br/><p class="p noindent">We are waiting here for our new steamer
<br/>and for the first time since my return to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Africa</span> I have <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: leisure">leizure</span> for correspondence 
<br/>We cannot divine what detains her 
<br/>as she is now two months beyond her 
<br/>time - but patience patience!</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have heard from <span class="">Sir Culling 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>E. <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Eardley">Earldley</span></span></span> and he refers to a Karross
<br/>you gave to <span class="">Lady <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Eardley">Earldley</span></span></span>. She 
<br/>told me about the loss she sustained 
<br/>by going to the <span class="">Continent</span>. When she 
<br/>returned it was all moth eaten. She 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>was "so sorry as it came from 
<br/>you" I mentioned it to you at the 
<br/><span class="">Cape</span> but it must have escaped 
<br/>your memory - or possibly I neglected 
<br/>to give you their address. It is 39 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>Upper Grosvenor St.<span class="">London</span>.</p>
<br/>
<br/><p class="p noindent">we have got from them has been of first rate quality. We shall 
<br/>try to get an entrance <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">exterior</span> to the Portuguese claims but 
<br/>this is not made public</p>

<br/><p class="p noindent">If it were possible for me to buy one 
<br/>in this region I would do so but none 
<br/>are to be had for love or money. She has 
<br/>been suffering greatly from disease of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the heart. This brings to my recollection 
<br/>that we got a glimpse of some people from 
<br/><span class="">Mosilikatze's</span> at <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sena">Senna</span></span>. As soon as they 
<br/>saw the Makololo with me they decamped 
<br/>and no persuasion could induce them 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to come near us. A <span class="">Senhor Isidore 
<br/><span class="">Pereira</span></span> of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sena">Senna</span></span> usually called <span class="">Senhor 
<br/><span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Eezedor</span></span></span> sent a party of his slaves to trade 
<br/>with <span class="">Mosilikatze</span> 16 months ago. they 
<br/>were away 14 months but stopped at 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>different places for months at a time 
<br/>This is the second visit and the guns you saw 
<br/>came from <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sena">Senna</span></span>. <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Mosilikatze</span>
<br/>sent about 30 head of cattle, one a 
<br/>remarkable pure white ox. Of these only 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>2 arrived and one died while we were at 
<br/><span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sena">Senna</span></span>. About 1000 sheep &amp; goats. Of these 
<br/>about <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">400</span> arrived &amp; nearly all lame. 
<br/>and 2 meercat karrosses.!</p>
<br/>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><p class="p noindent">The word "Falla" means to speak and it is probably the only word they 
<br/>had picked up. <span class="">Isidore</span> is commandant of <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sena">Senna</span></span></p>

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/><p class="p noindent"><span class="">Isidore</span> was not well pleased with the trade 
<br/>and we heard him threatening to send his 
<br/>slaves to the fort for punishment but being 
<br/>a rather dissatisfied character we dont 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>know whether this means much. He 
<br/>lost all his ostrich feathers by the camp 
<br/>taking <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: high">fire. Laws</span> very stringent against 
<br/>gunpowder &amp; arms being sold to the natives 
<br/>but nobody observes them - not one. These 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>people never went near you - they were 
<br/>afraid. They lived with a headman of 
<br/><span class="">Mosilikatzes</span> at some distance from <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Moshetta</span></span>
<br/>They saw a hunter kill an elephant. Was 
<br/>this <span class="">Baldwin</span>? A chief of the Batoka
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>called <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Sekote</span></span> fled from <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Kalai is<span class="sup underline ">d</span></span> to 
<br/><span class="">Mosilikatze</span> and lives under him. The 
<br/>people who have come to <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Sena">Senna</span></span> belong 
<br/>to his party and it so happened that we 
<br/>have a man of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Sekote</span></span> who came with us 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>to get himself cured of leprosy. He knew 
<br/>the strangers by name but like unmitigated 
<br/>cowards they fled, though the few Makololo
<br/>had no spears - nor would they return when</p>

<br/><p class="p noindent">their own countryman went &amp; tried to persuade 
<br/>them. This proves the truth of what I have 
<br/>told the Makololo that they are just a lot of 
<br/>hyaenas - cowards before all who are stronger 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>than they are - they dread the Matibele and I 
<br/>suspect are dreaded by them. The account given 
<br/>you of a fight below the <span class="">Falls</span> in which the 
<br/>Matibele were victorious does not appear to 
<br/>have taken place at all. A foray was made 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to the West but the leprosy affair came on 
<br/>afterwards and embittered their success. If 
<br/>they cannot remove soon fever will break 
<br/>them up as a tribe. It is a pity that <span class="">John</span>
<br/>did not go there but <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">not</span> by <span class="">Linyanti</span>

<br/>are then avoided and one is at the foot 
<br/>of the highlands. I cannot imagine what kept 
<br/><span class="">Helmore</span> so long in the way. Did they use 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>any remedy? Was it fever? What symptoms 
<br/>did they observe? are questions I should like 
<br/>to put but cannot.</p>
