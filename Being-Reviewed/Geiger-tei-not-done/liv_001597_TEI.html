<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear <span class="">Moore</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space" title="space: 3 words ">                        </span>And why didn't you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>begin when you were so often on the 
<br/>point of writing but didn't? This 
<br/>that you have accomplished is so 
<br/>far good but very short. Hope you 
<br/>are not yet too old to learn. You 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>have heard of our hindrances and 
<br/>annoyances and possibly that 
<br/>we have done some work notwith
<br/>standing. It was galling to find that 
<br/>our "sickly sheep" was what may 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>termed an Evangelical of the 
<br/>ultra or mad school that believes 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>in the literal interpretations of everything 
<br/>in the Bible and that table turning is 
<br/>effected by Satan turning <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: showman">shewman</span>
<br/>at the bidding of any ass who has nothing 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>else to do - but thanks to Providence 
<br/>we have made some progress and it 
<br/>is likely our operations will yet have 
<br/>a decided effect on slave trading in 
<br/>Eastern Africa. I am greatly delighted 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>with the prospect of a church of 
<br/>England mission to Central Africa 
<br/>that is a good omen for those 
<br/>who are sitting in darkness and I 
<br/>trust that in process of time great 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>benefits will be conferred on our 
<br/>own overcrowded population at 
<br/>home. there is room enough and 
<br/>to spare in the fair world our Father 
<br/>has prepared for all his progeny 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I pray to be made a harbinger of

<br/>good to many both white and black</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I like to hear that some abuse me 
<br/>now and say that I am no Christian
<br/>Many good things were said of me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>which I did not deserve and I feared 
<br/>to read them. I shall read every word 
<br/>I can on the other side and that 
<br/>will prove a sedative to what I was 
<br/>forced to hear of an opposite tendency. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>I pray that He who has lifted me 
<br/>up and guided me thus far will 
<br/>not desert me now but make 
<br/>me useful in my day &amp; generation 
<br/>"I will never leave thee nor forsake 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>thee" So let it be</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I have felt no regret at leaving 
<br/>the association to which you refer 
<br/>but felt a pang in prospect of parting 
<br/>with the sympathies of so many who 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>would be <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">led</span> to consider me as parted

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span> 
<br/>being free from the Executive whose 
<br/>nature you understand, and Please 
<br/>God I shall be more useful than 
<br/>could have been under them. I saw 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>poor <span class="">Helmores</span> grave lately. Had my book 
<br/>been searched for <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">excellencies</span> they might 
<br/>have seen a certain cure for African Fever
<br/>We were curing it at a lower &amp; worse 
<br/>part of the river at the very time that they 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>were helplessly perishing and so quickly 
<br/>more than a day was never lost after 
<br/>the operation of that remedy though we were 
<br/>marching on foot. Our tramp was 
<br/>over 600 miles - We dropped downstream

<br/>to meet our new steamer Our old
