<br/>being then in the hurry of packing &amp; loading I only looked to see who
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>was debtor &amp; who creditor. After returning from the Wanketse
<br/>I looked over the whole and as you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> claim perfection
<br/>you will not be surprised though in my queries &amp;c I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>

<br/><span class="">Mr Helmore</span> by a man whose name nearly blotted out seems
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>to be <span class="">Mokitlan</span> - Have you any recollection as to what this
<br/>money was sent for - or if any other money was sent 
<br/>at  same time - I have a distinct recollection of having paid
<br/>off the money sent by <span class="">Mebaloe</span> viz 24 dollars &amp; writing a    
<br/>note to <span class="">Mr Helmore</span> to use his influence with <span class="">Moyahe</span> to furnish

<br/>see him will you be kind enough to ask him about it
<br/>Have you any note of the 12/ perhaps <span class="">Mebaloe</span>'s was sent at

<br/>that of <span class="">Mebaloe</span> viz. 24 dollars.</p>

<br/>was not paid for. I have three pairs of tongs - One I took with
<br/>me from <span class="">Mabotsa</span> because I had been at all the trouble
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of carrying bellows &amp;c. in and I had not a single pair - The
<br/>other pair are those charged in the account and the third
    
       

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span>
<br/>a small pair I am not sure whether I got them from you or from

<br/>as much in <span class="">her will</span> for me. I make it over to you in
<br/>order to get free, even if it is £100 I shall give it you
<br/>for the £30. I wish you would take a peep into the
<br/>document &amp; see how much I am to get - and when we
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>have made the arrangement I shall no longer be wishing
<br/>that she may cut her stick. <span class="">Mary</span> will tell you that
<br/>we shall need tea coffee &amp; rice should you be sending to
<br/><span class="">Colesberg</span>. I mentioned glass and may add soap. But we
<br/>shall not probably need anything else. except <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: heifers">hiefers</span> and
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>I feel very unwilling to buy anything except what is
<br/>absolutely necessary till I get out of debt- I would send
<br/>for a pair of ploughs from <span class="">Wilkie</span> but for it - Extra

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>the ploughs used in <span class="">Scotland</span> have no wheels but are all iron
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> wants one- Do you think it would be will to order

<br/>£4.15 will do for this country - Or if <span class="add  above">of</span> extra strength where
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>ought the extra strength to be put - I feel at a loss on this
<br/>point - My father lives near to <span class="">Wilkie</span> &amp; purposes to get one
<br/>for us ― Although in debt I feel strongly inclined to
<br/>order one for £6 If you are sending money to <span class="">England</span>
<br/>this year can you let me have so much of it, 5/ goes

<br/><p class="p ">I never made any remarks on <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span> Elliot</span>s letter because
<br/>I was quite ignorant of the matter. A circular sent some
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>time before about the reduction of the sum expended on <span class="">Africa</span>
<br/>with the request to hear our opinion on the subject induced
<br/>me to tell them what I had seen - in <span class="">Algoa Bay</span>, &amp;c.
<br/>and I expressed the opinion that the colony was no longer
<br/>a missionary field - and the sum proposed was quite
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>enough if missionaries now in the colony would only
<br/>come on to the regions which could still claim the
<br/>help of <span class="">missionary societies</span> - I compared the supplies
<br/>of <span class="">Algoa Bay</span> - <span class="">Uitenhage</span> - <span class="">Graaf Reinet</span> <span class="">Colesberg</span> with
<br/>certain villages at home, and felt quite certain those
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>at home had not ⅓ of the supply. I could not speak of
<br/>other places. It is well you did what you have done

<br/>the arrangement with the <span class="add  inline">˄</span> <span class="add  above">small</span> rifle cannot be made. I had
<br/>written you twice &amp; <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: received">recieved</span> no answer about the ivory. The
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>letter in which you desired me to sell it came a little too late
<br/>and I wished to get your property out of the way of the
<br/><span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span>. We thought then they might be wicked enough
<br/>to come</p>
<br/><p class="p ">The note which puzzled the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> brains was written
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>by me. on the morning they came - that being the same morning
<br/>that we heard of the sad circumstance mentioned in my
<br/>last - I asked <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above"><span class="">Sechele</span></span> himself if the report of his connection
<br/>with the woman were true as the people were talking of it
<br/>he replied by saying I shall ask her and sent his uncle
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>to her. She refused at first to tell but at last said
<br/>that he had himself been to her twice on the occasion of this
<br/>visit of <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">Sentuke</span></span> - She sent his uncle to tell me the whole
<br/>&amp; said he had fallen by the temptation of Satan. He could not
<br/>deny it that he had gone on that occasion and did not
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>wish as he was conscious of guilt to press her to tell
<br/>of any one else - the law being in that case death - Do
<br/>not give me up because of this - I shall never give up <span class="">Jesus</span>
<br/>you &amp; I will stand before him together &amp;c. The conclusion
<br/>to which I came immediately was he has apostatized
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>and if he has become our enemy I may as well leave
    
       

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>2<span class="sup ">d</span> sheet
<br/>and try some other tribe. <span class="">Mary</span> said - Let us both go now - I answered
<br/>him by saying that the blame must not be put on Satan - He had
<br/>done it of his own free will and since he had of his own
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>free will forsaken the laws of <span class="">Christ</span>. Why not tell it at the time
<br/>and not continue to appear as one of his people when in his
<br/>heart he knew he was serving another. About <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">two</span> <span class="add  above">one</span> hour<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">s</span>
<br/>after that the <span class="">Boers</span> came and the same man was sent down
<br/>to request me to write a note to them to the effect that though
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>he did not come to see them he thanked them for their message
<br/>that morning. (They had sent a message in the morning before they
<br/>came about their object in coming) The man came to me
<br/>and said he is thankful for the message <span class="add  below">˄</span> <span class="add  above">you sent</span> and wishes you
<br/>to write it out for him — I wrote a few sentences in
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Sitchuana similar to the above answer, and to the best  
<br/>of my recollection they might be thus "You have not sinned
<br/>against me but against <span class="">Jesus</span>. You must not blame
<br/>Satan for you have broke the laws of Jesus of your
<br/>own accord. And you ought to have told me when you
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>did so or when you concluded to obey him no longer
<br/>My heart is broken, first <span class="">Isack</span> - then you - I can
<br/>no longer be a teacher here." without opening it he
<br/>sent it to the <span class="">Boers</span> - <span class="">Sechele</span> never dreamed it was
<br/>for him - For when I asked him after reading yours
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>what he had done with the note I had written on the morning
<br/>the <span class=""><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Boers">boers</span></span> came he instantly replied I sent it over to them
<br/>they were on the other side of the <span class="">Kolobeng</span> - I <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span>

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span>
<br/>wonder <span class="">Edwards</span> was required to make it out - My heart was
<br/>full of conflicting emotions but not of the sort he conjectured
<br/>Our connection with him is of a very different sort from
<br/>that which existed between <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Mosielele</span></span> &amp; us or that which
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>prevails there now. We have no contention or wrangling
<br/>or <span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: low">petting</span>. He never attempted to justify himself in sin Nor
<br/>would he care although <span class="">Isaac</span> were in Davy Jones locker
<br/>He used to coax <span class="">Isaac</span> to read with him by giving him food
<br/>but the gentleman interfered disagreeably between <span class="">Paul</span> &amp; him (<span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">I</span>)
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and his conduct generally has made him anything but
<br/>liked among the people — <span class="">Sechele</span> is suspended of course
<br/>from fellowship and will be so even though he should
<br/>walk with propriety till a considerable time after the woman
<br/>brings forth - - That which made me believe his professions
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>of sorrow were sincere was he never in the least swerved
<br/>in his conduct towards us, nor yet in his general deport-
<br/>-ment. When we thought that it was all over with us
<br/>here we thought he had apostatized completely and as such
<br/>usually do would become our enemy &amp; fight against us. And
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>as we have nothing here apart from working for <span class="">Jesus</span>'
<br/>cause it would be folly to remain with our hands bound
<br/>Even now I think that a few months absence from 
<br/>them occasionally will be beneficial. Hunger is very
<br/>great &amp; all the attention is taken up in caring for the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>body. School is very thin &amp; so is the church generally
<br/>Now we have neither printing nor translating
    
       

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span>
<br/>I could work at other things but whatever they might be it
<br/>would not be Missionary work. It would be merely passing the
<br/>time, so I begin to think if another station were in existence
<br/>on which to spend a part of the year - it might tend to
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the furtherance of the <span class="">gospel</span>. Here we have tried every mode 
<br/>of illustration I could think of. But though sometimes we
<br/>see symptoms which encourage I feel afraid they may
<br/>look upon the whole affair as one which will always
<br/>be carried on here whether they heed it or not. <span class="">Sebitoane</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>a chief a little north of the Lake is called a Letibele but seems
<br/>to speak somewhat like the Bamapela - He has a large
<br/>tribe &amp; is enlarging it still more by killing neighbouring
<br/>chieftains &amp; occupying their places among their people - He
<br/>lifted the Bakwain cattle - not <span class="">Mosilikatse</span> .- but before
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>surrounding the town he gave orders to his people, to spare
<br/>the children of <span class="">Mocoasele</span> - <span class="">Sechele</span>'s father who was then
<br/>dead. <span class="">Sechele</span> had been knocked down by a molamu but
<br/>not speared. When they saw him in the morning they
<br/>took him to <span class="">Sebitoane</span> - Who thanked them for sparing
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>him - Taking him with him to the Bamangwato, the 
<br/>then chief <span class="">Kame</span> offered to redeem <span class="">Sechele</span> with a large
<br/>bag of beads he had purchased from the Malokane - <span class="">Sebitoane</span>
<br/>asked <span class="">Sechele</span> if he was quite willing to go with him. If he was
<br/>he would treat him as his son &amp;c. but if not he would 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>allow him to go. <span class="">Sechele</span>'s mother was foot sore so
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span> said to him you see my mother is unable to 
<br/>go any farther and though you offer to treat me kindly
<br/>in your country I should like to live in my own land
    
       

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span>
<br/>Let me save my mother &amp; return I shall consider that kindness
<br/>enough. <span class="">Sebitoane</span> said very well since you <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: don't">dont</span> like to come
<br/>to me, take these nine head of cattle &amp; return — He has one of
<br/><span class="">Sechele</span>'s brothers with him now &amp; often asks for <span class="">Sechele</span> and
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the latter feels very anxious to visit his former benefactor.
<br/>When we go he sends a present to him by us. Seven men
<br/>have come from the Lake inviting us to come. We may
<br/>find an open door there though the Eastern door seems shut
<br/>Am glad <span class="">Robert</span> seems to give himself so heartily to the cause
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of <span class="">Christ</span> &amp; humanity. Thats the thing - the day is coming

<br/>but you seem to prefer the <span class="">Mail</span> - At first I thought of 
<br/>sending my views to <span class="">Robert</span> but after giving him a
<br/>screed I came to the conclusion that a bit written with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>more care would suit the purpose better and the sooner
<br/>it goes to the public the better for the subject will lose

<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I did not furnish about the affair here - of which you have

<br/>and almost prayed may he never return - <span class=""><span class="unclear" title="unclear, certainty of reading: medium">Hesse</span></span> came up

<br/>again if I did not go it would not look kind to <span class="">Paul</span>
<br/>so down I went &amp; proposed as she wished to go to Hell
<br/>that she should come near &amp; put her hand in the fire for
<br/>a while to try how she liked it. This made her quiet
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and she afterwards denied having sought a knife</p>
<br/><p class="p ">I should not put in another word merely because the
<br/>one used was like another word of an obscene meaning but I

<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>a point of very little importance for only those who are lightly disposed
<br/>will in reading the words of God mistake their meaning. these
<br/>two words occurred to be remarked on in my presence but that
<br/>was among pure <span class="">heathen</span> - happening to hear them remarked on
<br/>was the reason I thought they ought to be mentioned to you but
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>this may never happen again. My attention was called to
<br/>lōpa in the same way but we have no word to substitute
<br/>for lopa and it is not so like as the others - hetola to dye
