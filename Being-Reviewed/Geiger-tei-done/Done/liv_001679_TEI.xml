<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My Dear <persName>Tom</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I often think that one 
<lb/>of the greatest blessings God bestowed 
<lb/>on me was birth in a Christian land 
<lb/>of Christian parents and among those 
<lb/>who loved the Lord Jesus. I feel how 
<lb/>great was the benefit bestowed when 
<lb/>I see human bones bleaching on the 
<lb/>shores of this Lake or have the sense of 
<lb/>smell offended by coming near human 
<lb/>bodies rotting on the beach. The children 
<lb/>are except in colour, just like children 
<lb/>at home - the same merry shouts at 
<lb/>play - the same tones of voice in 
<lb/>weeping, but here no church going bell is 
<lb/>ever heard - no school has ever been 
<lb/>erected to teach either young or old. 
<lb/>Slaving goes on whenever a slave 
<lb/>buyer comes - the people offer children 
<lb/>to us - We seem in the kingdom of 
<lb/>darkness where men are without 
<lb/>natural affection. but this state is 
<lb/>largely indebted to <unclear cert="low">war tormented</unclear>
<lb/>either by slave traders or by native 
<lb/>conquerors. the majority of the people 
<lb/>flee before invaders and as we <unclear cert="low">saw</unclear>
<lb/>down the <placeName>Shire</placeName> place a river between 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001679_0002"/><!--pb/@n='114v'--> 
<lb/>them and their enemies. Then comes 
<lb/>starvation for the food is all left behind 
<lb/>the parents have often to part with 
<lb/>the children for food or the parents die 
<lb/>and the children are left desolate - 
<lb/>the headmen sell them - We came into a 
<lb/>village surrounded by beautiful shady 
<lb/>trees &amp; stopped under them to breakfast 
<lb/>a sadly emaciated child was sitting picking 
<lb/>up grains of corn &amp; eating them. but 
<lb/>thinking that we were the slavehunters 
<lb/>from whom it had escaped across the 
<lb/>river it made off crying though so weak it 
<lb/>could only crawl on hands &amp; knees. 
<lb/>I took some of our breakfast to give 
<lb/>it but it had secreted itself among the 
<lb/>long grass &amp; could not be found - Many 
<lb/>hundreds will perish in consequence 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> invasion. which <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term>
<lb/>are only a small body of 60 or so robbers 
<lb/>and murderers urged on by Portuguese 
<lb/>They kill all the able bodied men of a 
<lb/>village and sell the women &amp; children 
<lb/>for about three yards of calico worth 
<lb/>eighteen pence. If you knew how 
<lb/>sad this fair portion of the world is by 
<lb/>the wickedness of those who dwell in 
<lb/><choice><sic>in</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> it you would pray heartily 
<lb/>"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be 
<lb/>done in earth as it is in heaven.

<lb/><!-- Hand 02 115 top right-->We hope to place a steamer on this 
<lb/>Lake and this would do little without 
<lb/>a Mission. The Free Church of 
<lb/>Scotland proposes to send one, and I 
<lb/>rejoice to hear of it - We have been looking 
<lb/>at many places for a suitable locality 
<lb/>and At <placeName>Makuza</placeName> with a chief called 
<lb/><persName>Marenga</persName> we think they might be 
<lb/>comfortable. We have always to 
<lb/>think of the healthiness of the place 
<lb/>first and curiously enough the 
<lb/>presence or absence of Mosquitoes 
<lb/>assists us in forming our judgement 
<lb/>A great many of these troublesome 
<lb/>insects <unclear cert="high">shews</unclear> where much <term type="ailment">fever</term>
<lb/>may be expected - The missionaries 
<lb/>will require a steamer and it is well 
<lb/>that they have many good friends 
<lb/>in Glasgow who would gladly 
<lb/>help them to one. We expect to have 
<lb/>one capable of being unscrewed at the 
<lb/>bottom of the cataracts and carried past 
<lb/>in pieces. Were it on the Lake now 
<lb/>we could save hundreds of lives 
<lb/>by buying food at one part of the 
<lb/>Lake where it is cheap and giving 
<lb/>it to the perishing. they would not 
<lb/>know our motives but in time they

<lb/><choice><sic>they</sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> would discover that the love of christ 
<lb/><unclear cert="high">constraineth</unclear> us. We have had the honour 
<lb/>to lead the mission of the English 
<lb/>Universities up to the <placeName>Mang-anja high-
<lb break="no"/>-lands</placeName>. they settled on a nice spot by a 
<lb/>stream about the size of the <placeName>Calder at the 
<lb/>Prior's bridge</placeName>. It forms a bend thus

<lb/>live. the water was quite too cold to 
<lb/>bathe in when I was there. they are 
<lb/>about 3000 ft above the sea. and lofty 
<lb/>mountains rise East of them with the 
<lb/>tail of <placeName>Lake Shirwa</placeName> at their base. We 
<lb/>went to speak with the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> robbers 
<lb/>from whom all the people were fleeing 
<lb/>and nearly lost our lives by some 
<lb/>people with us calling out "Here is our

<lb/>soon have made an end of us all 
<lb/>We were by this foolish cry deprived of 
<lb/>the shield of our good name and all 
<lb/>we could say in explanation was 
<lb/>looked on as an evidence of fear, but 
<lb/>God protected us and the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> have 
<lb/>left <unclear cert="medium">that</unclear> part of the country. I fear that 
<lb/>you will find my writing difficult as I 
<lb/>have to write with the paper on my knee 
<lb/>God bless you and save you</p>
