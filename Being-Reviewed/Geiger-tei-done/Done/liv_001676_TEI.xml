<lb/><p rend="no-indent">We who were up on the Highlands 
<lb/>found all the people fleeing from the 
<lb/>Ajawa and it was clear that if they 
<lb/>were not induced to desist the bishop 
<lb/>would soon have the country to 
<lb/>himself. We therefore went to the 
<lb/>vicinity of <placeName>Mount Zomba</placeName> to hold a 
<lb/>parley with the marauders. We came 
<lb/>upon them when in the act of burning 
<lb/>three villages. Here the bishop offered 
<lb/>up a fervent prayer. The Ajawa had 
<lb/>a long line of captives laden with 
<lb/>plunder and we could hear the wail 
<lb/>for the dead mingling with the shouts 
<lb/>of welcome to the victors. The Ajawa 
<lb/>asked if we came peaceably &amp; though 
<lb/>we assured them that we did they seemed 
<lb/>to look upon us - A party of about 20 - 
<lb/>as such an easy prey that they began 
<lb/>notwithstanding, to shoot us with their 
<lb/>poisoned arrows - this probably arose 
<lb/>from some Manganja who followed 
<lb/>us calling out to them "Chibisa is 
<lb/>come." Chibisa is one of their great 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001676_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'-->
<lb/>generals and is believed to ensure victory 
<lb/>by his medicines. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his deprived us 
<lb/>of the benefit of our English name - 
<lb/>such has been the effect of the English 
<lb/>cruizers and <persName>Lord Palmerston's</persName> entire 
<lb/>slave trade policy that wherever known 
<lb/>the English name is highly respected. 
<lb/>An Arab Dhow, for instance, which 
<lb/>was purchasing slaves &amp; ivory about 
<lb/>twenty miles south of this and we are 
<lb/>now 120 miles up the Lake, fled 
<lb/>as soon as they heard that three English 
<lb/>men were coming up. Elated as the 
<lb/>Ajawa were with their victories, 
<lb/>they only interpreted our assurances 
<lb/>and <add place="above">our</add> slowly retiring from their village 
<lb/>as evidences if fear, rushed at 
<lb/>and surrounded us. Poisoned arrows 
<lb/>shot at 50 yards distance are no 
<lb/>joke, so we were obliged to drive 
<lb/>them away with our arms. When 
<lb/>they saw how far our rifles carried 
<lb/>they never came near again but 
<lb/>left that part of the country. </p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">The bishop will now follow his work 
<lb/>in peace, that is, if the Portuguese will 
<lb/>allow him. It is believed that the 
<lb/><choice><sic>gaurdianship</sic><corr>guardianship</corr></choice> of the coast from 
<lb/><placeName>Cape Delgado</placeName> to <placeName>Delagoa Bay</placeName> was 
<lb/>given to them for the especial purpose 
<lb/>of suppressing the slave trade - they 
<lb/>have virtually converted it into 
<lb/>a private slave preserve for the 
<lb/><choice><sic/><corr>no text</corr></choice>the benefit of the favourites of the 
<lb/>Govt. of <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>. I am very unwilling 
<lb/>to believe this of them, but I must 
<lb/>at last confess it to be the case. <persName>Major 
<lb/>Secard</persName> was removed from <placeName>Tette</placeName> 
<lb/>because he favoured us, and much 
<lb/>against his will made Governor 
<lb/>of <placeName>Iboe</placeName> "<hi rend="underline">interiors</hi>" i.e. in the mean 
<lb/>time, till another comes out. It thus 
<lb/>came to him in a way he could not 
<lb/>refuse but complained loudly at 
<lb/><placeName>Mosambique</placeName> that it placed him 
<lb/>in a false position for there is no 
<lb/>trade at <placeName>Iboe</placeName> to speak of but <add place="above">in</add> slaves<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001676_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>He was thus almost compelled to 
<lb/>become a slave trader. The Governor G.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>
<lb/>of <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> has gone into <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice>
<lb/>all the emoluments of slave trading. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>Governor of Quillimane has given his 
<lb/>daughter to a Senhor Cruz the principal 
<lb/><add place="above">slave</add> trader of this quarter, and he of <placeName>Tette</placeName> had 
<lb/>slaves up at <placeName>Zomba</placeName> purchasing the 
<lb/>Ajawa captives. The salaries of all 
<lb/>these Governors are small - the court 
<lb/>of <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> knows them to be so yet 
<lb/>the appointments are well known 
<lb/>to be conferred as favours. In fact 
<lb/>the profits arising from conniving 
<lb/>at the slave trade are the emoluments 
<lb/>which the Portuguese Government 
<lb/>confers on its officers. The province 
<lb/>costs the mother country about Â£5000 
<lb/>annually, and no trade is carried on 
<lb/>between East Africa and Portugal. 
<lb/>Why they should persist in keeping 
<lb/>all other nations out I cannot divine 
<lb/>for the few traders they have are 
<lb/>either half castes - convicts or the 
<lb/>officers of convict soldiers. I am 
<lb/>unwilling to believe that <persName>Don Pedro</persName>
<lb/>knows anything about it. He wished 
<lb/>to colonize and some soldiers were last 
<lb/>year sent out as colonists. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Governor 
<lb/>of <placeName>Tette</placeName> told me that the whole thing was a 
<lb/>gross imposition on his Majesty for though 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001676_0005"/><!--pb/@n='5'-->
<lb/>agricultural implements had also been 
<lb/>sent the soldiers knew nothing except 
<lb/>cleaning their <choice><sic>acoutrements</sic><corr>accoutrements</corr></choice>. For his 
<lb/>majesty's own sake the way should 
<lb/>be opened for other nations for then 
<lb/>alone will it be known that he is 
<lb/>not to blame. The presence of others 
<lb/>would undoubtedly be most beneficial 
<lb/>to the Portuguese settlements in the way 
<lb/>of stimulating their industry. If we 
<lb/>exclude ivory and slaves there is 
<lb/>more <del type="strikethrough">trade</del> <add place="above">produce</add> carried out in one year - 
<lb/>from <placeName>Natal</placeName> than has been during the 
<lb/>last hundred from the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. 
<lb/>Whatever you can do in the way of 
<lb/>inducing the Portuguese to abandon 
<lb/>their exclusive policy will be so 
<lb/>much gain to the cause of humanity 
<lb/>and progress. </p>
<lb/><p>We carried a boat past thirty five 
<lb/>miles of cataracts and then sailed
<lb/>her up. In no part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> have we 
<lb/>seen such a teeming population as 
<lb/>on the shores of this Lake. It may be 
<lb/>because this is the fishing season 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001676_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'-->
<lb/>but the shores seem covered with people. 
<lb/>Slaves<reg>,</reg> ivory and cotton are offered for 
<lb/>sale. We can only promise that a large 
<lb/>ship will soon come and buy all the 
<lb/>latter two articles. If we may judge 
<lb/>from the amount of cotton we buy 
<lb/>at the ship from a small portion 
<lb/>of the river Shire, and that too not in 
<lb/>the cotton season, the supply to be obtained 
<lb/>here will be very considerable. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>Lake is deep - we got no bottom with 
<lb/>our sounding line at 35 fathoms say 
<lb/>200 feet. It has no current in it. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here are four crossing places on it. 
<lb/><choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd the canoes which go at a good 
<lb/>rate cross over at one place in six 
<lb/>hours - in another in twelve, and 
<lb/>in some parts they do not cross at 
<lb/>all - though even there we can see 
<lb/>the tops of the mountains. We shall 
<lb/>measure it but it may be said to 
<lb/>be from 30 to 50 miles broad. It has 
<lb/>a long coast line from numerous 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001676_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'-->
<lb/>bays, and is surrounded, as far as 
<lb/>we have yet been, by mountains. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>people we called Marimba. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>are civil. The lake rises during the 
<lb/>rainy season about 3 feet - the waves 
<lb/>and rollers, which are very formidable, 
<lb/>go up to four feet. In Average years 
<lb/>the Shire rises about the same height, 
<lb/>and never falls much - but this 
<lb/>last was an extraordinary year &amp; 
<lb/>it left marks 12 feet above ordinary 
<lb/>levels. At the upper part of the Elephant 
<lb/>marsh the Shire branches out so that 
<lb/>we could not get five feet for the 
<lb/>Pioneer below that it is all deep &amp; 
<lb/>above the cataracts it is all deep - 
<lb/>again into the Lake, when it shelves off 
<lb/>8, 10, 12<reg>,</reg> 14 &amp;c fathoms - if we get 
<lb/>calmer weather we shall measure 
<lb/>the depth better (no bottom at 100 fathoms)<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hanks for your friend <placeName>Blakesley's</placeName>
<lb/>criticisms. I think that he has missed 
<lb/>my weak point. It is not the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001676_0008"/><!--pb/@n='8'-->
<lb/>for a <choice><sic>Mississipi</sic><corr>Mississippi</corr></choice> steamer could 
<lb/>ply on it the whole of ordinary years, 
<lb/>and eight months of the drier ones. 
<lb/>Any amount of coal too could be 
<lb/>obtained and <add place="above">a</add> Lignum vitae &amp; ebony 
<lb/>trade be at once established. My weak 
<lb/>point lies in the presence of the Portuguese 
<lb/>penal settlements; and the Portuguese Governors 
<lb/>ready to sell their grandmothers for gain. 
<lb/>If however in the quiet of his <choice><sic>incumbering</sic><corr>encumbering</corr></choice>
<lb/>he will concoct a better plan than either 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Barth's</persName> or mine, and then come 
<lb/>out to help to put it into execution 
<lb/>I promise him as good elephant &amp; 
<lb/>hippopotami shooting as is to be found 
<lb/>in <placeName>Africa</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he people have few or no 
<lb/>guns and the animals are not afraid of 
<lb/>the bow and arrow - If he will not 
<lb/>accede to these terms I need not try him 
<lb/>with a fish which seems to possess 
<lb/>some of the shape and habits of our salmon 
<lb/>but be contended with and thankful 
<lb/>for any more criticisms you may supply. </p>
<lb/><p>I am anxiously expecting a steamer 
<lb/>for this Lake - she must be a strong 
<lb/>one. Ma Robert would have floundered 
<lb/>here in the first storm. I think it may be 
<lb/>best to go on establishing ourselves 
<lb/>without heeding the Portuguese at 
<lb/>home - if they plunder my goods at 
<lb/><placeName>Tette</placeName> I shall say little - please remember 
<lb/>me to your brother <persName>Captain Denman</persName>
<lb/>&amp; believe me yours &amp;c <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
