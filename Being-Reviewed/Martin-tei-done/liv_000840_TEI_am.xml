<lb/><p><space extent="5" unit="words"/>As soon as I was 
<lb/>sufficiently recovered from the severe 
<lb/>indisposition which kept me prostrate
<lb/>for a long time after my arrival at  
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>, I wrote you a full account 
<lb/>of the journey concerning which you 
<lb/>have probably <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> information
<lb/>from other sources. I regretted you 
<lb/>had not <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the earliest intelligence
<lb/>directly from my own hand and that

<lb/>the wreck of the "Forerunner" off <placeName><geogName type="island">Madeira</geogName></placeName>

<lb/>we at last reached <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName></p>
<lb/><p>In passing through a part of <placeName><region>Londa</region></placeName>
<lb/>we found the people exceedingly kind and
<lb/>generally anxious that we should succeed

<lb/>They belong to the <orgName>negro race</orgName> and are
<lb/>more superstitious than any of the <orgName>Southern

<lb/>near every village we observed an idol
<lb/>consisting either of a clay figure of a <term type="animal">lion</term> 
<lb/>or <term type="animal">alligator</term>, or a block of wood on 
<lb/>which a human face was rudely carved.

<lb/>In cases of sickness or of failure in any
<lb/>pursuit offerings of food are presented 
<lb/>and drums beat before them during
<lb/>whole nights. The <term type="tribe">Balonda</term> invariably  
<lb/>go armed with short broad-swords, 
<lb/>large bows and arrows and guns, 
<lb/>and seem to possess but little sense 
<lb/>of security in their own country. Cases 
<lb/>of kidnapping of children occurred 
<lb/>while we were passing and these 
<lb/>with persons who flee from one

<lb/>to half blood <term type="people">Portuguese</term> who visit 
<lb/>the country as <orgName><term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName> dealers</term></orgName>. The country 
<lb/>appeared to contain a large population 
<lb/>and it abounds in the necessaries of 
<lb/>life. The soil is fertile and the

<lb/>the season of the heavy rains which

<lb/>of the year. perpetual drenchings - a
<lb/>hot sun, (the temperature never under 
<lb/>84째 in the shade) quickly drying our  
<lb/>clothing, and frequently sleeping in 
<lb/>damp beds, prevented my forming  
<lb/>a reliable idea of the salubrity of
<lb/>the climate. <orgName>My companions</orgName>, all 
<lb/><orgName>native</orgName> <orgName>Zambesians</orgName> had nearly as 
<lb/>much sickness as myself - intermittent 
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever</term> being the complaint from 
<lb/>which we all suffered most. The

<lb/>abounding in flowing streams is 
<lb/>moreover of great fertility and beauty.  
<lb/>The time spent in the way was also

<lb/>longer than may be required at other
<lb/>seasons, because we had to halt early 
<lb/>in the afternoons in order to allow
<lb/>the men to build little huts for shelter

<lb/>but the plains on our West may

<lb/>us rather <del type="strikethrough" hand="#U">scurvily</del><add place="above" hand="#U">badly</add>. Some levied heavy 
<lb/>fines on the most frivolous pretences 
<lb/>others demanded payment for leave 
<lb/>to pass at all. I parted with everything 
<lb/>I could dispense with and <orgName>my men</orgName> 
<lb/>gave all their armaments &amp; most of 
<lb/>their clothes either for food. fines or

<lb/>we had nothing we could part with besides
<lb/>it did not in the least appease the violence 
<lb/>of the mobs which surrounded us. We
<lb/>must pay either a man, an <term type="animal">ox</term> or a  
<lb/>gun and were looked upon as interlopers 
<lb/>wishing to cheat them out of their dues.  
<lb/>At last on reaching the river <placeName><geogName type="river">Quango</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>by the generous assistance of a young

<lb/>all the way to <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName></p>

<lb/><p>Another matter, for troubling you
<lb/>with which I beg to apologize. As it 
<lb/>may appear very unbusiness like to
<lb/>refer to transactions without positive 
<lb/>dates, I can only plead the destruction 
<lb/>of my papers by the <orgName>Boers</orgName> at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>Having <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> according to order <bibl>periodicals

<lb/>a bill in the usual form to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Maclehose</persName>
<lb/>and at the same time advised you 
<lb/>that the sum (짙20) might be deducted 
<lb/>from my salary. I heard nothing 
<lb/>more of the above referred to bill 
<lb/>nor had <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thompson</persName> any notice

<lb/>I caused it and two other bills, to be

<lb/>current with the <orgName>society</orgName> when in 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="city">Cape Town</settlement></placeName> (<date when="1852">1852</date>). When on my

<lb/>he had not <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the bill of which

<lb/><add place="marginleft" hand="#U" rend="gray">It has not been <unclear cert="low">deducted</unclear></add> address I wish to ascertain whether
