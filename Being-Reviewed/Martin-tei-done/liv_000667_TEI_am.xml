<lb/><p>My dear Father</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/>By the arrival of <unclear cert="low">Hans</unclear> we are enabled to add to our
<lb/>string of palavers and <persName>Joseph</persName> having left only a week ago we have not
<lb/>much to add except that our political horizon is considerably brighter.
<lb/>This is of some importance for when the public attention is engaged
<lb/>by rumours of wars it is more difficult to turn it to matters of higher
<lb/>importance. By our <term type="occupation">spies</term> we have ascertained that the talk of the
<lb/><orgName>Boers</orgName> about <persName>Sechele</persName> is over and the individual near <placeName><settlement type="town">Mosega</settlement></placeName> who
<lb/>made a sort of fortification of his house may sleep undisturbed in
<lb/>his castle. <unclear cert="low">Hans</unclear> brings us notice that <persName>Sekhome</persName> wishes a <term type="occupation">missionary</term>
<lb/>this if true is surprising for he was very much opposed to the word we
<lb/>believe through the influence of <persName>Apie</persName> &amp; <unclear cert="low"><placeName><country>France</country></placeName> God</unclear>. His frequently <!-- This sentence doesn't read correct: pls check HB 6-16-13 --><!-- I think it is ok now, "It is" should have been "His" AM -->
<lb/>expressed dislike made me feel desirous to visit him. I like to hear
<lb/>of one who thinks on the subject. After <persName>Sechele</persName>'s baptism a <orgName>party</orgName>
<lb/>of a distant tribe wished to come here to sell leglets. <persName>Sekhome</persName> would
<lb/>not let them, but taking a roundabout course they arrived &amp; told
<lb/>us that he had stated as his reason for refusal that <persName>Sechele</persName> had
<lb/>become mad.</p>
<lb/><p>We move on as usual - great hunger prevails and a burning
<lb/>sun seems to say we shall have another failure of the <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term>
<lb/>crop. This is the fourth year of stunted crops and the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/>formerly were remarkable for the abundance of their <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term>. The scarcity
<lb/>is usually ascribed to the word of God: the hunger makes some look
<lb/>to us without much good will but all are civil in their deportment.
<lb/>The school suffered much after the reception of <persName>Sechele</persName> but attendance
<lb/>is gradually becoming better. We have finished the roof of <persName>Mebaloe</persName>'s
<lb/>house today, and there is an appearance of rain. All the fountains in
<lb/>the country are dried up. So we cannot grumble &amp; wish we had been
<lb/>elsewhere in this region. I have never seen anything like this
<lb/>drought. The very trees seem to feel it. The leaves crumple together
<lb/>and we hear that there are some tracts of the <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bakalahari</term> country</region></placeName>
<lb/>in which the trees are killed. Our <term type="occupation">rain makers</term> have thrown 
<lb/>their nostrums to the <term type="animal">moles</term> &amp; <term type="animal">bats</term> and some of them come to the meeting
<lb/>Tell <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hamilton</persName> I have looked at the clouds more this year than
<lb/>I did during all the previous years of my life put together and it
<lb/>is all <unclear cert="low"><term type="foodstuff">gammon</term></unclear>. We have had every sort &amp; degree of cloud at all times
<lb/>of the day &amp; night &amp; in all quarters. Clouds with calm &amp; clouds with

	

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000667_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>wind. fleecy, electric violent thunder clouds thick &amp; thin and not a 
<lb/>drop of rain with them. The old grey headed weather-wise jockies were
<lb/>as completely nonplussed <add place="above">as I</add>. They whistled and whiddled, cheeped &amp; muttered
<lb/>and did everything they could (for we do not interfere except in the way
<lb/>of occasional discussion) but no rain. We have had only three good
<lb/>showers this season if you ask anyone now when it threatens
<lb/>do you think it will rain. "It will if it likes" I intend to take
<lb/>this as my motto &amp; not trouble the clouds by looking at them.
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> mentioned a wish to have a Karross from this side. The drought
<lb/>in the <placeName><geogName type="desert">Kalahari</geogName></placeName> side has been so great very few have been able
<lb/>to go thither in search of skins so they are scarcer this year than
<lb/>we ever knew. Only those who have <term type="tribe">Bakalahari</term> near have
<lb/>been able to procure any. - The majority of the people have none. We
<lb/>have bought none for a long time past on account of the scarcity
<lb/>having raised their value. I think I mentioned a brace &amp; bits
<lb/>But have since been supplied with both. I had not seen the
<lb/>gun traps at the time I wrote last. I was very much pleased with
<lb/>your <term type="foodstuff">giblet pie</term>. Can you send two locks for <orgName>natives</orgName> <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> one
<lb/>for <persName>Sechele</persName> &amp; another for <persName>Mebaloe</persName> &amp; <choice><sic>the</sic><corr>then</corr></choice> specify the price to them
<lb/>the roofs of the school temporary &amp; dwelling house with <persName>Mebaloe</persName>'s too have
<lb/>furnished our supply of nails. You have a box full under the
<lb/>bunch of old ones if you wish to see them in use you can
<lb/>send a lot here.</p>
<lb/><p>We enclose a bill for £60. and should like you to square off
<lb/>at the point at which you summed up when you sent the last
<lb/>account and at which there was a balance due by us. of £58..7 
<lb/>and £15..4..1 = £73..11..1. To liquidate this, the Bill &amp;
<lb/>perhaps something else we do not yet know of the Bill in favour
<lb/>of <orgName>Draper &amp; <choice><abbr>co</abbr><expan>Company</expan></choice></orgName> of £28.12. and the enclosed £60. will if I understand
<lb/>properly be available <figure><figDesc>calculation</figDesc></figure>. Let us know if we are right.</p>
<lb/><p>I am not aware of anything which we need at present except soap
<lb/>and <term type="plant_fooodstuff">rice</term>. And if you can without trouble <term type="animal"><choice><sic>hiefers</sic><corr>heifers</corr></choice></term>. We find it
<lb/>much cheaper to pay a <term type="animal"><choice><sic>hiefer</sic><corr>heifer</corr></choice></term> per annum than beads by the month or
<lb/>week. The Blue neck beads were very useful and those sold 
<lb/>produced about 27 <term type="animal">sheep</term> a supply which will enable us to hold on
<lb/>for some time to come. I thank you heartily for the pans &amp; cocks.
<lb/>The former were our only source of <term type="foodstuff">mutton chops</term> <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> the beads
<lb/>came. I am not desirous to obtain any more at present. If
<lb/>you can procure <term type="animal">ewes</term> at the same rate as formerly 3/ please

<lb/>remember us But no <term type="animal">goats</term> on account of the disease in the feet here.
<lb/>We men were very glad of the powder. We gave three strings of beads for a 
<lb/><term type="animal">sheep</term>. <persName>Hume</persName>'s large white <add place="above">neck</add> beads are saleable to the <placeName><region>Eastward</region></placeName> but not at his
<lb/>prices. If he gave them at about 9<hi rend="sup"><choice><abbr>d</abbr><expan>pence</expan></choice></hi> a string we could take them but 
<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> care about dealing with him at all.</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Mary</persName> is much as usual - frequently tired &amp; troubled with pains of
<lb/>different sorts. these are troublesome when she sits up long in one
<lb/>position. She can stir about pretty well Cannot write her Mamma 
<lb/>at present &amp; is quite excusable Wish much I had some <term type="medicament">Chloroform</term>.
<lb/>From the accounts I see of its operation I expect the old ladies will 
<lb/>be wishing they could begin again. It is uniformly safe for both
<lb/>mother &amp; child and the recovery is much accelerated. It is much more
<lb/>speedy in its operation than <term type="medicament">ether</term> &amp; has not any of the <choice><sic>disagreable</sic><corr>disagreeable</corr></choice>
<lb/>effects of that drug. half a teaspoonful sprinkled on a handkerchief
<lb/>&amp; held to the nose is all that is required. there is no lividity coughing,
<lb/>but a calm &amp; gentle sleep &amp; the mothers will scarcely believe when
<lb/>they awaken that they have a child. I should have attempted to make
<lb/>some by a <choice><sic>make shift</sic><corr>makeshift</corr></choice> retort but fear the heat is too great here
<lb/>&amp; it is very volatile. Could we not procure some chloral from
<lb/><placeName><country>England</country></placeName> and a retort. <persName><unclear cert="low">Professor Simpson</unclear></persName> of <placeName><settlement type="city">Edinburgh</settlement></placeName> has 
<lb/>used it in 50 <!-- this could be 56;  Need Check, AJS -->cases with entire success.</p>
<lb/><p>The second bill <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> of £20 we shall feel obliged if you can 
<lb/>cash for us &amp; send it here. We need that article too.</p>
<lb/><p>Have you a tin can such as those used for holding <term type="foodstuff">milk</term>, one
<lb/>below the value of three dollars. A <term type="tribe">Mokwain</term> wishes it</p>
<lb/><p>Heard from a <term type="occupation">bookseller</term> in <placeName><settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement></placeName> that <bibl><term type="occupation">missionary</term> books</bibl>
<lb/>are a drug in the market. Had they been furnished with <bibl><persName>Williams</persName></bibl>
<lb/>&amp; <bibl><persName>Moffat</persName></bibl> only they would have done well But such a flood
<lb/>of small fry followed these. <term type="occupation">Booksellers</term> <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> have even <bibl>Buyers</bibl>
