<lb/>
<lb/><p>My dear Father</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/>We have of late been favoured with three parcels from
<lb/>your quarter, one by <persName><unclear cert="low">Hans Hae</unclear></persName> another By <persName>Rudolf</persName> &amp; the third by <persName>Joseph Abrim</persName>
<lb/>As the last intends to make this his farthest point Northward &amp; will turn round
<lb/>on Monday I begin to think of what I may have to say to <orgName>our southern
<lb/>friends</orgName> and first of all we must as the <orgName>Directors</orgName> say present our
<lb/>acknowledgements for sundries <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> <term type="animal"><term type="foodstuff">Herrings</term></term> - they deserved <!-- Is "Herrings" a place or name? HB 12-5-13 --><!-- It's a type of fish AM -->
<lb/>to be sent whither most of them have now gone with at least a
<lb/>good character. We all liked them, this all including the two old people
<lb/><persName>Robert Manee</persName> &amp; the one who is still on the road home for <persName>Mary</persName> felt
<lb/>greatly the better of one for breakfast. The <term type="plant_foodstuff">apples</term> came in good order
<lb/>&amp; were very welcome - sorry to see the tail end of them. mill locks
<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c all in good condition &amp; everything else so far as I remember.
<lb/>The safety with which these articles came puts me in mind of an
<lb/>annoyance about which I forgot to write last time. though after all
<lb/>I question whether you can do anything to prevent it. Most of the
<lb/><!-- the next 6 lines marked by a vertical pencil line in the left margin AM -->boxes which come to us from <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> are opened &amp; usually lightened
<lb/>of their contents. You will perhaps remember one in which <persName>Sechele</persName>'s
<lb/><unclear cert="low"><choice><sic>cloack</sic><corr>cloak</corr></choice></unclear> was.. It contained on leaving <placeName><settlement type="city"/>Glasgow</placeName> besides the articles which
<lb/>came here a parcel of surgical instruments which I ordered &amp; of course
<lb/>paid for - one of these was a valuable cupping apparatus in which
<lb/>the air was exhausted by a small air pump previous to being applied
<lb/>to the part to be operated upon. At the price which <term type="occupation">medical men</term> <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice>
<lb/>these instruments it was £2.12. - scalpels &amp;c at the same terms
<lb/>amounted to about £2. They were purchased for me by a <term type="occupation">medical
<lb/>gentleman</term>. Their real value was of course much more than the
<lb/>above sums. We think too there were some dresses for <persName>Mary</persName> in it
<lb/>and a magic lantern. The box which you kindly packed for us
<lb/>and dispatched for <placeName><settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement></placeName> has we hear been gutted by the <orgName>Custom
<lb/>House</orgName> <term type="occupation">thieves</term>, &amp; only a few very plain Karosses left in it. When
<lb/>we see a box which has been opened we have not half the
<lb/>pleasure we should otherwise have unpacking it. I ordered some
<lb/>things from <placeName><settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement></placeName> lately but could not tell to whom they ought to
<lb/>be consigned at <placeName><settlement type="town">Algoa Bay</settlement></placeName>. Has <orgName>our society</orgName> any <term type="occupation">agent</term> there now?
<lb/>&amp; do you know whether an invoice sent to an <term type="occupation">agent</term> would
<lb/>prevent the lids being wrenched off as we have had in two cases

<lb/><!-- vertical pencil line in left margin marks the next 4 lines AM -->I requested my friends to apply to the <term type="occupation">secretary</term> for information as to whom they
<lb/>ought to send. Can you give me any information as to how the annoyance
<lb/>may be prevented. or must we submit as to one of the crooked things of this
<lb/>life which <persName>Solomon</persName> tells us cannot be made straight</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><add place="inline" hand="#U" rend="gray">Here begin</add></p>
<lb/><p><persName>Paul</persName> &amp; I went lately in order to erect a temporary building at <placeName><persName>Mokhatla</persName>'s</placeName>
<lb/>in which he might place his family. We found <persName>Potgeiter</persName> close by and
<lb/>somewhat opposed to our work from an idea that we had come to take
<lb/>possession of the land for the <orgName><term type="nationality">English</term> <choice><abbr>Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi></abbr><expan>Government</expan></choice></orgName> We could scarcely get an
<lb/>opportunity to reason with him on the absurdity of this supposition for
<lb/>an individual from <placeName><country>Holland</country></placeName> whom I take to be a <orgName>Jesuit</orgName> would scarcely
<lb/>allow us to speak three words without screaming out at the top of his
<lb/>voice that <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> were like a <term type="ailment">cancer</term> &amp; ought to be shot
<lb/>&amp; a thousand other things which perhaps happily for me I did not <w>under-
<lb break="no"/>-stand</w>. Our friend <persName>Pretorius</persName> told me in private that the <term type="person">Hollander</term> was a 
<lb/>strange fellow - whom no one understood - or knew anything of. Among
<lb/>the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> I observed him always with the <bibl>bible</bibl> lecturing them &amp; when
<lb/>I came near <persName>Potgeiter</persName> he always took it upon himself to answer me
<lb/>and with so much energy the foam gathered at the corners of his
<lb/><term type="bodypart">mouth</term>. In the evening we had a conference with <persName>Potgeiter</persName>
<lb/>&amp; <persName>Pretorius</persName> alone. the former told me that the land was his he
<lb/>had conquered it &amp; intended to remove <persName>Mokhatla</persName> from his present
<lb/>situation to the <placeName><geogName type="river">Limpopo</geogName></placeName> &amp; all our labour would be in vain
<lb/>if we erected a school in the present locality. I felt very unwilling    
<lb/>to defer our commencement for all their violent speeches seemed first
<lb/>to give me the go by. But threatenings to bring a commando against
<lb/><persName>Mokhatla</persName> &amp; not spare us in it seemed to say our labour would
<lb/>be in vain for they would probably burn what we erected. I put it
<lb/>to <persName>Potgeiter</persName> that if he hindered the <bibl>gospel</bibl> the guilt of the loss of many
<lb/>souls would rest on his head. this tickled the old gentleman dreadfully
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="und">Ké ké ké ké</foreign> he tried to speak but the words stuck fast at <term type="bodypart">Adam's
<lb/><term type="plant_foodstuff">apple</term></term>. After saying he did not expect such a word from me he called
<lb/>on <persName>Pretorious</persName> - (our friend) to answer me &amp; he did so by recounting
<lb/>all <persName>Potgeiter<supplied cert="high">'</supplied>s</persName> good deeds. I repeated the sentiments as the truth 
<lb/>but the present state of feeling amongst them of which by the bye we
<lb/>had no idea when we went made me conclude that proceeding at
<lb/>that time with our plans would entail misery on <persName>Mokhatla</persName>. We
<lb/>heard two days afterwards that two <term type="occupation">clergymen</term> from the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> had <!-- geog: Cape Colony -->
<lb/>come to <placeName><persName>Gert Kruger</persName>'s</placeName> to hold a service as it was only two
<lb/>days off we went to see them &amp; secure their influence on our
<lb/>side. there was a goodly company of <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> &amp; <orgName><choice><sic>boeresses</sic><corr>Boeresses</corr></choice></orgName> there
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robertson</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="town"/>Swellendam</placeName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <gap agent="illegible" extent="1" unit="words"/></persName> <placeName><settlement type="town"/>Stellenbosch</placeName> were the

       

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000665_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>operators on the occasion. Seeing a great burly <orgName><choice><sic>boer</sic><corr>Boer</corr></choice></orgName> dressed in black coming
<lb/>out of the place of meeting &amp; <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> the homage of his neighbours, I presumed
<lb/>he was the <choice><sic>prediccant</sic><corr>predicant</corr></choice> &amp; introduced myself in English. He answered in <choice><sic>dutch</sic><corr>Dutch</corr></choice>
<lb/>and after ascertaining that I lived beyond the sphere of <orgName><del type="strikethrough">European</del></orgName> <add place="above">colonial</add> news told
<lb/>me he was the <term type="occupation">commandant</term> <persName>Pretorious</persName>. the <foreign xml:lang="nl">Kwade</foreign> doer of the <term type="people">English</term> -
<lb/>Our <orgName>Jesuit</orgName> friend was also there &amp; striving to stir up the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> against me
<lb/>Having found <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robertson</persName> &amp; made known as much as the bustle of
<lb/>writing down names for <foreign xml:lang="nl"><unclear cert="low">Hoopeiy</unclear></foreign> or whatever else they call it would
<lb/>allow. He seemed very friendly, knew you, shook hands with
<lb/><persName>Paul</persName> at which the <orgName>Boer</orgName> stood astonished. He spoke to <persName>Chevi</persName> &amp;
<lb/><persName>Potgeiter</persName> on our affair. both declared as they have always done their
<lb/>desire to further the <bibl>gospel</bibl> by all means in their power but the
<lb/>state of feeling among their people was such that they could not
<lb/>guarantee our safety if we <choice><sic>builded</sic><corr>built</corr></choice> now - requested us to go
<lb/>on itinerating as usual <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> they had brought forward the subject
<lb/>before their people and, as their minds were decidedly favourable
<lb/>&amp; should be expressed so. we should have a greater probability of permanence
<lb/>they mentioned the violent opposition of some of their people to
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> as a reason for caution. <persName>Chevi</persName> however called
<lb/><persName>Mogale</persName> away next morning when he must have know<supplied cert="high">n</supplied> I wished <del type="strikethrough">to</del>
<lb/>a meeting with the people &amp; I could not hold one. I may however
<lb/>in this be wrong - the people are completely in the power of the
<lb/><orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName>. Great numbers have come from the southward &amp; taken
<lb/>possession of the whole country &amp; every one must be served
<lb/>by the <orgName>natives</orgName>. A larger share of the drudgery falls on <persName>Mokhatla</persName>
<lb/>than on anyone else. Many of them said to us we wish you
<lb/>would come &amp; live here. perhaps the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> would let us alone a little
<lb/>You will be able to gather from the above our prospects in the <placeName><region>Eastward</region></placeName> -
<lb/>I think it will be our duty after <persName>Mary</persName>'s confinement to take <persName>Paul</persName> &amp; family
<lb/>over &amp; make another effort. If they drive us away then the guilt will
<lb/>rest on their heads. I do not feel satisfied that all has been done
<lb/>we can do <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> they do more than mere threatening. If repelled then
<lb/>we can turn our attention somewhere else. But that is certainly
<lb/>a fine <term type="occupation">missionary</term> field. You will remember it in your prayers
<lb/>that the kingdom of <persName>Christ</persName> may be advanced</p>
<lb/><p>Since we have come home we have been building <persName>Mebaloe</persName>'s
<lb/>house But before leaving the <placeName><region>East</region></placeName> I may mention that the <term type="nationality">French</term>
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> sometime ago sent five <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term> to the <term type="tribe">Bamapela</term>
<lb/>tribes. they were directed to go to to <persName>Mokhopane</persName> or <persName>Secoamari</persName>. Had a
<lb/>letter for <persName>Chevi</persName> or perhaps for the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> in general but <persName>Chevi</persName> tore it
<lb/>up &amp; threw it into the fire &amp; took their guns from them

       

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000665_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>they entreated him to give back their guns &amp; he gave them two &amp; kept one - &amp; sent
<lb/>them back. <persName>Mokhatla</persName> told me of it &amp; added the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> sent me an old file
<lb/>I wondered they should send an old thing to one they did not know - the <persName>Bishop
<lb/>of Capeton</persName> said in a public meeting in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> he intended to go beyond other
<lb/>men's line of things <add place="above">with his mission</add>. Why does he not send his <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> to the tribes still
<lb/>farther <placeName><region>Eastward</region></placeName> or rather <placeName><region>Northward</region></placeName> than the <orgName>Caffres</orgName>. <persName>Kamenyana</persName> - <persName>Pelanie</persName><supplied cert="medium">'</supplied>s
<lb/>son is an <choice><sic>agreable</sic><corr>agreeable</corr></choice> youth - very friendly &amp; has a large tribe. We had good
<lb/>meetings there for the first time also at <placeName><persName>Mabe</persName>'s</placeName> &amp; <placeName><persName>Khotlamashne</persName>'s</placeName>
<lb/>I have a very great desire that the <bibl>gospel</bibl> be tried at <placeName><persName>Mokhatla</persName>'s</placeName> the proposition
<lb/>that <persName>Paul</persName> should come &amp; teach him was entirely his own and a station
<lb/>there although <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> have taken possession of the country might be a blessing
<lb/>to very many for he is situated among thousands. He began to collect
<lb/>his people into one town but the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> foiled him. He had a stool
<lb/>&amp; <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> objected to him using it. "You'll be thinking you are a man"
<lb/>We have no hope for success but in the almighty power of God.
<lb/>We did not intend to go near the <orgName><choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName> when we went but <persName>Potgeiter</persName> being
<lb/>near &amp; sending for me to take the latitude for him (which not having
<lb/>my sextant I could not do) seemed like being led to them. If any
<lb/>one feels disposed to blame me for doing too little or too much or doing
<lb/>what I did wrong I can only say I wish they may do better - the <term type="people">French</term>
<lb/>might have succeeded better if they had come with the <term type="occupation">teachers</term> they sent
<lb/>I should not like to see <persName>Mokhatla</persName> taken from us but should not grumble
<lb/>if the <bibl>gospel</bibl> were introduced no matter by whom We earnestly hope these
<lb/>people may be given to the <orgName><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> Mission</orgName>. <add place="inline" hand="#U">/</add> <del type="strikethrough" hand="#U">Fell glad you succeed so
<lb/>well in the different departments of <term type="occupation">missionary</term> labour in your sphere
<lb/>I entertained the same views respecting <persName>Helmore</persName>'s labours as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs M</hi></persName>. expresses long
<lb/>ago but felt disappointed in him when he turned off from <unclear cert="low">Bongeling</unclear> in the way

<lb/>When I visited them about 4 years ago the people were all either professing <orgName>Christians</orgName>
<lb/>or wishing to be so - He states that religion was quite fashionable - I suppose

<lb/>rather than to an outstation of an established mission. this point is
<lb/>interesting in reference to the permanence of the churches raised up in this
<lb/>country. I am not now to be understood as speaking of <persName>Helmore</persName> in
<lb/>particular but should like to know whether the nursing the people
