<br/>my best friends and I suppose

<br/>I have "forgotten myself."
<br/>So many things have occupied
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>my attention of late that
<br/>time speeds on more swiftly
<br/>than ever it did. Indeed
<br/>one has scarcely time to
<br/>think in this whirl and
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>glad I shall be if I again
<br/>get a little time in <span class="">Africa</span>
<br/>to think. I beg you will
<br/>forgive my long silence.
