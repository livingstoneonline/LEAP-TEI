<!-------I have questions for you regarding how to handle the vertical text; the coding guidelines instruct me to end the previous text as a paragraph (even if it's not the end of a paragraph) and open the vertical text as a new paragraph. Do I need to close the vertical text as a paragraph as well, and then reopen the continued horizontal text as a new paragraph? Should I just continue and not mark the continued horizontal text as a new paragraph?------->
