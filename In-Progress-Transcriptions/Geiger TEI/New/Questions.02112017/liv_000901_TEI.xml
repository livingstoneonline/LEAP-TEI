<lb/>this noble <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> in the regions beyond. 
<lb/>As I remained six weeks with the excellent 
<lb/>commandante, <persName>Major T. A. J. A. Secard</persName>, 
<lb/>who generously advised me thus to avoid

<lb/>while recovering from the effects of my 
<lb/>march on foot. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd I mean in this 
<lb/>to give the most trustworthy of my 
<lb/>gleanings concerning the Eastern or

<lb/>by the careless answers of uninterested 
<lb/>inhabitants, I would fain have subjected 
<lb/>every important point to the test of personal 
<lb/>examination, but except in the cases 
<lb/>of gold, coal, iron, and a hot fountain 
<lb/>which did not involve any additional 
<lb/>fatigue, I had to rely on the information 
<lb/>of others alone. The difference of climate 
<lb/>must account for the disproportionate 
<lb/>exhaustion experienced by myself and 
<lb/>companions by marches of a dozen 
<lb/>miles, compared with that produced 
<lb/>in our naval officers by those 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>digious</w> strides we read of having 
<lb/>been performed in the <placeName><choice><sic>Artic</sic><corr>Arctic</corr></choice> circle</placeName>. Indeed 
<lb/>I was pretty well "knocked up" by not 
<lb/>much more than a month on foot. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he climate on the river felt hot and 
<lb/>steamy, water never cool, clothes 
<lb/>always damp from profuse perspiration. 
<lb/><choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd as the country is generally covered 
<lb/>with long grass, bushes and trees, the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000901_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>abundance of well rounded shingle everywhere 
<lb/>renders it necessary to keep the eyes continually 
<lb/>on the ground. Pedestrianism under 
<lb/>such circumstances might be all very 
<lb/>well for those whose obesity 
<lb/>calls for the process of Pressneitz; but for 
<lb/>one who had become as lean as a 
<lb/>lathe, the only discernible good was 
<lb/>that it enabled an honest sort of man to 
<lb/>gain a vivid idea of the meaning of 
<lb/>the phrase "a month on the Treadmill." </p>
<lb/><p>Looking down the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> from 
<lb/>those remarkable falls which I think 
<lb/>ought to be named after our Queen 
<lb/>"the smoke sounding falls of Victoria" 
<lb/>we see the river fringed on both sides 
<lb/>by ranges of hills, of from eight hundred 
<lb/>to a thousand feet in height, on the 
<lb/>right or southern bank, they cease at 
<lb/><placeName>Lupata</placeName> but on the left they run along 
<lb/>to <placeName>Senna</placeName>, terminating in the fine

<lb/>high mountain <placeName>Morumbala</placeName>, with a 
<lb/>hot sulphureous fountain on its 
<lb/>northern summit. A very large number 
<lb/>of conical shaped hills ornament 
<lb/>the ranges and as all are covered to 
<lb/>their tops with fine leafy trees with 
<lb/>patches of lighter green grass between, 
<lb/>the scenery is always pleasing. It 
<lb/>was particularly so in my voyage 
<lb/>down from <placeName>Tette</placeName>, for being the beginning 
<lb/>of winter the foliage had changed 
<lb/>into the most varied hues before 
<lb/>falling off. Some were inky black, 
<lb/>others copper coloured, and others 
<lb/>of so bright an orange I have turned 
<lb/>aside to them, in the belief that they 
<lb/>were masses of flowers. Then here 
<lb/>the stimulus of cold, acts like that 
<lb/>of heat on birds in our climate. 
<lb/>"the time of the singing of birds had come." </p>

<lb/>magnificent one until spoiled by

<lb/>Measured at the fort of <persName>Tette</persName>, it was 
<lb/>found to be five hundred fathoms 
<lb/>or a thousand yards broad, and 
<lb/>that is a narrow part. Below 
<lb/><placeName>Lupata</placeName>, it spreads out among large, 
<lb/>reedy islands from one to two or 
<lb/>more miles broad. It has been in 
<lb/>flood ever since we struck it in 
<lb/>December last, and it looks as if it 
<lb/>would remain high for more than 
<lb/>a month to come. These five months 
<lb/>of high water shew that the statement

<lb/>sized launches for half the year to 
<lb/>be substantially correct. Three and 
<lb/>occasionally four freshets occur 
<lb/>annually at <placeName>Tete</placeName>. The flood of 
<lb/>Northern waters, which inundates 
<lb/>the <placeName>Barotse</placeName> and <placeName>Sesheké</placeName> valleys, 
<lb/>comes into the <placeName>Makololo</placeName> country 
<lb/>in February. The flood of the <placeName>Chobé</placeName>
<lb/>is always a month later, on account 
<lb/>of the impediment which extreme 
<lb/>tortuosity of the river's bed, presents to 
<lb/>its flow. It is often heard of as spreading 
<lb/>over the lands thirty or forty miles 
<lb/>above <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> a fortnight before 
<lb/>it floods that place. In the case of 
<lb/>the river of <placeName>Libébé</placeName> - <placeName>Teoughe </placeName>, <placeName>Zóortzó</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Tamunakle</placeName>, the flood descends 
<lb/>sometimes in April, at other times 
<lb/>much later; but it is not capable 
<lb/>of making an inundation except 
<lb/>in the country near <placeName>Libébé</placeName>; as it 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000901_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/>is discharged into the Lake, till that is full - 
<lb/>the surplus finding its way down the <placeName>Zouga</placeName>
<lb/>to <placeName>Kumadou</placeName> and a little way beyond. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he water in these floods is in all cases 
<lb/>perfectly clear. This peculiarity enabled 
<lb/>me to distinguish the water of the 
<lb/>valley inundations in a large rise 
<lb/>of the river which took place at <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>in the beginning of March. To 
<lb/>the inhabitants it seemed the third 
<lb/>freshet of that year but the water 
<lb/>being comparatively limpid, enabled 
<lb/>me to connect it with the overflowing 
<lb/>at <placeName>Sesheke</placeName> in February. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he two 
<lb/>previous floods produced by rains 
<lb/>falling East of the Eastern ridge,

<lb/>and as they are very numerous above 
<lb/><placeName>Tette</placeName> we <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> the reason  why the 
<lb/>remarkable floods of the clear water 
<lb/>of the great Interior valley have not 
<lb/>been noticed farther down. </p>
<lb/><p>I am aware of no obstruction to 
<lb/>navigation from the bottom of the 
<lb/>Eastern ridge of the Delta except one 
<lb/>named <placeName>Kebrabasa</placeName>, about 20 miles 
<lb/>above <placeName>Tette</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here a number of jagged 
<lb/>rocks jut out of the stream across 
<lb/>the river forming in high water a 
<lb/>dangerous rapid, and at low water 
<lb/>the flow is so zigzag the canoes must 
<lb/>be taken ashore and hauled along 
<lb/>the bank. It is near the district called 
<lb/><placeName>Chicovai</placeName>; but being on foot when 
<lb/>we came near that point we were 
<lb/>obliged to leave the river to avoid 
<lb/>crossing the troublesome rivulets

<lb/>which the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> in its rise had filled, 
<lb/>and we did not know till we arrived at 
<lb/><placeName>Tette</placeName>, that we had thereby missed the 
<lb/>opportunity of examining the only 
<lb/>impediment we are likely to meet with 
<lb/>in our returning upward course. </p>
<lb/><p>Above <placeName>Lupata</placeName> which is about 
<lb/>forty miles below <placeName>Tete</placeName> the river is 
<lb/>kept rather narrow by the hills and 
<lb/>rocks on its banks. It may be 
<lb/>said to be from one thousand to twelve 
<lb/>hundred yards broad. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he current 
<lb/>is 3 3/4 miles per hour: the gorge 
<lb/>of <placeName>Lupata</placeName> is about 200 or 300 yards 
<lb/>wide, twelve miles in length and 
<lb/>rather winding, but so deep close to 
<lb/>its rocky, perpendicular banks a 
<lb/>large steam ship could pass through 
<lb/>at full speed. Below <placeName>Lupata</placeName>
<lb/>the river becomes very broad and 
<lb/>full of large reedy islands which 

	<pb n="0010" facs="liv_000901_0010"/><!--pb/@n='5v'-->
<lb/>prevent one from seeing the banks. I 
<lb/>conjectured the breadth from occasional 
<lb/>glimpses of dark low lying woodland 
<lb/>on the South and the ranges of <placeName>Manganja</placeName>
<lb/>hills on the North. A sailing vessel 
<lb/>would have more room to tack in 
<lb/>here, than in the <placeName>Clyde</placeName> below <placeName>Greenock</placeName>. 
<lb/>I however saw it only when the river
<lb/>was full. In the dry season it presents 
<lb/>a very different appearance, but it is 
<lb/>never without a very large volume 
<lb/>of water flowing in a somewhat 
<lb/>winding channel. But though both 
<lb/>channel and islands change their 
<lb/>positions from time to time according 
<lb/>to the swing and force of the full 
<lb/>flood, free passage is always afforded 
<lb/>for launches and large canoes and 
<lb/>the river is never fordable. Minute 
<lb/>investigation leads me to believe 
<lb/>that a steamer of light draught 
<lb/>could ply on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> during 

	<pb n="0011" facs="liv_000901_0011"/><!--pb/@n='6r'-->
<lb/>the greatest part of the year. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut the 
<lb/>opinion of a seaman might be very different. </p>
<lb/><p>Our surveyors however and visitors to 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimane</placeName> have had but little opportunity 
<lb/>of knowing the capabilities of the river 
<lb/>for that which is called the river of 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimane</placeName> no more deserves the name 
<lb/>of <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>, than does the <placeName>Serpentine</placeName>
<lb/>that of the <placeName>Thames</placeName>. It's proper name 
<lb/>is "<placeName>Mutu</placeName>" and the point of departure 
<lb/>from the main stream "<placeName>Mazaro</placeName>" 
<lb/>"mouth of <placeName>Mutu</placeName>". <placeName>Mazaro</placeName> may thus 
<lb/>be considered the beginning of the 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimane</placeName> <add place="above">delta</add>, as the <placeName>Mutu</placeName>, though small, 
<lb/>is the first branch which leaves the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> for the sea. Its claims may 
<lb/>be understood when I mention that 
<lb/>even now, when the water is at its 
<lb/>greatest height the upper part of the 
<lb/><placeName>Mutu</placeName> is only three or four yards broad. 
<lb/>It is also very winding and so full 
<lb/>of reeds and water plants, together 
<lb/>with over hanging branches of trees

<lb/><add place="marginleft">that</add> a small canoe even can with difficulty 
<lb/>pass along. And during a great part 
<lb/>of the year it is dry, rendering it necessary 
<lb/>to employ land carriage for twelve or 
<lb/>fifteen miles in the case of all commerce 
<lb/>to and from <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> and the interior. 
<lb/>Beyond the part which annually 
<lb/>stands dry, the <placeName>Mutu</placeName><choice><sic>recieves</sic><corr>receives</corr></choice> two rivers 
<lb/>from the North called <placeName>Pingazi</placeName> and

<lb/>make it navigable. Another farther 
<lb/>down named <placeName>Likwareé</placeName> and the 
<lb/>tides contribute to form the River of 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimane</placeName>. The Bar at its entrance 
<lb/>is very dangerous, as it admits small 
<lb/>vessels as schooners only twice 
<lb/>a month and it is a common 
<lb/>remark that but few of these can go 
<lb/>both in and out unscathed. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his

<lb/>communicated that eight of my 
<lb/>countrymen in coming from H.

<lb/>a passage homewards had unfortunately 
<lb/>lost their lives. It caused me the 
<lb/>most poignant sorrow and made

<lb/>times was large but is now filled 
<lb/>up with a fluvial deposit. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he bar too 
<lb/>was safer then than it is now. To a 
<lb/>stranger it looks remarkable that the 
<lb/>mainstream of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> sometimes 
<lb/>called <placeName>Cuama</placeName> and <placeName>Luaba</placeName> which 
<lb/>is at least three quarters of a mile 
<lb/>broad at the mouth of the <placeName>Mutu</placeName>
<lb/>should be left to roll on to the ocean 
<lb/>unused. It divides it is true below 
<lb/>that into six or seven branches 
<lb/>but two of these named near the 
<lb/>sea <placeName>Melambe</placeName> and <placeName>Catrina</placeName> present 
<lb/>comparatively safe harbours at 
<lb/>their mouths, and free passage for 
<lb/>large launches during the entire 
<lb/>year into the interior. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hese harbours 
<lb/>are not more insalubrious than 
<lb/><placeName>Quilimane</placeName> and <placeName>Senna</placeName>. Indeed with 
<lb/>respect to the former one could scarcely 
<lb/>by search get a better man-killing 
<lb/>spot than it. The village is placed 

	<pb n="0015" facs="liv_000901_0015"/><!--pb/@n='8r'-->
<lb/>on a large mudbank so moist water 
<lb/>is found by digging two feet down and 
<lb/>it is surrounded by Mango bushes and 
<lb/>marsh. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he walls of the houses too 
<lb/>sink gradually so as to jam the doors. 
<lb/>That the subject of securing a better 
<lb/>harbour for the commerce of the 
<lb/>magnificent country, drained by the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> merits the attention of the 
<lb/>Portuguese Government as interested 
<lb/>in its prosperity, a glance at the articles 
<lb/>which might be exploited to a great 
<lb/>amount will sufficiently shew. </p>
<lb/><p>If we again fancy ourselves looking 
<lb/>down the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>, from its confluence 
<lb/>with the river <placeName>Loangua</placeName>, we find that 
<lb/>a soft grey sandstone rock <add place="marginleft">with many silicified trees &amp; palms for the surface</add> forms, 
<lb/>to use an ungeological expression, the 
<lb/>flooring of the country all the way 
<lb/>to <placeName>Lupata</placeName>. This space <add place="above">a trapezoid in form</add> 3° of Long<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 
<lb/>and 2° or more of Latitude &amp; is if I am 
<lb/>not mistaken a field of coal; for 

	<pb n="0016" facs="liv_000901_0016"/><!--pb/@n='8v'-->
<lb/>the rock is in many places cut through 
<lb/>and dislocated by dykes of greenstone 
<lb/>and basalt. There are also broad bands 
<lb/>of gneiss &amp; Porphyry, with hills of baked 
<lb/>clay and <del type="strikethrough">other</del> igneous rocks containing 
<lb/>much silica and mica. The disturbances 
<lb/>effected by the eruptive rocks in the 
<lb/>grey sandstone have brought many 
<lb/>seams of coal to the surface. There 
<lb/>are no fewer than nine of these in 
<lb/>the country adjacent to <placeName>Tette</placeName> and I 
<lb/>came upon two before reaching that 
<lb/>point. One seam in the rivulet 
<lb/><placeName>Muatize</placeName> is fifty-eight inches in 
<lb/>diameter. Another is exposed in the 
<lb/><placeName>Morongoze</placeName> which as well as the 
<lb/><placeName>Muatize</placeName> falls into the <placeName>Revubue</placeName> and 
<lb/>that forms the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> from the 
<lb/>North about two miles below <placeName>Tette</placeName>. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he <placeName>Revubue</placeName> is navigable for canoes

<lb/>of junction with the rivulets canoes 
<lb/>might be loaded at the seams themselves. 
<lb/>Some of the rocks have been ejected 
<lb/>since the deposition of the coal for it is

<lb/>emergence is 158° Fah<hi rend="sup">t</hi> and when the 
<lb/>thermometer is held in it half a minute 
<lb/>it shews steadily 160°. When frogs 
<lb/>or fish leap into it from the 
<lb/>rivulet in which it is situated they 
<lb/>become cooked and the surrounding stones 
<lb/>were <add place="above">much</add> too hot for the bare feet 
<lb/>of my companions. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he remarks about the absence of 
<lb/>any tradition of earthquakes in my 
<lb/>last letter must be understood in 
<lb/>reference to the country between the 
<lb/>ridges alone, for I find that shocks 

	<pb n="0018" facs="liv_000901_0018"/><!--pb/@n='9v'-->
<lb/>have frequently been felt in the country 
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Maravi</term> and also at <placeName>Mosam<hi rend="sup">que</hi></placeName>
<lb/>but all have been of short durations 
<lb/>and appeared to pass from East

<lb/><p>In addition to coal we have iron of 
<lb/>excellent quality in many parts of the

<lb/>a native doctor pointed out a root which

<lb/>Island of <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> at the Western 
<lb/>entrance, where we have a fine view of 
<lb/>the highest part of the whole range viz. the

<lb/>I question if it is more than 700 feet high

<lb/>The northern part of <placeName>Lupata</placeName> range

<lb/>Another month of the climate would have 

	<pb n="0044" facs="liv_000901_0044"/><!--pb/@n='22v'-->
<lb/>been fatal to the whole. I reached <placeName>Quillimane</placeName>
<lb/>labouring under a severe tertian but found 
<lb/>that <persName>Captain Nolloth</persName> late of the Frolic had 
<lb/>left me some wine and his surgeon 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Walsh</persName> some quinine which with the

<lb/>in letters from my former instructors in 
<lb/><placeName>Glasgow</placeName> University from - <persName>Commodore Trotter</persName>
<lb/>and from yourself soon restored me to

<lb/>of the party accompanied me on board

<lb/>feeling grateful to him for his invaluable 
<lb/>services I wished to comply with the 
<lb/>desire of <persName>Sekeletu</persName> and take him to 
<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, believing that a report 
<lb/>of wisdom and power of Englishmen 
<lb/>from his lips would have a beneficial 
<lb/>effect on the minds of his countrymen 
<lb/>in relation to Christianity. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut the 
<lb/>excitement of seeing so many new 
<lb/>things seemed to prove too much for 
<lb/>his brain and during the night after 
<lb/>seeing the steamer towing us into this 
<lb/>harbour, he became quite insane 
<lb/>and drowned himself. He could swim

<lb/>well, but hauled himself down by the 
<lb/>chain cable. I felt unwilling to use 
<lb/>constraint because being a gentleman in 
<lb/>his own country I feared lest a taint 
<lb/>of insanity should remain after our return 
<lb/>and that he might prejudice the minds of 
<lb/>his countrymen by representing confinement 
<lb/>as an act of cruelty, my regret for not 
<lb/>using constraint is now unavailing. 
<lb/>We lost another headman above <placeName>Tette</placeName> by a

<lb/>As they never dance fully armed &amp; dressed except 
<lb/>when about to attack and I had no intention 
<lb/>to be scared backwards by them this poor 
<lb/>man became mad from excitement which 
<lb/>was probably aggravated by remembrance of 
<lb/>former scenes in which he had figured and 
<lb/>ran off by night. We spent three days seeking him
