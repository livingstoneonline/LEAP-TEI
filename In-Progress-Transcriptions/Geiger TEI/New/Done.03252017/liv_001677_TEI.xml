<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Robert</persName></p>
				<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>You asked me once 
<lb/>if this Lake were beautiful. I am 
<lb/>now 120 miles up from its southern 
<lb/>end, and yet I cannot very well answer 
<lb/>your question for this is the time of 
<lb/>
year in which a great deal of grass is 
<lb/>burned and the air is so hazy that 
<lb/>one cannot see any distance. We can 
<lb/>however make out that it is, as 
<lb/>far as we have yet gone, encircled 
<lb/>with mountains - and highland scenery 
<lb/>is always beautiful. We suppose it 
<lb/>to be 30 or 40 miles broad at its wider 
<lb/>parts but should we have fair weather 
<lb/>we hope to measure it by means of the 
<lb/>stars, a chronometer and sextant. It is 
<lb/>very deep in some parts, we could 
<lb/>feel no bottom at 35 fathoms or 210 
<lb/>
feet. At present it is frequently 
<lb/>stormy and its waves rise very high 
<lb/>in a very short space of time - Its 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001677_0002"/><!--pb/@n='112v'--> 
<lb/><add place="above">shores</add> are crowded with inhabitants and 
<lb/>as they never saw white men before 
<lb/>they swarm around us as boys do a 
<lb/>black man at home. An Arab vessel 
<lb/>called a dhow ran away to the Eastern 
<lb/>side when we came near. It had a 
<lb/>cargo of slaves. The object we have in 
<lb/>view in coming is to put a stop to 
<lb/>this traffic and we hope to do so by 
<lb/>introducing lawful commerce &amp; 
<lb/>the gospel of Christ. We went up with 
<lb/><persName>bishop Mackenzie</persName> to the highlands <del type="strikethrough">to</del>
<lb/>to shew him a healthy place and 
<lb/>introduce him to the people and 
<lb/>met four parties of slave hunters. 
<lb/>We took about 140 captives from them 
<lb/>and I gave them to the <persName>bishop</persName> to 
<lb/>commence his mission with. 
<lb/>Most of them were women and children 
<lb/>all naked and tied to each other by 
<lb/>thongs passed round their necks. the 
<lb/>men had a horrid stick on their necks 
<lb/>fastened with iron. these slave 
<lb/>hunters had induced a number of 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001677_0003"/><!--pb/@n='113'--> 
<lb/><choice><sic>of </sic><corr>notext</corr></choice> another tribe to capture people for 
<lb/>them we came to this tribe while burning 
<lb/>three villages. and though we told them 
<lb/>that we came peaceably and to talk 
<lb/>with them they saw that we were a 
<lb/>small party and might easily be 
<lb/>overcome. rushed at us and shot 
<lb/>their posioned arrows. One fell between 
<lb/>the <persName>bishop</persName> and me another whizzed 
<lb/>between another man &amp; me. We had to 
<lb/>drive them off, and they left that 
<lb/>part of the country. Before going 
<lb/>near them the <persName>bishop</persName> engaged in prayer 
<lb/>and during the prayer we could hear 
<lb/>the wail for the dead by some <unclear cert="high">manganja</unclear>
<lb/>probably <!-- not -->thought <!-- moved from before -->not<!-- end added text --> worth killing, 
<lb/>and the shouts of welcome home to these 
<lb/>bloody murderers. It turned out that 
<lb/>these were only some sixty or seventy 
<lb/>robbers and not the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> tribe 
<lb/>so we had a narrow escape from 
<lb/>being murdered</p>
<lb/><p>How are you doing? I fear 
<lb/>from what I have observed of your 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001677_0004"/><!--pb/@n='113v'--> 
<lb/>temperament that you will have 
<lb/>to strive against fickleness. Everyone 
<lb/>has his <unclear cert="medium">besetting</unclear> fault. That is no 
<lb/>disgrace to him but it is a disgrace 
<lb/>if he does not find it out and by God 
<lb/>grace overcome it. Your Uncle <persName>Robert</persName>
<lb/>is very fickle, never overcame it, has 
<lb/>had many opportunities of suceeding 
<lb/>in life but wanted steadfastness of 
<lb/>purpose and is now settled down as 
<lb/>a poor trader. I am not near to advise 
<lb/>you what to do but whatever line of 
<lb/>life you choose resolve to stick to it 
<lb/>and serve God therein to the last. Whatever 
<lb/>failings you are conscious of tell 
<lb/>them to your Heavenly Father, strive 
<lb/>daily to master them and confess all 
<lb/>to him when conscious of having gone 
<lb/>astray. And May the Good Lord of 
<lb/>all impart all the strength you need 
<lb/>commit your way unto the Lord 
<lb/>Trust also in him, and acknowledge 
<lb/>him in all your ways and He will 
<lb/>bless you. I am writing now 
<lb/>because we cannot put out 
<lb/>in the boat through the surf. It 
<lb/>hinders our progress greatly.</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">I hope to write to each of you 
<lb/>before we reach the sea in 
<lb/>January next. Ever affectionately</p>
