<lb/><p rend="right"><space extent="1" unit="chars"/><placeName>Rovuma Bay</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><space extent="3" unit="chars"/>8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March, 1861</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My dear Friend,</p>
<lb/><p>By our new vessel which touched 
<lb/>at <placeName>Loanda</placeName> I hear that you are gone to 
<lb/>England. I take the liberty of intruding on your 
<lb/>holiday with a subject that is of some importance 
<lb/>in the geographical world, and concerning me as 
<lb/>an attempt by a literary friend to deprive of the 
<lb/><choice><sic>honor</sic><corr>honour</corr></choice> of being the first European that crossed 
<lb/>the continent and throw discredit on my 
<lb/>statements.</p>
<lb/><p>In 1853 or 4 (I quote from memory) 
<lb/>I met a <persName>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Silva Porto</persName> of darkish <choice><sic>color</sic><corr>colour</corr></choice>, but 
<lb/>having straight hair which was cut short, at 
<lb/><placeName>Linyante</placeName> and in the Barotse country (<unclear cert="low">nalide</unclear>). 
<lb/>He told me that he had attempted to go 
<lb/>eastwards but had been prevented from 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>ceeding</w> more than a few days beyond where 
<lb/>I met him. His attempt was made during 
<lb/>the same time that I was ascending to the 
<lb/>Barotse, and having met there, his attempt 
<lb/>could not possibly have been far. He stated 
<lb/>also that he had sent his people by a southern 
<lb/>route eastwards, and they too had been 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>pelled</w> to return after proceeding but a short 
<lb/>distance. He invited me to go with him 
<w>west-<lb break="no"/>wards</w> as he was then only waiting for the 
<lb/>rains to begin his homeward journey, but I 
<lb/>declined in order to avoid slave company and 
<lb/>a slave path. I was much longer on the 
<lb/>unknown route I adopted than he and when 
<lb/>I was in your house his <choice><reg>j</reg><orig>J</orig></choice>ournal was being 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="center"><space extent="5" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>printed</fw> 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001638_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>printed piece meal in the 'Boletin'. His 
<lb/>meeting with me was noticed in his <choice><reg>j</reg><orig>J</orig></choice>ournal 
<lb/>and so was my waggon, &amp;c, but not a syllable 
<lb/>about his having crossed over to <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>.</p>
<lb/><p>You told me that when the Arabs came 
<lb/>to <placeName>Banguela</placeName> that the Government of <placeName>Loanda</placeName>
<lb/>offered a conto of Reis and an honorary 
<lb/>Captaincy in the army to any one who would 
<lb/>accompany them to the East Coast but none 
<lb/>volunteered. <persName>Porto's</persName> difficulties and inability 
<lb/>in attempting to go East were one of the reasons 
<lb/>that induced me to go West. I had not the 
<lb/>smallest ambition to accomplish the feat I 
<lb/>was afterwards led to perform.</p>
<lb/><p>Now, a <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Macqueen</persName> has produced 
<lb/>a <choice><reg>j</reg><orig>J</orig></choice>ournal to the R.G.S. in which it is 
<lb/>fraudulently made to appear that <persName>Porto</persName>
<lb/>went over to <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>, and discovered 
<lb/>all that we have since made known. It is 
<lb/>I believe published in the 'Proceedings' of the 
<lb/>R.G.S. but this additional piece was certainly 
<lb/>not published at <placeName>Loanda</placeName>, and <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Macqueen</persName>
<lb/>seems to be the victim of a literary fraud, and 
<lb/>through him the Geographical Society. Have 
<lb/>you any objection to give to <persName>Sir Roderick 
<lb/>Murchison</persName> your recollections of the publication. 
<lb/><persName>Porto</persName> is now said to have been sent by the <persName>Governor 
<lb/>of Loanda</persName> and to have returned /54 (when I 
<lb/>was with you) from <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>. He could 
<lb/>not have done so without your knowledge 
<lb/>surely and had he done so the Portuguese 
<lb/>minister who claims the <choice><sic>honor</sic><corr>honour</corr></choice> for his country would 
<lb/>not have gone back to 1815 to two black men 
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right"><space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>who</fw> 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001638_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>who only came to <placeName>Tette</placeName> (Blue Book, 1856-7).</p>
<lb/><p>You may remember too, that when I 
<lb/>wished for two <gap extent="2" unit="words" agent="damage"/>, the Governor 
<lb/>on <unclear cert="low">E. do Amiral</unclear> in politely aiding me 
<lb/>in reference to them, made mention of the 
<lb/>anxiety of the Government to ascertain the 
<lb/>possibility of crossing to the East coast, and 
<lb/>spoke quite in accordance with your 
<w>state-<lb break="no"/>ment</w> to me that no one had then been 
<lb/>found among his countrymen to attempt it.</p>
<lb/><p>If you have no objection to state your 
<lb/>recollections on these points to <persName>Sir Roderick</persName>, 
<lb/>you will enable the Society to judge how 
<lb/>far it has been imposed on by a literary 
<lb/>fraud concocted by some one from the 
<lb/>information we have since given about 
<lb/><placeName>Shirwa</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. I think <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Macqueen</persName>
<lb/>has been duped by some zealous Portuguese.</p>
<lb/><p>We are now off the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> and in 
<lb/>search of an entrance into the interior of Eastern 
<lb/>Africa exterior to Portuguese claims; the 
<lb/>river promises well. No bar &amp; no bottom across 
<lb/>the mouth with a line of seventeen fathoms. A 
<lb/>large body of water a mile wide rushes out, but 
<lb/>this is the rainy season. You will hear all 
<lb/>about the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Mission at home. 
<lb/>I have persuaded <persName>Bishop Mackenzie</persName> to post-pone 
<lb/>his landing for three months, he will then be 
<lb/>into the <del type="strikethrough">most</del> three most healthy months of 
<lb/>the year. He is at <placeName>Johanna</placeName>. My heart 
<lb/>rejoices at the prospect of the gospel <del type="strikethrough">soon</del> being 
<lb/>soon planted in this trodden down land.</p>
<lb/><p>If we get an overland route to <placeName>Nyassa's</placeName>
<lb/><fw type="catch" place="marginbottom" rend="right"><space extent="3" unit="chars"/>North-</fw>

<lb/>North-end we shall prefer it, though it be 
<lb/>three times as long as that past <placeName>Murchison's 
<lb/>cataracts</placeName> up <placeName>Shire</placeName>. We shall soon be able 
<lb/>to give information about <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>. We now 
<lb/>wait only for coals. As soon as we do that 
<lb/>every body knew all about it long before. 
<lb/>Why publish what they knew first.</p>
<lb/><p>Sorry to hear of our poor friend <persName>Brand's</persName>
<lb/>death. God grant that we may do something 
<lb/>of good before our time is past. I made a 
<lb/>mistake in giving our prescription substituting 
<lb/>Calomel for Rhubarb, and now add the true 
<lb/>formula.</p>
