<lb/>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Vardon</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I have written to you twice 
<lb/>since I came out but having <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> no 
<lb/>answer I fear the letters may have 
<w>mis-<lb break="no"/>carried.</w> I shall therefore try to reach you 
<lb/>by way of your brother in London. </p>
<lb/><p>We are down here waiting the arrival of 
<lb/>our new steamer which we understand 
<lb/>is to be a <hi rend="underline">real</hi> one and made not merely 
<lb/>to draw grist to the mill of some greedy 
<lb/>contractor. We have about a hundred 
<lb/>miles of swamp in our rear, and eight 
<lb/>of these the deadly mangrove marsh. 
<lb/>Our neighbours are six black "rogers" 
<lb/>sent by the Portuguese to assert their 
<lb/>sovereignty over a flag staff, and a port 
<lb/>which we discovered - and plenty of 
<lb/>waterbucks, oryxes &amp; bush bucks. 
<lb/>So you may be sure we often send a wistful

<lb/><add place="above">glance</add> across the watery waste in front. </p>
<lb/><p>We lately went up to <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> on foot. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he only points of importance we ascertained, 
<lb/>were the presence of very fine cotton in the 
<lb/>central parts of the country, and the extension 
<lb/>of the coal field up to near <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName>. 
<lb/>These same falls too after a second visit 
<lb/>we feel inclined to pronounce the most 
<lb/>wonderful in the world. We could see clearly 
<lb/>to the bottom of one half of the Falls - the water 
<lb/>being lower at the time than we ever saw it. 
<lb/>And the depth is not 100 feet as I conjectured, 
<lb/>but 310 feet, or nearly twice the depth of 
<lb/><placeName>Niagara</placeName>. Then the breadth is not 1000 yards 
<lb/>as formerly stated, but nearly 2000 yards 
<lb/>we say 1860 by way of assisting the <del type="strikethrough">memory</del> 
<lb/>memory. Though this is a little more. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen <figure><!--<graphic style="float:left" url="LETT1161-1.gif"/>--><figDesc>diagram of a river</figDesc></figure>
<lb/>to allow one to see them with the 
<lb/>utmost advantage the crack into which 
<lb/>the river rolls is prolonged in a zigzag 
<lb/>manner and the promontories made 
<lb/>by the wavy line allow one to walk 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001616_0003"/><!--pb/@n='68r'--> 
<lb/>along in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. facing the falls, or in N<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi> 2 with 
<lb/>the river on each side, and some 300 or 400 
<lb/>feet below jammed in the bottom of the 
<lb/>crack in 20 or 30 yards - the promontories 
<lb/>are lower &amp; have perpendicular sides, and 
<lb/>are of the same height as the bed of the river 
<lb/>above the falls. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he base of No 1 is only 400 
<lb/>paces of N<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi> 2 - 150 <unclear>D<hi rend="sup underline">o</hi></unclear> so you can by a few 
<lb/>steps see the river running in opposite ways. </p>
<lb/><p>We returned by buying canoes below 
<lb/>the falls, and sailing down to <placeName>Chicova</placeName> -Thence 
<lb/>we marched again on foot to <placeName>Tette</placeName>. From 
<lb/><placeName>Kafue</placeName> to the falls there are more large animals 
<lb/>than in any part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> we have seen. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he numbers of elephants, buffaloes &amp; 
<lb/>hippopotomi were really prodigious. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>were obliged to come to the water for it 
<lb/>was the dry season. We saw a pure 
<lb/>white hippopotomus &amp; several piebald 
<lb/>ones. Two half caste Portuguese traders with 
<lb/>about 400 slaves had got 40,000 lbs of 
<lb/>ivory by shooting and trading in a few months<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>countrymen are prevented from reaping any 
<lb/>of the benefits by that stupid treaty of <persName>Sir George 
<lb/>Cathcart</persName> with the Boers. </p>
<lb/><p>I am very much delighted with the prospect 
<lb/>of a mission from the English Universities. 
<lb/>It is going on briskly, and I expect that 
<lb/>it will soon make a beginning in 
<lb/>some part of this coast. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he work before 
<lb/>it is nothing less than the final extermin
<lb/>ation of the slave trade by the introduction 
<lb/>of commerce and the gospel into the 
<lb/>slave market. And I trust that soon, that 
<lb/>great body the church of England may 
<lb/>feel itself committed to this great &amp; 
<lb/>noble enterprise. I have great faith in 
<lb/>that church if it only sets to work. </p>
<lb/><p>You may hear of a very untoward 
<lb/>commencement made by the <placeName>London</placeName> 
<lb/>missionaries at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>y some 
<lb/>inadvertence, it is supposed, we were 
<lb/>not made aware of their movements till 
<lb/>we reached <placeName>Victoria falls</placeName>, and then we 
<lb/>heard that they had arrived, and six out

<lb/>of nine Europeans, and four native 
<lb/>attendants, had perished of fever - this 
<lb/>happened at the very time we were on our 
<lb/>way up and curing the disease so quickly 
<lb/>that a severe case, in a European even, 
<lb/>rarely detained us more than a day or two 
<lb/>though our march was on foot. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>remedy was found to be effectual first 
<lb/>in my own children and in a party of 
<lb/>English at <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> in 1850, and 
<lb/>I have never failed in a single case 
<lb/>since. It is referred to in the "Missionary 
<lb/>Travels" but I deeply regret that I had 
<lb/>not an opportunity of pressing it on 
<lb/>the attention of these good people in time. 
<lb/>One of them <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Helmore</persName> you probably 
<lb/>saw - he was a personal friend and 
<lb/>an excellent missionary. This threw a 
<lb/>damp on our visit to the <placeName>Makalolo</placeName>. </p>
<lb/><p>You will be pleased to hear that 
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> is doing well. He has nine tribes 
<lb/>under him. And has a Hanoverian <unclear cert="low">Missionary</unclear>

<lb/><persName>Mosilikatze</persName> has <persName>John Moffat</persName> as his 
<lb/>missionary - (and another)- He is still the 
<lb/>same old rogue yet is unable to walk 
<lb/>from something the matter with his knees, 
<lb/>and I fear will be <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> to the end of 
<lb/>the chapter. We met some of his people 
<lb/>down at <del type="strikethrough">Mosilik</del><placeName>Senna</placeName> lately. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>fled on seeing my Makololo. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey had 
<lb/>come to buy guns. Laws here dreadfully 
<lb/>stringent against selling guns to natives, 
<lb/>but neither Governors nor governed 
<lb/>mind the laws on that subject. </p>
<lb/><p>Please present my very kind 
<lb/>greetings to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> V</persName>. My wife is 
<lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName> &amp; not very sweet because 
<lb/>I stay so long away. We shall get
