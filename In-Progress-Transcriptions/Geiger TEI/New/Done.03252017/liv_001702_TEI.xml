<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I have to thank you for several 
<lb/>letters <add place="above">up to 5<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> May</add> which as usual came in a heap. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he mail 
<lb/>was brought up by three of the Ox &amp; Cam. missionaries 
<lb/>who came up the <placeName>Shire</placeName> in common country 
<lb/>canoes without knowing a word of the language 
<lb/>or a bit of the way - a feat I believe never yet 
<lb/>performed by a Portuguese. Thanks for all 
<lb/>your kindness in writing and in <hi rend="underline">doing</hi> on our 
<lb/>behalf. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Pioneer is I am sorry to find much 
<lb/>too deep for river work. We observed that in 
<lb/>the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> - and again when we reached 
<lb/>the upper part of the <placeName>Elephant Marsh</placeName>. Below 
<lb/>that she has plenty of water. We warped her 
<lb/>up some 20 or 30 miles in order to place the 
<lb/>missionaries and our men in a healthy spot 
<lb/>at <persName>Chibisa's</persName>, and will do the same to place 
<lb/>our new steamer on the Lake. Were it possible 
<lb/>to put Pioneer on the Lake she would suit 
<lb/>us admirably. She is so strong and nothing 
<lb/>but a strong and deep boat will do there. 
<lb/>After seeing the missionaries up to the Highlands 
<lb/>we carried a boat past <placeName>Murchison's Cataracts</placeName>
<lb/>a distance in Lat of 35º but about 40º with the 
<lb/>Longitude. When there we are virtually on the 
<lb/>Lake for the <placeName>Upper Shire</placeName> is all deep and smooth<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The Lake is very deep. As the <placeName>Shire</placeName> is 
<lb/>from 9 to 15 feet so the Lake gradually deepens 
<lb/>to as many fathoms. Then in rounding a 
<lb/>mountainous promontory which gives a 
<lb/>forked appearance to the southern end 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001702_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'--> 
<lb/>and which we wish to name Cape Maclear - we 
<lb/>felt no bottom with our leadline of 35 fathoms 
<lb/>at a mile from the shore. In the north in 11º 40º S.
<lb/>Lat. we tried with a fishing line in a bay and found 
<lb/>bottom at 100 fathoms - a mile outside no bottom 
<lb/>at 116 fathoms but the line broke in coming up 
<lb/>a ship would not get anchorage except near 
<lb/>the Shore, but there are several small rounded 
<lb/>rocky islands and adjacent to these as also 
<lb/>to all the rocky headlines there are rocks jutting 
<lb/>out or only covered with a few feet of water. 
<lb/>The Lake is from 20 to 50 or 60 miles broad 
<lb/>but we could not measure it by a chronometer 
<lb/>as we were there during the Equinoctial gales 
<lb/>and tremendous seas get up in 15 or 20 minutes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The rollers are as large as I ever saw at the mouth 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey come across the Lake with 
<lb/>perpendicular sides and hairy heads and break 
<lb/>in 14 or 15 fathoms. We had to beach the boat 
<lb/>every night to prevent her being swamped at anchor 
<lb/>and often durst not attempt to launch her. 
<lb/>An Arab dhow lately built to carry slaves across 
<lb/>fled from us twice to the Eastern shore. It would 
<lb/>have been madness to have wished ourselves in 
<lb/>a slight open boat. Though the great object of 
<lb/>our exploration was not attained, I mean the 
<lb/>question of the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>, I cannot blame myself. 
<lb/>We did all than it was possible to do - and 
<lb/>came back as lean and dried up as red herrings<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We could see that the Lake is surrounded by 
<lb/>mountains and high table lands. It was only 
<lb/>by sketches and bearings <add place="above">at different Latitudes</add> of these as the sun rose 
<lb/>behind them that we got an approximation to 
<lb/>the width. When we passed 11 º 40 º S. we came to 
<lb/>a recently depopulated region. Human skeletons 
<lb/>and putrid bodies lay everywhere - no food 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001702_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'--> 
<lb/>was to be had and some of the people - a tribe of 
<lb/>Zulus from the south originally, fled from us. The 
<lb/>boat went about 20º beyond the last latitude I took. 
<lb/>I went nearly as far as the mountains. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hence 
<lb/>and also from the boat 20º more could be seen. 
<lb/>So we may say that the Lake extends to the southern 
<lb/>borders of the tenth degree of south Latitude. It begins 
<lb/>in 14º 25º and may be 225 miles long. We say over 
<lb/>200 miles. Pirates live on detached rocks on 
<lb/>that part of the coast, and food was so scarce that 
<lb/>a fathom of cloth was demanded for a fish's 
<lb/>head. We came away back along the West shore 
<lb/>the reports about <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> as contradictory as 
<lb/>possible. One man asserted positively that 
<lb/>we could sail out of the Lake into the river, a 
<lb/>second that we must lift the boat a few yards 
<lb/>a third - fifty miles. A fourth a hundred. All 
<lb/>agreed in saying that it is a very large river. 
<lb/>The islands are uninhabited, with perhaps one 
<lb/>exception - no current could be detected. It 
<lb/>rises and falls about 3 feet between the dry &amp; 
<lb/>wet seasons. The population is prodigiously 
<lb/>large. I never saw so many people as those 
<lb/>who live on its shores. Slaving is the only trade. 
<lb/>I was much disappointed in not finding 
<lb/>a large river on the West that would have 
<lb/>lessened the Longitude to the <placeName>Makololo Country</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Five rivers flow in on that side but they are 
<lb/>small. The Lake is not much longer than we 
<lb/>have seen for the people do not cross but go 
<lb/>round it where we turned. </p>
<lb/><p>It will take us a whole year to carry our 
<lb/>vessel past the rapids. We were stationary at 
<lb/><persName>Chibisa's</persName> yet collected with ease cotton equal 
<lb/>to 300 lbs of clean cotton - the price very low
<lb/>and our calico so flimsy that we felt we 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001702_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'--> 
<lb/>guilty of cheating them. It is high time that regular 
<lb/>cotton agents should begin their work. Had we been 
<lb/>able to run up and down a great deal more could 
<lb/>have been bought. The goods <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Clegg</persName> sent are quite 
<lb/>unsuitable for the people here. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Aspinal Turner</persName>
<lb/>supplied us before. £45 worth bought by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName>
<lb/>at the Cape possessed the same character for flimsiness 
<lb/>and while in going North we could buy any amount 
<lb/>of food, in coming South we have been found out, 
<lb/>and we could not get enough to satisfy hunger - 
<lb/>they fling the cloth at us, and called it mosquito 
<lb/>curtains. An investment <add place="above">by <persName>May</persName></add> in a sort of penny 
<lb/>trumpet is quite unsaleable - so are trumpety 
<lb/>looking glasses. Had <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName> refrained from 
<lb/>spending money at the Cape, we could have supplied 
<lb/>ourselves with strong American calico on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>at a cheaper rate <del type="strikethrough">than</del> and saved ourselves the 
<lb/>annoyance of seeing slave buyers with better 
<lb/>cloth than we could offer. The unavoidable injury 
<lb/>to our character for fair dealing is lamentable, 
<lb/>the velvet is a good deal weaker than common 
<lb/>brown paper. I shall be obliged to purchase 
<lb/>other stuff for wages at the roadmaking. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> writes that he has put down a 
<lb/>watch for me among his losses. We sent 2 
<lb/>pocket chronometers by him for cleaning &amp; 
<lb/>repair. I believe I gave you the numbers. I had 
<lb/>no watch there, but a silver thermometer case 
<lb/>as my own pocket chronometer is now 
<lb/>defunct I shall if you please buy this watch 
<lb/>that is coming, and which he says he put 
<lb/>down by mistake for the silver case. He was 
<lb/>ordered to go by way of the Cape in charge of 
<lb/>botanical collections and the chronometers<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>When the Lyra took him away from <placeName>Quilimane</placeName>
<lb/>they met a ship going to the Cape he put <add place="above">ten of</add> the boxes 
<lb/>aboard but would not go himself. Went towards 
<lb/><placeName>Aden</placeName> and came to grief. We hear that five of the boxes 
<lb/>were lately seen at <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>- to <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk's</persName> great sorrow 
<lb/><space extent="7" unit="words"/>unaddressed. </p>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_001702_0005"/><!--pb/@n='3r'-->
<lb/><p>In connection with the thermometer, I 
<lb/>learned what, though probably well known to you 
<lb/>was perfectly new to me - the glass tube and ivory 
<lb/>scale expand and contract so as to ensure fracture<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It was a neat pocket instrument in a silver 
<lb/>case by <persName>Dixey</persName> of New Bond St. and had a small 
<lb/>compass on the lid. It was broken opposite to 
<lb/>the bulge inwards of this compass and I concluded 
<lb/>that pressure against my side had done it - sent 
<lb/>for another, it came out in a wooden case 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">and broken too</hi><figure><!--<graphic url="LETT1247.png"/>--><figDesc/></figure> the ivory scale had 
<lb/>contracted by the heat and the glass expanded and 
<lb/>fracture was the result. I suppose glass scale blue 
<lb/>with white figures would be the proper thing. I 
<lb/>valued the instrument lost on account of its 
<lb/>being a present from <persName>Sir Culling E. Earldley</persName>, but 
<lb/>the watch is of much more value, and needing 
<lb/>it if you let me know the price I shall add it 
<lb/>to the money I have on hand for current expenses 
<lb/>or give you an order on my banker for the 
<lb/>amount. </p>
<lb/><p>A very fine sextant was bought out by 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName>. It is easily adjusted to index Error 0″ 
<lb/>but above 100¨ degrees two images of the sun 
<lb/>are formed one from the surface of the 
<lb/>glass mirror and another from the quicksilver 
<lb/>behind. This would have been no great 
<lb/>disadvantage as we should have used it 
<lb/>only at lower altitudes, but the mercury 
<lb/>being in the same box leaked and an 
<lb/>amalgam was formed on the arc which 
<lb/>renders it illegible in the evenings. <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Maclear</persName>
<lb/>will send you a tracing of the Lake with 
<lb/>my work there. The West side is a remarkable 
<lb/>succession of bays one after the other up to 
<lb/>the North. No Latitude was taken after I left 
<lb/>the boat. Fever was among them. </p>

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001702_0006"/><!--pb/@n='3v'-->
<lb/><p>I earnestly hope that the gins sent are not saw 
<lb/>gins, <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Clegg</persName> says they deteriorate the cotton. 
<lb/>We send our bit of cotton to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Turner M.P.</persName>
<lb/>for Manchester. We wish to secure a good character 
<lb/>for our cotton but the gin we had would not clean 
<lb/>it though improvements were tried by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>I hope too the press is an hydraulic one. The 
<lb/>others are so enormously heavy. If you saw 
<lb/>them yourself I am sure it will be hydraulic<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The opinions of such men as <persName>Sir James 
<lb/><choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>lack, </persName><persName>Sir James Liddell</persName> and  <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Bryson</persName> are not 
<lb/>to be despised, though not a medical man you 
<lb/>will easily understand that two of the ingredients 
<lb/>of the pills are incompatible, that is, they are 
<lb/>believed to decompose each other when brought 
<lb/>into combination. Calomel &amp; quinine should 
<lb/>never be combined in a scientific prescription<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But Opium and sugar of lead are just as 
<w>in-<lb break="no"/>compatible</w> and yet they are the ingredients of one 
<lb/>of the best pills we have for dysentery and stand 
<lb/>in the Pharmacopoea. It is believed that they 
<lb/>do dissolve each other &amp; form a compound 
<lb/>which is eminently useful. You must 
<w>under-<lb break="no"/>stand</w> however that I do not for a moment 
<lb/>justify unscientific prescriptions. </p>
<lb/><p>We were all taught to reduce the fever before 
<lb/>giving quinine. <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> MacWilliam</persName> followed this 
<lb/>rule rigo<del type="strikethrough">u</del>rously in 1841. But in 1850 I took my 
<lb/>children with me to <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> intending to 
<lb/>settle with <persName>Sebituane</persName>. Fever knocked down two 
<lb/>of them and I was led by feelings which 
<lb/>you can well understand to give quinine before 
<lb/>the fever was reduced, and with such good effect 
<lb/>I have followed the plan ever since. Quinine 
<lb/>is the great curative agent for fever, the pills 
<lb/>are but half the cure. We give the quinine until  
<lb/>cinchonism is produced, and with the pure quinine 
<lb/>that is effected by a few doses after the pills. </p>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001702_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/><p>I took seven Johanna men on trial and 
<lb/>dismissed six Europeans into the Wasp. We find 
<lb/>that the Johanna men are better than Kroomen 
<lb/>they never take fever and work well. They have the 
<lb/>same wages viz. a fraction under one shilling per 
<lb/>day. We shall try and get a dozen more and 
<lb/>do with as few Europeans as possible. An 
<lb/>engineer, two stokers - a carpenter - a cook and 
<lb/>two quartermasters seem indispensible. At 
<lb/>present we have two seamen besides. I trust 
<lb/>you have renewed the request to the new 
<lb/>Admiral to render us assistance, we need a 
<lb/>good many things from the dockyard. Slops 
<lb/>taken up by officers are paid to me and I 
<lb/>put the money to the balance on hand for 
<lb/>current expenses. Those taken up by the men 
<lb/>are placed against them when leaving. I have 
<lb/>£50 on hand now and this will do I believe 
<lb/>for all incidental expenses for next year. I 
<lb/>have to pay the wages of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May's</persName> interpreter 
<lb/>yet and purchase calicoes for wages to the 
<lb/>people to be employed in road making. I suppose 
<lb/><persName>Sir George Grey</persName> will have sent home a bill 
<lb/>for two mules and two scotch carts I asked 
<lb/>him to send us to carry the steamer across. </p>
<lb/><p>We had bought a number of hoes for 
<lb/>the road at about 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi> each. They are of native 
<lb/>manufacture entirely. Many of the tools you 
<lb/>have sent will be very useful and I think 
<lb/>quite sufficient for our purpose as we 
<lb/>go out from the river and thereby avoid 
<lb/>many gullies and hills. It will be a curve 
<lb/>of some 50 miles long - 1200 feet of altitude 
<lb/>must be got up. The West is far easier 
<lb/>than the East bank, where so many spurs 
<lb/>come down from the highlands. We shall have 
<lb/>plenty of workmen if we have calico - a cubit 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001702_0008"/><!--pb/@n='4v'--> 
<lb/>a day is handsome pay to them. When we came 
<lb/>the first time we could not get a guide without 
<lb/>the greatest trouble - now we can get fifty in 
<lb/>five hours notice. As soon as we get on the 
<lb/>Lake not an hour will be lost before settling 
<lb/>the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> question. The Portuguese have 
<lb/>built a fort near the mouth of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> to enrich 
<lb/>themselves with the dues from the cotton trade 
<lb/>while others work hard to render the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>as devoid of population as the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. So 
<lb/>I am quite alive to the expediency of securing 
<lb/>another outlet<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Between ourselves I am rather mortified 
<lb/>to find that missionaries went to fight 
<lb/>the Ajawa. I would not have gone <add place="above">at first</add> had I in 
<lb/>the least suspected an attack, but used 
<lb/>messages and presents before venturing 
<lb/>among them. The head chief <persName>Chisunze</persName> of <add place="above">of Manganja</add>
<lb/>came afterwards and urged our going to 
<lb/>drive the Ajawa entirely away. I was 
<lb/>spokesman and gave him to understand 
<lb/>in unmistakeable terms that we did 
<lb/>not come to fight nor would we use 
<lb/>our arms except in self defence as in the 
<lb/>case which had just occurred. The bishop 
<lb/>agreed to all I uttered, and enumerated 
<lb/>the points inculcated as religion - peace 
<lb/>unity - no slave selling - industry and 
<lb/>civilization. I did not know that 
<lb/>I had touched on all these points, but 
<lb/>after we left he went, assaulted the Ajawa 
<lb/>burned their town and took a number 
<lb/>of captives - they are now our enemies 
<lb/>for life. We could have easily got over 
<lb/>the first affair for all acknowledge that 
<lb/>the party that begins the fight has all the 
<lb/>guilt, but I fear we shall never be friends

<lb/>but though they were quite willing to remain 
<lb/>in the event of accident to the boat we should have 
<lb/>perished. It was only fear of our numbers that 
<lb/>induced civility where slaving goes on. In the sphere 
<lb/>of the dhow's operations the people were worse 
<lb/>than I ever saw Africans. We were robbed twice 
<lb/>(the first time to me in Africa) - and one of the

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">We got a couple of whalers with the Ma Robert, built by a man in <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> 
<lb/>they were of first rate quality and only now are worn out - stem &amp; stern of same 
<lb/>shape. The Nyassa boat was made purposely very thin - she is hoisted up to a 
<lb/>tree above the cataracts - and we have only one boat now - could you 
<lb/>send us out two whalers - ? made strong with 
<lb/>lockers behind<reg>.</reg></p><anchor xml:id="p.6r"/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">P. S. We once in coming up the 
<lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice><placeName>Shire</placeName> in the Ma Robert killed a number 
<lb/>of elephants but got the tusks of three 
<lb/>only - four tusks were worth selling 
<lb/>and I sent them to <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>
<lb/>and got £50 for them. We used 
<lb/>Government wine &amp; brandy for 
<lb/>quinine as long as it lasted - then 
<lb/>brought more for the same purpose 
<lb/>and in addition some private mess 
<lb/>stores - which we did not use except 
<lb/>on Sundays and special occasions<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>Baines</persName> confessed to making away 
<lb/>with half the wine - offered to pay 
<lb/>for it but when we were making 
<lb/>up the account denied taking 
<lb/>it. I once came in upon him 
<lb/>regaling three of his convict friends 
<lb/>the Portuguese with our wine. 
<lb/>We shared the loss. As well 
<lb/>as other losses by the same 
<lb/>man. Will it be wrong in 
<lb/>me to repay <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>, <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Livingstone</persName>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName>, <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Thornton</persName><del type="strikethrough">&amp; self</del>
<lb/>our losses out of this £50. 
<lb/>I think it will suffice to pay 
<lb/>all our private mess bills 
<lb/>together for we were very moderate - 
<lb/>if you say yes there is no 
<lb/>objection to it I shall do it. </p>

<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Gedye</persName> begs me to tell you 
<lb/>that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> payment 
<lb/>for keeping stores he will esteem 
<lb/>it a favour if you grant him 
<lb/>the same. I can say that he is 
<lb/>well worthy of it - attends carefully 
<lb/>to his duty, and during our absence 
<lb/>had entire charge of the ship. He 
<lb/>will occupy the same position 
<lb/>when we are at work on the 
<lb/>boat and carrying the steamer<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Indeed he took charge of the stores 
<lb/>on the way out &amp; not <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> May</persName>. </p>
<lb/><p>A naval officer named <persName>Burlton</persName>
<lb/>applied for employment. I declined 
<lb/>his services. A mixed naval &amp; civil 
<lb/>expedition cannot possibly work. This was 
<lb/>unmistakably evident in <persName>May's</persName> case. He 
<lb/>was assured of absolute command of the 
<lb/>Pioneer even if <persName>Kirk</persName> succeeded <add place="above">me</add> until the 
<lb/>pleasure of the Foreign office were known. 
<lb/>"No, No, he would not play second fiddle &amp;c. 
<lb/>And this the man of whom you said to me 
<lb/>before leaving <placeName>England</placeName>. "If any of your 
<lb/>officers set up their backs as <persName>May</persName> has done 
<lb/>in the <placeName>Niger</placeName>, you will be perfectly justified 
<lb/>in leaving him on the first island." A master 
<lb/>of one of the river steamers might do but with 
<lb/>all due respect to the service I think that no 
<lb/>naval officer will do unless it is converted 
<lb/>into a naval expedition entirely. </p>
<lb/><p>We use quinine wine out of deference to the 
<lb/>opinions of greater men - we have plenty now and 
<lb/>will send for it to the Cape as we need it. </p>
