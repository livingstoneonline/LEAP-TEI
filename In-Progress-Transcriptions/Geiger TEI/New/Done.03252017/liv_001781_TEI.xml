<lb/>
				<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I wrote you before of the 
<lb/>late attempts of the <persName>Governor 
<lb/>of Mozambique</persName> to extend their 
<lb/>boundary to the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> - 
<lb/>but feel so anxious that you 
<lb/>should know about it that 
<lb/>in case my previous letter 
<lb/>may have miscarried I trouble 
<lb/>you again.</p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Governor <add place="above">G.C.</add> said to <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Rae</persName> that he was not very well 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> up at <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> when 
<lb/>we went up to <hi rend="underline">"extend their 
<lb/>territories"</hi> the ipsissima verba 
<lb/>he employed. He wished the 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001781_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> Sultan to agree to <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> being 
<lb/>called the boundary instead of 
<lb/><placeName>Cape Delgado</placeName> but <persName>Col Rigby's</persName>
<lb/>influence prevailed to prevent 
<lb/>the weak Sultan from agreeing 
<lb/>to what is evidently intended to 
<lb/>forestall us. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he word "extend" 
<lb/>shews what the best informed 
<lb/>Portuguese think of our friends 
<lb/><persName>Arrowsmith</persName> &amp; <persName>Macqueen's</persName> dicta 
<lb/>on the Portuguese boundary<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The <persName>Governor General</persName> did not 
<lb/>believe that <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> belonged 
<lb/>even nominally to his nation. 
<lb/><persName>Captain Wilson</persName> had the very 
<lb/>same version as <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName>
<lb/>and indeed I got it first from 
<lb/>the captain. Now don<reg>'</reg>t omit 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001781_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>to tell me whether I am to take 
<lb/>possession of our discoveries 
<lb/>formally in the Queen's name. 
<lb/>Our flag was the first that ever 
<lb/>floated on <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName>. 
<lb/>I have asked <persName>Lord John Russell</persName>
<lb/>the question but possibly it 
<lb/>may not be deemed expedient 
<lb/>to authorize me though no 
<lb/>fault will be found if I do 
<lb/>it, as if spontaneously. </p>
<lb/><p>Not a word has been said 
<lb/>about our freeing the captives.
<lb/>All the Portuguese are as civil 
<lb/>as ever. Ten slaves whom 
<lb/>I employed in the belief that they 
<lb/>were free men &amp; did not discover 
<lb/>the mistake till we were up the 
<lb/><persName>Shire</persName> entered into the work of freeing 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001781_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>the captives with great zest. I paid 
<lb/>them handsomely and as they had the 
<lb/>muskets of the Tette people from whom 
<lb/>we took the Manganja captives<reg>.</reg> I feared 
<lb/>that they might suffer but nothing 
<lb/>was done and their master <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Ferr√£o</persName>
<lb/>of <placeName>Senna</placeName> whose people they were wrote 
<lb/>to say that he was glad his people had 
<lb/>been useful. His people can scarcely 
<lb/>be called slaves for he always pays 
<lb/>them for any work they do. </p>
<lb/><p>But the Portuguese have got a hair 
<lb/>in our neck. The Gorgon's people 
<lb/>on returning from this mis-behaved 
<lb/>when drunk at Vianna's. I apologized 
<lb/>most amply and so did <persName>Captain 
<lb/>Wilson</persName> and Vianna would scarcely 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> an explanation. "It was only 
<lb/>a little wine" &amp;c. But the <persName>Governor of 
<lb/>Quillimane</persName> wrote me an official letter 
<lb/>from the report of another than Vianna 
<lb/>but trusts that the Portuguese officials 
<lb/>and I will continue in the same friendly 
<lb/>terms as we have always been. I have 
<lb/>to explain to the Foreign office in case he sends 
<lb/>the affair home. I am &amp;c <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
