<lb/>like "Quackery" I said little about it more 
<lb/>than is mentioned in the "Missionary Travels" 
<lb/>But when we lately arrived at <placeName>Victoria 
<lb/>Falls</placeName> we heard for the first time that a party 
<lb/>of <placeName>London</placeName> Missionaries had arrived <del type="strikethrough">at</del>
<lb/>and four out of six Europeans perished 
<lb/>at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>: this caused us unfeigned 
<lb/>sorrow. We did not know of their 
<w>move-<lb break="no"/>ments</w> except that at the <placeName>Cape</placeName> the 
<w>News-<lb break="no"/>papers</w> spoke of them as in "connection with 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> Expedition," and they had gone 
<lb/>inland. With all the vexatious delays we 
<lb/>have experienced we might by straining a 
<lb/>point have been there before them, and rendered 
<lb/>that medical aid which they seem so much to 
<lb/>have needed. It must have been inadvertence 
<lb/>that led to neither <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Tidman</persName> nor my dear 
<lb/>friend <persName>Helmore</persName> saying a word to me about 
<lb/>a mission in which I feel so deep an interest </p>

<lb/><p>I have ventured to advise <persName>John Moffat</persName> in the 
<lb/>event of not being allowed to teach the people of 
<lb/><placeName>Mosilikatze</placeName> freely to go to the <placeName>Makololo</placeName> by a straight 
<lb/>course to <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName>. The Makololo are 
<lb/>perishing of fever themselves and would willingly 
<lb/>leave the swamps of <placeName>Linyanti</placeName> for the Highland 
<lb/>where in passing we actually saw hoar frost 
<lb/>and a little ice, provided one of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat</persName>'s 
<lb/>family were with them. They look kindly to 
<lb/><persName>Helmore</persName> but wished to get acquainted &amp; hence 
<lb/>the delay which proved so fatal. I have also 
<lb/>reminded him of your proposal to make the 
<lb/>christians at home aware of his efforts and 
<lb/>secure a share of their sympathies by the 
<lb/>channel which <hi rend="underline">"Evangelical Christendom"</hi>
<lb/>affords. Some one sent us copies for March 
<lb/>April <add place="above">May &amp;</add> June - They are the first I have seen &amp; 
<lb/>it appears to be the largest hearted &amp; ablest 
<lb/>religious Periodical going. I did not like the 
<lb/>Evangelical alliance when its only object 
<lb/>seemed to be for Christians to meet &amp; clap each 
<lb/>others backs. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut it has now great objects 
<lb/>and works to do, and I wish it cordially 
<lb/>all success<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>We are very much pleased &amp; thankful 
<lb/>to hear of the wonderful Revivals which are 
<lb/>taking place in so many parts of our native 
<lb/>land. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Lord pour out his spirit on

<lb/>It is with great delight that I hail the new

<lb/>It seems to come up to my idea of what 
<lb/>a mission ought to be, and do in <placeName>Africa</placeName><reg>.</reg>

<lb/>I pray our Heavenly Father that he may draw 
<lb/>out the Church of England and make that 
<lb/>great and rich body feel that it stands com
<lb/>mitted to the final extermination of the slave 
<lb/>trade by the introduction of commerce &amp; 
<lb/>the gospel of christ into the centre of the slave 
<lb/>market. It is He who has drawn so many 
<lb/>into the movement and as it is his own 
<lb/>work we have thus a pledge that he will 
<lb/>carry it on. I have been applied to for 
<lb/>information by the Committees, and have 
<lb/>recommended a steamer, and but a small 
<lb/>party at the outset. I have not failed to 
<lb/>warn them against an irritability produced 
<lb/>by the climate possibly by malaria as it often 
<lb/>though not always precedes an attack of fever<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We put down the feeling of being slighted or 
<lb/>insulted as one of the symptoms of coming 
<lb/>fever. The remedy for fever comes very 
<lb/>opportunely for this mission. I am excessively 
<lb/>grieved that the <placeName>London</placeName> Missionaries did 
<lb/>not (probably) know it. Now for the Society 
<lb/>of Friends. As soon as the Mission is 
<lb/>fairly set agoing I mean to make an appeal 
<lb/>to them for cooperation in helping on the lawful 
<lb/>trade. What say you to that? I sympathize 
<lb/>with you all in the loss of your dear mother and 
<lb/>sister. They are home. O that we could feel 
<lb/>that the haven which they have reached really 
<lb/>really is our home. I always feel as if I had 
<lb/>a work to do here and the heart is not set 
<lb/>on things above as it ought. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Lord bless 
<lb/>these events to us all. Remember me most

<lb/><p>As we have a daughter more than was expected 
<lb/>when the Settlement for the children was made 
<lb/>can a clause be added giving her the share

<lb/><p>I am not aware who my injudicious

<lb/>sweet on being shamefully treated by <persName>Macgregor</persName>
<lb/><persName>Laird</persName> &amp; <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>. Nor I suppose did <persName>Sir 
<lb/>John Franklin</persName> when he discovered his preserved 
<lb/>offal. I have good reason to believe that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Laird</persName> behaved badly also to the great Niger Expedition. 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Vogel</persName> the botanists cabin was as wet as ours, 
<lb/>and the ships were left ashore near <placeName>Bathurst</placeName>
<lb/>though the cost was enormous. A seaman in our 
<lb/>employ saw that one of them was broken right 
<lb/>through the middle! And a gentleman high in the 
<lb/>Admiralty said to me "He (<persName>Macgregor Laird</persName>)" treated 
<lb/>us very shabbily" He won<reg>'</reg>t do so to any one else 
<lb/>and he would not have treated us so had 
<lb/>the officers of the Niger Expedition spoken out boldly. 
<lb/>I was unfortunate in having anything to do with 
<lb/>the naval officers <persName>Bedingfeld</persName> &amp; <persName>Gordon</persName>. Both quarrelled 
<lb/>with <persName>Captain Duncan</persName> of the <term type="boat">Pearl</term> and I had orders 
<lb/>to see that "<persName>Duncan</persName> was not interfered with in his 
<lb/>command by any naval officer ". On the third public 
<lb/>alteraction before his crew I interfered by saying <add place="above">to B</add> "we 
<lb/>must have no more of these public altercations" private 
<lb/>remonstrance had failed, and I got <persName>Bedingfelds</persName>
<lb/>resignation next day and <persName>Gordon</persName>'s spite fifteen
