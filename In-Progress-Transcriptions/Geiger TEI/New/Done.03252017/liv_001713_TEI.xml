<lb/>letter since 1858 a short time ago by 
<lb/>one of the missionaries who came 
<lb/>up this river in a canoe without 
<lb/>knowing a word of the language 
<lb/>or a bit of the way. It is not 
<lb/>likely that the High church mission 
<lb/>will be <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> with favour 
<lb/>by any other sect. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir pretensions

<lb/>come to. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is nobody either to 
<lb/>oppose or laugh at their puerilities 
<lb/>and the Africans will not be 
<lb/>led by anything but the love 
<lb/>of Christ. A Roman catholic 
<lb/>mission far up <placeName>the Nile</placeName> paid 
<lb/>the people to come to prayers and

<lb/>that the missionaries were all dead. </p>
<lb/><p>Our cotton grows wild and when 
<lb/>well planted continues to yield for 
<lb/>several years, with only a weeding 
<lb/>now &amp; then. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he heartbreaking toil 
<lb/>necessary in <placeName>America</placeName> is not needed 
<lb/>here. We have no frosts to endanger the 
<lb/>crop and can buy it for a good deal 
<lb/>less than a penny per pound. We bought 
<lb/>300 lbs of clean cotton as a trial, giving 
<lb/>a foot of calico not worth a halfpenny 
<lb/>for several pounds. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his was not 
<lb/>at the period of the cotton crop either. 
<lb/>But we must have an outlet of our 
<lb/>own away from Portuguese custom 
<lb/>houses and hence our efforts to open 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> - from <placeName>Rovuma.</placeName>
<lb/>It is over 200 miles long - from 
<lb/>20 to 50 or more miles broad, and 
<lb/>exceedingly deep. We shall bend all 
<lb/>our energies to placing a steamer on 
<lb/>it this year and I pray God that 
<lb/>I may be permitted to effect this great 
<lb/>service for then we have highlands 
<lb/>all round <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. It is surrounded 
<lb/>by mountains, and Europeans 
<lb/>can live well up there. I hope then 
<lb/>that our countrymen may both 
<lb/>benefit themselves and the Africans </p>
