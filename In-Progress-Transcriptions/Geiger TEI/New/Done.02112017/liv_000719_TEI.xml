<lb/><p rend="right"><space extent="4" unit="words"/><placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> 20<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> March 1851</p>
<lb/>
<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/><persName><unclear cert="medium">Hendrick</unclear></persName> the son of <persName>Paul</persName> called this 
<lb/>evening to inform us of his intention to proceed towards 
<lb/><placeName>Kuruman</placeName> on monday next. This is the first opportunity 
<lb/>we have had since our return to <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName>. We met <persName>Moyle</persName>
<lb/>at the great <unclear cert="low">Choai</unclear> but did not remain anytime with him<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>His statements as to the manner of poor <persName>Robinson's</persName> death 
<lb/>are not uniform but it would appear to have been 
<lb/>an attack of cramp rather that the odious hug of 
<lb/>an alligator. He was the only spectator and they were 
<lb/>not on good terms so <persName>Moyle</persName> would not be sorry to 
<lb/>have the whole immense stock of arms &amp; ammunition 
<lb/>at his own disposal. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he discrepancy to which I refer 
<lb/>was having told <persName>Wilson</persName>, <persName>Robinson</persName> only gave a moan 
<lb/>and gradually sunk. To me he said 'He uttered a horrid 
<lb/>shriek or roar<reg>'</reg>. How futile Gov<hi rend="sup">t</hi> regulations are. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>had more powder &amp;c. than they could take in &amp; had to 
<lb/>leave a large quantity at a <placeName>Kalihari</placeName> village beyond the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> and still more in coming out for their 
<lb/>next trip - besides selling 100lbs powder muskets &amp;c to 
<lb/><persName>Wilson</persName> here.</p>
<lb/><p><unclear cert="medium"><persName>Sentuhe</persName></unclear> pretended he was totally opposed to the Griquas 
<lb/>assisting the Boers to plunder the English trader who 
<lb/>was robbed near his place but when we came here 
<lb/>we learned that <persName>Sechele</persName> had offered to repel them 
<lb/>out of the country. To this <unclear cert="medium"><persName>Sentuhe</persName></unclear> would not 
<lb/>assent because "I would have no one to fight for 
<lb/>me in case of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> attacking me, after the  

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000719_0002"/><!--pb/@n='14v'-->
<lb/>Griquas were expelled." <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey usually go on the principle 
<lb/>that there is no truth in the country and perhaps they are not 
<lb/>far wrong. <persName><unclear cert="low">Flomelau</unclear></persName> seemed to be doing pretty well 
<lb/>in the midst of difficulties. I said I believe <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>
<lb/>had not time to write you. He replied - O he never does 
<lb/>although I write to him - and would be very glad of an 
<lb/>epistle occasionally.</p>
<lb/><p>Here we seem to have had plenty of rain but 
<lb/>the crops look more miserable than ever we saw them<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he soil does not retain the moisture. Most of the 
<lb/>people look extremely wretched, and the dreary prospect 
<lb/>before them is enough to make them run away<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> thinks that the part <add place="above">8 or 10 miles</add> higher up the <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName>
<lb/>called <placeName>Limaoe</placeName> is a better location but most of the 
<lb/>people consider that he is quite mistaken. He offers 
<lb/>to build our house and <persName><unclear cert="low">Mebaloes</unclear></persName> without expense 
<lb/>if we go thither. But I have no heart to remove 
<lb/>anywhere, there being no encouragement as to 
<lb/>teaching and water. A movement must take place 
<lb/>some where by both us &amp; them but I cannot see 
<lb/>it to be my duty to follow them in these circumstances<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We shall try the North - being shut up to it. <choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd 
<lb/>if spared may give them another trial at some 
<lb/>future time. If unsuccessful elsewhere the wise 
<lb/>ones who bestow any thought upon us will say 
<lb/>"Ah, just as we thought". "We knew it would be so"<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>If successful they will forget that they ever thought 
<lb/>about us. I have both hopes and fears. I question 
<lb/>whether any modern missionary has be situated so 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000719_0003"/><!--pb/@n='15r'-->
<lb/>peculiarly as I am. And the model missionary has yet to 
<lb/>be born. So I have just to try and do what seems most for 
<lb/>the Divine glory and trust he will purify and accept my 
<lb/>service.</p>
<lb/><p>I suppose <persName>Robert</persName> is by this time with you. We have 
<lb/>not heard a syllable about you since we left. And we 
<lb/>have no news of any sort up here. <persName>S. Edwards</persName> brought 
<lb/>up a young man with him who can work well at the 
<lb/>forge. He comes professedly for birds. <unclear cert="low">name</unclear><persName>Leland 
<lb/>Wilson</persName> is better but not yet quite well. Could not go 
<lb/>out for want of oxen. A letter came here for 
<lb/>me. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilson</persName> inclosed it in another and sent it 
<lb/>over to <persName>Hans Sedras</persName><reg>'</reg> son<reg>.</reg> I saw him at <placeName>Motito</placeName>
<lb/>but he did not deliver it. Perhaps he has forgot until 
<lb/>he saw you. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here was a newspaper with it<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><persName>Sam.</persName> brought one of the boxes for us from <placeName>Philipolis</placeName><reg>,</reg>
<lb/>there was another but his waggon was laden up 
<lb/>to the tent. I have had a dream that you gave me 
<lb/>a hand saw. Is it one of those that come true? 
<lb/>Hope to <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> a copy of Deuteronomy before we go. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he children are all pretty well. <persName>Mary</persName> is better than 
<lb/>when at <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>. Kind regards to you all 
<lb/>not forgetting <persName>Robert</persName>. He is surely with you now<reg>.</reg></p>
