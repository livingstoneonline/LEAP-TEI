<lb/>
<lb/><p>My Lord</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="1" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I herewith return the Church 
<lb/>Missionary Intelligencer with many 
<lb/>thanks. I was not previously aware 
<lb/>of its existence, having been disappointed 
<lb/>in the expectation of seeing a similar 
<lb/>publication given to the public in 1850. 
<lb/>It was projected by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Taylor</persName> the author 
<lb/>of the "Natural history of Enthusiasm" near 
<lb/>whom I lived while he was in <placeName>Essex</placeName>. 
<lb/>I tried to do my best for it by giving 
<lb/>the only detailed account of the discovery 
<lb/>of <placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> I ever wrote but it 
<lb/>never <choice><sic>say</sic><corr>saw</corr></choice> daylight. I hope this work 
<lb/>will continue to be carried on with spirit 
<lb/>as it seems well adapted to be extensively 
<lb/>useful<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he accounts given by <persName>Rev S. Crowther</persName>
<lb/>are deeply interesting and his experience 
<lb/>on the banks of the <placeName>Niger</placeName> strike me as 
<lb/>closely resembling my own, among tribes 
<lb/>of the true Negro family in the centre of the 
<lb/>country. Their friendly disposition to the 
<lb/>white man (and where we are known 
<lb/>to the Englishman as the best specimen 
<lb/>of the white man) - their love of barter, 
<lb/>and strong religious tendencies, constitute 
<lb/>very interesting features in their character 
<lb/>and I hope that God will lead His people 
<lb/>to send them that gospel by which the 
<lb/>poor dwellers in the wilderness will 
<lb/>be made to bow down before Him. 
<lb/>In ascending the <placeName>Leambye (Zambese)</placeName>
<lb/>to the country of the true negroes called 
<lb/><placeName>Londa</placeName> I rescued eighteen captives 
<lb/>made by the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> in a foray a short

<lb/>time before and returned them to their 
<lb/>families which I guess was not a bad 
<lb/>passport for the first Englishman 
<lb/>they had ever seen. In returning, 
<lb/>two chiefs <persName>Masiko</persName> and <persName>Mboela</persName>, brothers 
<lb/>by the same father but different mothers 
<lb/>were on the point of fighting and I 
<lb/>believe actually had a skirmish but 
<lb/>both sent embassies to me the one 
<lb/>blaming the other <add place="above">for</add> the breach of the peace 
<lb/>which I had enjoined. One party followed 
<lb/>us down the river about 100 miles to 
<lb/>tell me that <persName>Masiko</persName> had been attacked 
<lb/>by <persName>Mboela</persName> but had beaten him off with 
<lb/>loss though <persName>Masiko</persName> had offered to refer 
<lb/>the dispute to me as arbitrator. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he

<lb/>(the commonality) were so delighted they all 
<lb/>ran down the river and gambolled about 
<lb/>like porpoises for joy at the prospect 
<lb/>of living in peace. This is very much 
<lb/>like that which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Crowther</persName> describes. 
<lb/>There are some notices about <placeName>Londa</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/><placeName>Angola</placeName> in the last number of the Royal 
<lb/>Geographical Society in the possession 
<lb/>of <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beke</persName> which you may feel 
<lb/>an interest in reading<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I have engaged a passage to <placeName>Galle</placeName> in 
<lb/>the "England" steamer. I hope you will be 
<lb/>able to preach to the very fine crew of the 
<lb/>Frolic on your way to <placeName>Secheylles</placeName> which 
<lb/>was more than I could do on our way 
<lb/>here, and that you will be successful 
<lb/>in your mission there. May it be granted 
<lb/>that you return with <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ryan</persName> &amp; family 
<lb/>in renewed health to this deeply interesting 
<lb/>field of labour. Your Lordship's servant </p>
