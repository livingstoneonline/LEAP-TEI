<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Robert</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="5" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>A considerable time has elapsed since we 
<lb/>had the pleasure of hearing from you. What is the matter, you 
<lb/>certainly never were compelled to listen for months to the 
<lb/>wearisome round of news, maka hela, of this country 
<lb/>enough to make me pant with feverish desire for 
<lb/>something from the world <unclear cert="medium">sick</unclear> in order to realize 
<lb/>the <del type="strikethrough"><unclear cert="low">f</unclear></del> refreshment good news imparts. It is now a 
<lb/>long time since we heard from the <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> side and all 
<lb/>we hear from the natives they well characterize as lies only 
<lb/>there is so little truth in public report here a native 
<lb/>always begins by saying "there are no news. none at all 
<lb/>We have heard a few lies only." And then beginning their 
<lb/>story it is sure to be rumours of war - contentions 
<lb/>between tribes or something so vague we can scarcely 
<lb/>make head or tail of it. Why dont you write 
<lb/>more frequently then? The Penny Post has made 
<lb/>you all so expert in the use of the pen you have 
<lb/>no excuse.</p>
<lb/><p>We heard last week from an authentic source 
<lb/>that <persName>Sekhomi</persName> the chief of the <term type="tribe">BamangWerto</term> had 
<lb/>put a large party of <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> to death. They came 
<lb/>last year to reside with him and being dissatisfied 
<lb/>with his government began to flee to a neighbouring 
<lb/>chief when to prevent the whole following that example 
<lb/>those who remained were indiscriminately massacred 
<lb/>A little more than ten months ago <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> sent 23 
<lb/>men to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwerto</term> for tribute. <persName>Sekhomi</persName>
<lb/>laid an <unclear cert="high">ambuscade</unclear> for them and the poor fellows 
<lb/>being hemmed in in a deep valley I well know 
<lb/>were everyone cut off: A gentleman lately saw 
<lb/>their bones. I do not wish to harrow up 
<lb/>your feelings by these stories But when I 
<lb/>mention the fact of the destruction of the men </p>
<ab>
<lb/><!--written up side of p. 1--><persName>Ralph Lindsay</persName> Esq<hi rend="sup underline">re</hi> has contributed Â£ 10..10 for another but I dont know anything 
<lb/>about him Do you know him? does he intend to continue the sum? I am at a loss 
</ab>

<ab>
<lb/><!--up side of p.2-->for want of proper information <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Philip</persName> only notified the simple fact and no 
<lb/>more about it. If you know him I should like to hold some communication <gap agent="damage"/>
</ab>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><persName>Mosilikatze</persName> and likewise that the <term type="tribe">Bamangwerto</term> have 
<lb/>subsequently "lifted" some of that gentleman's cattle 
<lb/>and no attempt has been made to punish them, I give 
<lb/>you th information as evidence that <persName>Mosilikatzes</persName>
<lb/>power is on the wane. And we probably will be allowed 
<lb/>to carry on our operations without any hindrance 
<lb/>from him. He was once the great obstacle in the 
<lb/>way of the evangelization of the interior. God in His 
<lb/>providence has removed him out of the way and there is 
<lb/>now every probability that this region will become 
<lb/>the abode of righteousness and peace. A large tribe 
<lb/>of <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> or <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="high">Joolarhs</unclear></term> lives about 10 days East of <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>they have fought three times with <persName>Mosilikatse</persName> and <unclear cert="low">with</unclear>
<lb/>more or less success each time. He is now at a great 
<lb/>distance from us. And long may it remain so. He 
<lb/>has too long been the cause of lamentation cursing &amp; sorrow 
<lb/>here. But I must return to the point for which I 
<lb/>introduced the deeds of <persName>Sekhomi</persName>, viz, to <unclear cert="high">give</unclear>
<lb/>a deed of <unclear cert="high"><persName>Mosheu</persName></unclear> of whom you may have read 
<lb/>in either <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffats</persName> work or speeches. A village 
<lb/>about 12 or 14 miles from <placeName>Mabotsa</placeName> was lately 
<lb/>ransacked by a party of <term type="tribe">Korannas</term> from the 
<lb/><placeName>Vaal river</placeName>. The whole of the cattle &amp; goods of the 
<lb/>people were swept off, and a few lives were lost 
<lb/>When the marauders reached <unclear cert="high">their</unclear> residence next to 
<lb/>that of <persName>Mosheu</persName>, their horses &amp; <unclear cert="high">selves</unclear> being all tired 
<lb/>by the long journey (nearly 200 miles) <persName>Mosheu</persName>
<lb/>lost no time in ordering them to restore everything 
<lb/>and as he is a man of authority among them 
<lb/>they do not dare to refuse obedience to what <persName>Mosheu</persName>
<lb/>told them was the Divine will they made restitution 
<lb/><unclear cert="high"><del type="strikethrough">for</del></unclear> they had stolen And <persName>Mosheu</persName> calling on the 
<lb/>owners of the cattle and goods delivered the 
<lb/>whole into their hands. He would not even accept 
<lb/>a present for what he had done</p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">I have heard the above particulars from the natives, I am 
<lb/>not yet aware of the whole of the facts But what a 
<lb/>contrast to <persName>Sekhomi</persName>, I have conversed with <persName>Mosheu</persName>
<lb/>and found him a simple humble minded Christian 
<lb/>When I reproved <persName>Sekhomi</persName> for having murdered his 
<lb/>brother he replied "But he killed me first" referring 
<lb/>to the fact of his brother having broken allegiance 
<lb/>And rose up and went off to another part of the town 
<lb/>But afterwards enquiring whether it were true that I saw 
<lb/>all who were dead <unclear cert="high"><del type="strikethrough">alive</del></unclear> still in existence, I replied yes &amp; 
<lb/>you will see your brother and stand to be judged by 
<lb/>his side. He replied "maka hela" his only. <unclear cert="low">Let your</unclear>

<lb/>royal highness <persName>Prince Al.</persName> &amp; not he but a king stand 
<lb/>up to his knees in water and two persons scrubbing 
<lb/>his royal person all over. As a preliminary to 
<lb/>his washing his wardrobe himself. It takes a whole 
<lb/>day to wash an old red coat and a few other <unclear cert="high">duds</unclear> which
