<lb/><p rend="no-indent">ones are patched up by <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName>. If I 
<lb/>had ever contemplated having anything 
<lb/>to do with steamers I should certainly 
<lb/>have studied steam in a systematic way. 
<lb/><persName>Hardisty</persName> I can now see behaved in a 
<lb/>most shameful way with the engines - 
<lb/>nuts tied up with bits of string instead of 
<lb/>being mended - and the journals all so 
<lb/>neglected that, though while in the river 
<lb/>and at rest we do not make an inch 
<lb/>of water in weeks, the engine shakes her 
<lb/>so at sea that four pumps could not 
<lb/>keep her dry. Under sail in a rough 
<lb/>sea we scarcely make an inch of water 
<lb/>in 24 hours. <persName>Rae</persName> says that they <add place="above">engines</add> require 
<lb/>a complete overhauling. Before <persName>Hardisty</persName>
<lb/>left I told him quietly how I gradually 
<lb/>came to the conviction that he had been 
<lb/>culpably negligent &amp; especially by seeing 
<lb/>the state of the packing &amp; air pump. 
<lb/>He replied that <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Rae</persName> had put me up 
<lb/>to that &amp;c &amp;c. I did not take evidence 
<lb/>from the stokers as I felt it would be 
<lb/>acting too much like himself - always 
<lb/>on a level with them - but you will 
<lb/>see <persName>Rowe</persName> and may enquire if necessary 
<lb/>where the brasses were broken, and 
<lb/>what prevented <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName> mending 
<lb/>the wheel. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he idea that I prevented

<lb/>We left <placeName>Kongone</placeName> on the 6<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> and after 
<lb/>nine days find ourselves only in Lat 
<lb/>18° 16′ S. and Longitude 41° 10 East. 
<lb/>I question if the monsoons are to be 
<lb/>depended on here. We have had North 
<lb/>and North East winds &amp; calms - instead 
<lb/>of South East winds. Yesterday we 
<lb/>had our first fine south wind &amp; 
<lb/>ran before it 60 miles and at noon 
<lb/>found ourselves 12 miles South West 
<lb/>of where we started. We had a current 
<lb/>of at least 72 miles in 24 hours 
<lb/>the colour of the current water is deep 
<lb/>indigo. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he wind having died away 
<lb/>we got up steam and ran 8 <del type="strikethrough">miles</del> <add place="above">hours</add>
<lb/>to the East getting back into the common 
<lb/>blue of the ocean. The high lands of 
<lb/><placeName>Madagascar</placeName> must influence the winds, 
<lb/>and the current does not seem to be 
<lb/>very broad. It is probably between 39° 
<lb/>and 40° 40 ′ or 41° S. We had some 
<lb/>as we steamed out from the coast 
<lb/>then none in 37° &amp; 38° E. We met a 
<lb/>ship last year about 40° E. having 
<lb/>a current with her southwards of 40° 
<lb/>a day. I think some idea of the current 
<lb/>might be gained by its colour which 
<lb/>all remarked &amp; it was not influenced 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001815_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/>by the sky which has been cloudless. We 
<lb/>could not steam over to the East as we 
<lb/>can carry but little of our bulky fuel &amp; 
<lb/>must keep some as a standby<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>On 23<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> we reached <placeName>Mohilla</placeName> touching 
<lb/>there first in preference 
to <placeName>Johanna</placeName> as 
<lb/>fresh food is cheaper. Then came over to 
<lb/><placeName>Johanna</placeName> paid the Johanna men for 
<lb/>13 1/2 months. This required more than £100 
<lb/>the Admiral sent me. They <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> £1.8 
<lb/>per month and the headman £2 over the 
<lb/>regular pay for the whole time - the 
<lb/>expenses at <placeName>Mohilla</placeName> &amp; here I shall put 
<lb/>in next year<reg>'</reg>s account. </p>
<lb/><p>Tomorrow <del type="strikethrough">31 <hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> Augus</del> 1<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> September we 
<lb/>start for <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> intending to go up 
<lb/>in boats while the Pioneer lies and is 
<lb/>caulked all over in the Bay. I saw 
<lb/>that we should have some trouble in 
<lb/>towing Lady Nyassa in a low river - 
<lb/>we were bound in honour to take the 
<lb/>Johanna men back the Ariel being 
<lb/>bound to the <placeName>Cape</placeName> and if you have 
<lb/>looked at my accounts of the 
<lb/>doings of the Portuguese you will 
<lb/>understand my anxiety to be away 
<lb/>from them to an outlet of our 
<lb/>own. So we have concluded to 
<lb/>spend the months between this and 
<lb/>the December flood of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> in 
<lb/>boat exploration of <placeName>Rovuma</placeName></p>
