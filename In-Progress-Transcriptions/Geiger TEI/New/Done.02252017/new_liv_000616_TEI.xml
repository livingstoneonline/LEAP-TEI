<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My dear Father</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>Having been disappointed in the time the
<lb/>people should leave I have time to add a few remarks to
<lb/><bibl>my already lengthy epistles</bibl>. The most prominent topic on
<lb/>my mind is an attack of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName>. The poor fellow thinks
<lb/>that I have wickedly &amp; wantonly attacked him. He does not
<lb/>know that I would just as soon <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">have</add> tried to perform the
<lb/>trick of <persName><choice><abbr>St</abbr><expan>Saint</expan></choice> Dunstan</persName> as do any such thing. In <date when="1845-08">August of
<lb/>45</date>/ he told me when I requested my account from him 
<lb/>that he had sent <persName>Rogers</persName>' with it. But it never having come
<lb/>he said he thought it amounted to about <add place="above">£</add>30 exclusive of
<lb/>the food of some <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> (once a day a meal of <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term>)
<lb/>As he thought this might amount to about £5 I gave a 
<lb/>bill of £35 &amp; thought it was all over. A short time ago
<lb/>he sent an account made up to £45..15. As I had not
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the former I could not compare it But as there
<lb/>were - a bill of £2..5..6 of which I had his own <choice><sic>reciept</sic><corr>receipt</corr></choice>
<lb/>as having been paid to him once and two months boarding
<lb/>which for both himself &amp; me were charged to the <orgName>Society</orgName> I
<lb/>thought it right to ask some questions before giving
<lb/>away an additional £10. The two months boarding he
<lb/>stated positively to me he had charged to the <orgName>society</orgName> on two
<lb/>occasions I requested to know on what principle
<lb/>payment was demanded twice. He once pressed 20 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice>
<lb/>of very bad beads on my acceptance &amp; said O you will give
<lb/>me an equal number when our box comes. The box was
<lb/>weighed at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> &amp; a note taken of the weight on the spot
<lb/>200 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> &amp; upwards. The beads were divided &amp; a note of the division
<lb/>put with my half into the box - this note <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> 88 <choice><orig>¾</orig><reg>3/4</reg></choice> as
<lb/>my half of 200 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice>. I imagined the 11<choice><orig>¼</orig><reg>1/4</reg></choice><choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> of difference had
<lb/>been taken for the 20 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> of very inferior beads &amp; was satisfied
<lb/>But finding the 20 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> charged in this account as I had
<lb/>furnished the half of the money I requested a sight of the
<lb/>invoice. A tar bucket was presented to me by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName>
<lb/>the ear of it was patched so poorly by himself before
<lb/>our journey was over it broke off As it seemed an
<lb/>old one &amp; a new one I had formerly got from him
<lb/>was only charged 4/6 I demurred to paying 9/ as now <!-- Adrian, not sure if these fractions should be left as-is since written full-size, or coded differently HB 12-5-13 --> <!-- these are not fractions - "/" is a symbol meaning shillings in old UK money AM -->

<lb/>for what I <choice><sic>concieved</sic><corr>conceived</corr></choice> an old one. I did not know that
<lb/>teak never became old. As he was putting down his gifts
<lb/>as debts I thought I might as well remind him of 10 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> of tea
<lb/>which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> distinctly borrowed from me. A cap which
<lb/>cost me 9/ was put down at 7/6. An <term type="nationality">American</term>
<lb/>axe he borrowed &amp; never returned I put down cost price
<lb/>then requested the production of the bill mentioned
<lb/>in another sheet</p>
<lb/><p>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the enclosed meek communication
<lb/>lately &amp; returned the answer I likewise send for your
<lb/>perusal. I am quite positive as to the <orgName>Society</orgName> being
<lb/>charged for every iota of the expenses but as it <add place="above">statement</add> was
<lb/>made on his own authority on the same authority 
<lb/>I have to retract it &amp; beg his pardon the which
<lb/>I do very willingly as you will see. Look at the last
<lb/>page &amp; you will wonder still more at my folly
<lb/>in being <choice><sic>decieved</sic><corr>deceived</corr></choice> by such a character. <persName>Ross</persName>' conduct
<lb/>was so galling to me that I was glad to have any one
<lb/>to sympathize with me &amp; I allowed them to go on
<lb/>in their slanders continuously because of the conviction
<lb/>on my mind that in reference to speaking against
<lb/><persName>Ross</persName> I had been just as bad as themselves.</p>
<lb/><p>You will wonder that I grudge 6<hi rend="sup"><choice><abbr>d</abbr><expan>pence</expan></choice></hi> a day for my
<lb/>board 3<hi rend="sup"><choice><abbr>d</abbr><expan>pence</expan></choice></hi> would more than pay all I ate &amp; my bed
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="village">Mabotsa</settlement></placeName> was made just once in three weeks or
<lb/>once a month Did you ever hear me complain of
<lb/>being ill<supplied cert="high">-</supplied>nursed in my <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above"><term type="animal">lion</term></add> sickness? No <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>E</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> scarcely even
<lb/>looked near me after the first few days &amp; to get my
<lb/>arm dressed even when crawling with <term type="insect">maggots</term>
<lb/>I had to send for <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> - occasionally he came of his
<lb/>own accord but <del type="strikethrough">if I had not</del> even when almost
<lb/>dead I would infinitely have preferred <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> to
<lb/>dress it for me. It was evidently a grudge to him
<lb/>&amp; how could it be otherwise he &amp; she too were writing against
<lb/>me at the very time. Obligation on my part there is none
<lb/>unless in addition to neglect I ought to feel grateful
<lb/>for <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> and <term type="nationality">English</term> <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> boiled in <term type="foodstuff">milk</term>

<lb/>my <term type="bodypart">stomach</term> was well nigh ruined for ever. It is but
<lb/>very recently that I got over the bad effects of their eternal

<lb/>one likes I can never cease admiring the freedom
<lb/>I was far too polite in most things I would not do anything
<lb/>to give offence and as I tell them I believe my guilt in silent
<lb/>listening to their scandals is now justly punished in what
<lb/>they endeavour to fix on my character. If he troubles
<lb/>us more we shall send his epistles back unopened
<lb/>If he has never been slandered how very gratuitously wicked 
<lb/>his &amp; her slanders must have been-</p>
<lb/><p>We have put up the mill. It does well but it is rather inferior
<lb/>to <persName>Hume</persName>'s common mill. the latter grinds finer <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">&amp;</add> makes much less <term type="plant_foodstuff">bran</term>
<lb/>so we should be glad of the large one when you have an opportunity
<lb/>to send it. The trouble of sifting continually would be obviated
<lb/>if we had the large mill for <term type="plant_foodstuff">wheat</term> we should try &amp; make this
<lb/>the <term type="plant_foodstuff">maize</term> mill - if that can be done - some small bits of wood
<lb/>came out of it when we tried it first so I took <supplied cert="high">it</supplied> down
<lb/>to see from whence they proceeded. I was sorry afterwards
