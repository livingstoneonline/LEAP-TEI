<lb/>long ago to let you know that the hard

<lb/>by our contracting engineer has not

<lb/>which a decent engine would have done -
<lb/>and it was only a dogged determination

<lb/>to hold on so long. Leaving the labour
<lb/>of navigating the <placeName><settlement type="river">Zambesi</settlement></placeName> for a
<lb/>season <add place="below">^</add> we ascended a branch of it

<lb/><measure>hundred miles</measure>. This had never
<lb/>been examined by any <orgName>European</orgName>
<lb/>before. We then left the people
<lb/>there for awhile, and returning
<lb/>went <measure>about 20 days</measure> on foot
<lb/>beyond <measure>one hundred miles</measure>, and
<lb/>discovered a magnificent
<lb/>inland Lake called <placeName><geogName type="lake">Shirwa</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>(<placeName><geogName type="lake">Sheerwah</geogName></placeName>). This work was play

<lb/>to grind <term type="foodstuff">coffee</term> in a shop window, but

<lb/>men</term> so highly as I do now; but
<lb/>not to weary you with the story of
<lb/>our toils; I may state that I had the 
<lb/>great pleasure of introducing one 
<lb/>of my companions <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> to a 
<lb/>portion of the fine country which 
<lb/>when travelling acoss <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> I discovered
<lb/>one is so accustomed to think
<lb/>of this country and "Afric burning
<lb/>sands" as identical, that in describing
<lb/>the rich fertile valleys &amp; uplands
<lb/>with running streams, I often
<lb/>felt that it was hardly fair for
<lb/>me to expect persons entirely to
<lb/>believe me. When however we
<lb/>went on foot beyond the furthest
<lb/>point our vessel could go up the <placeName><geogName type="river">Shire</geogName></placeName>,
<lb/>we ascended in <measure>ten days</measure> <measure>\1500 feet</measure>

<lb/>and all green and covered with trees
<lb/>to the top. One, <placeName><geogName type="mountain">Zomba</geogName></placeName>, has a flat
<lb/>top and is inhabited - We could see
<lb/>the gardens from below - Its top is
<lb/>quite <measure>fifteen miles</measure> broad - and then
<lb/>all the country below is so fertile
<lb/>that one is quite buried in the tall
<lb/>grass <measure>7 or 8 feet high</measure> - Every few
<lb/>miles you cross a running stream
<lb/>or burn, and large fields of <term type="plant">cotton</term>,
<lb/><term type="plant_foodstuff">grain</term>, and <term type="plant_foodstuff">kassava</term> (from which
<lb/><term type="foodstuff">tapioca</term> is made) are met with. <term type="plant">Sugar
<lb/>cane</term> grows everywhere, and but
<lb/>little care is needed. This above
<lb/>all countries is calculated to yield
<lb/>the new materials of our commerce
<lb/>and if it should please Providence
<lb/>to permit us to introduce the
<lb/>trade in these we shall do something
<lb/>towards the extinction of <orgName>slavery</orgName>. We

<lb/>hope that I may see a beginning of a
<lb/>new state of things than a nightly <orgName>slave</orgName>

<lb/>the <term type="ailment">African fever</term> less formidable - and
<lb/>should the rich fertile country, most of

<lb/>the information that <persName>Miss Coutts</persName> had
