<lb/>curative I have delayed my departure
<lb/>till the present time. I have been
<lb/>most kindly and hospitably entertained
<lb/>by <persName>Major General Hay</persName> and as his
<lb/>house is situated about five miles
<lb/>from <placeName><settlement type="city">Port <choice><orig>Luis</orig><reg>Louis</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> and on an elevated <!-- Not sure Luis should be Louis? HB 6-19-13 -->

<lb/>the Author of all our mercies, not
<lb/>forgetting the good kindhearted

<lb/><p>I have had another object in

<lb/>him for his kindness. I wished

<lb/>as I intend to work still in that

<lb/>without the aid of our <orgName>Society</orgName>
<lb/>if I can only get back again
<lb/>I got a letter at <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Quilimane</orig><reg>Quelimane</reg></choice></settlement></placeName>. The only

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000918_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>informed that "the <orgName>Directors</orgName> are restricted
<lb/>in their power of aiding plans connected
<lb/>only remotely with the spread of the <bibl>gospel</bibl>"
<lb/>And also that even "though certain obstacles

<lb break="no"/>-mountable</w> the financial circumstances
<lb/>of the <orgName>Society</orgName> are not such as to warrant
<lb/>the hope that it would be in a position
<lb/>within any definite period to undertake
<lb/>untried remote and difficult fields of
<lb/>labour" As these statements are
<lb/>embalmed in some flattering sentences
<lb/>of approbation respecting my late
<lb/>efforts in opening up the continent
<lb/>to the sympathies of the <orgName>friends of
<lb/><term type="faith">christianity</term></orgName> I suppose that it is

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000918_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>As the proposition to leave the untried
<lb/>remote and difficult fields of labour
<lb/>as they have been ever since our
<lb/>saviour died for the poor sinners
<lb/>who inhabit them involves my
<lb/>certain severance from the <orgName><choice><abbr>L.M.S.</abbr><expan>London Missionary Society</expan></choice></orgName>
<lb/>and the attempt to support myself

<lb/>retain for the homeward voyage
<lb/>I go "overland" because I have a

<lb/>which does not seem to have been

<lb/>so am not exactly in the position

<lb/>but am poorer considerably

<lb/>some sixteen years ago. Yet I shall

<lb/><p>I am sorry <persName>Fleming</persName> was engaged
<lb/>so firmly as in the agreement - I
<lb/>cannot get rid of it. He was entered
<lb/>as <term type="occupation">Captain</term>'s <term type="occupation">servant</term> at <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Quilimane</orig><reg>Quelimane</reg></choice></settlement></placeName>
<lb/>and <choice><sic>recieves</sic><corr>receives</corr></choice> about 1/6 <add place="below">^</add> <note place="marginleft" rend="vertical">about £2 per month</note> a day for that <!-- Not sure if this coding for perpendicular text is correct, so included as ab at end of page transcription as well HB 6-19-13 --> <!-- I think according to the manual this should be done as a <note> so have removed the ab AM -->
<lb/>but says "that is nothing, he is 
<lb/>engaged at £10. per month till he
<lb/>gets to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>" and will insist on
<lb/>the fulfillment of the written agreement
<lb/>I wished to make an arrangement
<lb/>with a <term type="occupation">Captain</term> going to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName>
<lb/>whereby his services would be taken
<lb/>as part of his passage money but
<lb/>he objects to this because "they would
<lb/>make him do everything" i.e.
<lb/>in working the ship. I proposed
<lb/>to stipulate for personal service
<lb/>alone to the <term type="occupation">Captain</term> but he said
<lb/>to let the passage be paid and


	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000918_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/>no terms made respecting his service
<lb/>the agreement specifies services to 
<lb/><persName>Captain Peyton</persName> and that he is to be
<lb/>under my <choice><sic>controul</sic><corr>control</corr></choice> but he sticks
<lb/>to the £10 per month as the part most
<lb/><choice><sic>agreable</sic><corr>agreeable</corr></choice> to his ideas of the proper <w>ful -
<lb break="no"/>fillment</w> of his duties. I would
<lb/>have sent him off at once on
<lb/>our arrival here but the <term type="occupation"><w>com-
<lb break="no"/>modore</w></term> was expected daily and
<lb/><persName>Captain Peyton</persName> wished to take
<lb/>him to the <placeName><region>Cape</region></placeName> free of expense.
<lb/>It is unfortunate that <persName>Fleming</persName> was
<lb/>engaged at all as he is a most
<lb/>unlikely person to go anywhere in
<lb/>the face of danger but this you
<lb/>could not know, and I should
<lb/>probably <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">have</add> been as much <choice><sic>mislead</sic><corr>misled</corr></choice> in

<lb/>on whom he can lean - deprived of

<lb/>I am sorry too that my statements
