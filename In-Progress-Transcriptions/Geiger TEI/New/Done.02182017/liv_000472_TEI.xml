<lb/><p>My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>At length I am afloat and 
<lb/>our vessel is fast getting under weigh in order to 
<lb/>convey me away far from happy <placeName>England</placeName>. I have 
<lb/>no doubt but you now associate me in your thoughts 
<lb/>with the little place which I now occupy &amp; should like 
<lb/>to know how I like my new mode of life. I am 
<lb/>thankful to be able to say that the only report I can 
<lb/>as yet make is good, for though every thing on 
<lb/>board is in confusion &amp; must for some time 
<lb/>remain so, as all hands are employed in getting 
<lb/>the vessel in sailing order. Yet I am well pleased 
<lb/>with our accommodation &amp; passed as comfortable 
<lb/>a night in my little berth as ever I did any where else<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I don<reg>'</reg>t know much of our fellow passengers, as we 
<lb/>have only exchanged a few words, but all seem 
<lb/>willing to be pleased so I hope we shall go on together 
<lb/>comfortably - We have two ladies &amp; two gentlemen besides 
<lb/>ourselves. <choice><reg>O</reg><orig>o</orig></choice>ne of the latter is <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Grant</persName>, a newly fledged 
<lb/>assistant surgeon in the army, quite green &amp; but lately 
<lb/>extricated from the eggshell. I think the majority of 
<lb/>us are Scotch but we are none the better for that<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>We left <placeName>London</placeName> yesterday at 10 A.M. &amp; got on board 
<lb/>here about 4 P.M. &amp; now at 12 noon the seamen are 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000472_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>busy weighing anchor &amp; hoisting the sails - while I write 
<lb/>just now she has begun to move. I hope we shall have 
<lb/>no need again for the anchor <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> we reach <placeName>Simon's Bay</placeName>
<lb/>at the <placeName>Cape</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I don<reg>'</reg>t  <del type="strikethrough">place</del> attach much importance to the state 
<lb/>of my feelings, but cannot refrain from alluding to them 
<lb/>now in <add place="above">my present</add> circumstances as I know you will 
<lb/>feel with me. When I look back on all the way 
<lb/>by which the Lord has led me I see nothing but 
<lb/>manifestations of His Goodness &amp; Paternal care. Every 
<lb/>step of my way has been strewd with mercies &amp; now 
<lb/>greater than all he has counted me faithful, putting 
<lb/>me into the ministry &amp; sends me as a messenger of 
<lb/>mercy to the heathen. How much reason have S. &amp; I have 
<lb/>no doubt but you on reviewing your lives, feel constrained 
<lb/>to say Bless the Lord oh my soul &amp; all that is within me 
<lb/>be stored up to magnify &amp; bless the holy name. &amp; 
<w>Remem-<lb break="no"/>ber</w> me in your prayers that the loving kindness of the 
<lb/>Lord may <add place="above">have</add> the effect on my mind which he intended  &amp; that 
<lb/>I may live entirely consecrated to his glory - I do feel I 
<lb/>think grateful at present but I know the deceitful nature 
<lb/>of my heart &amp; am afraid <del type="strikethrough">that</del> lest I forget my obligations 
<lb/>to the grace of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<lb/><p>I could have written you this morning but there is a 
<lb/>probability that those which I did send may not be put 
<lb/>into the post office. The price of them being a temptation  
<lb/>to the cupidity of the watermen by whom we send them 
<lb/>I wrote <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Moore</persName> &amp; paid a man handsomely to take 
<lb/>it ashore - but as the same man would not take the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000472_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>captain<reg>'</reg>s wife ashore without being paid the exhorbitant sum 
<lb/>of 1/2 a guinea for about a mile &amp; a half, I suspect he would 
<lb/>destroy our letters - This I shall transmit by the Pilot, when 
<lb/>he leaves us in the Downs<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>All hands being employed about the vessel at present we 
<lb/>have not yet got to our luggage as it is stowed away<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I can<reg>'</reg>t yet from personal inspection acknowledge your 
<lb/>bounty contained in the box you sent last to the Mission 
<lb/>House. I beg leave again return you my warmest 
<lb/>thanks for all your kindness which I feel persuaded 
<lb/>has made an impression on my heart which shall 
<lb/>never be effaced - May the Lord Jesus himself reward 
<lb/>you with peace &amp; prosperity - &amp; shew mercy to every member 
<lb/>of your family<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Instead of sending your letters to <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phillip</persName>. Please address 
<lb/>to the care of <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> Adam Robson -</persName><placeName>Port Elizabeth, Algoa 
<lb/>Bay</placeName>- <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>ending them either to the Mission House or <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
<lb/>Sewell's</persName>- If you write a month after this I may 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> your letter when I arrive at <placeName>Algoa Bay</placeName>. As 
<lb/>we may be detained some time at the Cape - I need scarcely 
<lb/>say that when I write to you I shall speak with freedom 
<lb/>&amp; of course mention things which are not designed to be 
<lb/>seen by any but those whom I write<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I like <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Ross</persName> better now that I see more of her 
<lb/>we are in fact now so much in contact with each 
<lb/>other that if she were disagreable, I should not fail to 
<lb/>discover it -  seems willing to oblige &amp; be friendly. I hope we 
<lb/>shall have no reason to complain of each other<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Please present my esteem to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">iss</hi> Marshall</persName>, <persName>Miss Mary</persName>, 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">iss</hi> Mary Ruffle</persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">iss</hi> Stubbing</persName> &amp; the boys to whom I am known<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>May the Divine presence be with them all &amp; His grace touch 
<lb/>All their hearts &amp; <gap agent="damage"/></p>
