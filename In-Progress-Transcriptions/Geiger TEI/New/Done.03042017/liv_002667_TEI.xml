<lb/><p>When we could not discover a 
<lb/>path for camels thro' the mangrove 
<lb/>swamps of the mouths of the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>we proceeded about 25 miles to the N. 
<lb/>of that river, &amp; at the bottom of <placeName><unclear cert="low">Nikindany</unclear>, 
<lb/>Bay</placeName> entered a beautiful landlocked 
<lb/>harbour called <placeName>Kinday</placeName> or <placeName>Pemba</placeName>. The 
<lb/>entrance seems not more than 300 
<lb/>yards wide, &amp; of these about 150 are deep; 
<lb/>the reef on each side of the channel 
<lb/>shewing so plainly of a light colour that 
<lb/>no ship ought to touch. The harbour is 
<lb/>somewhat of the shape of the "spade" on 
<lb/>cards, the entrance being like the short 
<lb/>handle. There is a mile nearly of space 
<lb/>for anchorage, the Southern part being 
<lb/>from 10 to 14 fathoms, while the N.W. portion 
<lb/>is shallow and rocky. It is a first-rate 
<lb/>harbour for Arab Dhows, the land rising nearly 
<lb/>all round from 200 to 300 feet. The water is 
<lb/>so calm, they can draw their craft to the 
<lb/>shore to discharge &amp; take in cargo. They are also 
<lb/>completely screened by the masses of trees
<lb/>growing all round it from sea-ward 
<lb/>observation. </p>

<lb/><p>The population consists of coast 
<lb/>Arabs &amp; their slaves. The six villages 
<lb/>in wh<hi rend="sup">h</hi> they live are dotted round the 
<lb/>shore, &amp; may contain 300 souls in all. 
<lb/>They seemed to be suspicious &amp; but for our 
<lb/>having been accompanied by H.M.S. 
<lb/>"Penguin" would have given trouble. 
<lb/>The ordinary precaution of placing a 
<lb/>sentry over our exposed goods caused a 
<lb/>panic &amp; the sirkar or headman thought 
<lb/>that he gave a crushing reply to my 
<lb/>explanations, when he bluttered out "But 
<lb/>we have no thieves here!" </p>
<lb/><p>Our route hence was S.S.W. to the 
<lb/><placeName>Rovuma</placeName>, wh<hi rend="sup">h</hi> we struck at the spot 
<lb/>marked on the chart as that wh<hi rend="sup">h</hi> the 
<lb/>"Pioneer" turned in 1861. We travelled 
<lb/>over the same plateau that is seen to 
<lb/>flank both sides of the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> like 
<lb/>a chain of hills from 400 to 600 feet high. 
<lb/>Except where the natives, who are called 
<lb/>Makoude, have cleared spaces for 
<lb/>cultivation the whole country within the 
<lb/>influences of the moisture from the ocean 
<lb/>is covered with dense jungle. The trees 
<lb/>in general are not large, but planted so 
<lb/>closely together as generally to exclude the 
<lb/>sun. In many places they may be said

<lb/>to be woven together by tangled masses 
<lb/>of climbing plants, more resembling the 
<lb/>ropes and cables of a ship in inextricable 
<lb/>confusion than the graceful creepers 
<lb/>with wh<hi rend="sup">h</hi> we are familiar in northern 
<lb/>climates. They gave the impression of 
<lb/>being remnants of the carboniferous 
<lb/>period by geologists, and the huge 
<lb/>Pachydermata of that time were the 
<lb/>only beings that could wriggle thro' them. 
<lb/>Trade paths have already been made, 
<lb/>but we had both to heighten &amp; widen 
<lb/>them for camels &amp; buffaloes. The people at 
<lb/>the sea-coast had declared that no aid 
<lb/>could be got from the natives. When we 
<lb/>were seven miles off, we were agreeably 
<lb/>surprised to find that for reasonable 
<lb/>wages we could employ any number of 
<lb/>carriers &amp; wood-cutters we desired. As 
<lb/>they were accustomed to clearing away the 
<lb/>gigantic climbers for their garden ground, 
<lb/>they whittled away with their tomahawks 
<lb/>with remarkable speed &amp; skill. Two days' 
<lb/>continuous hard labour was as much as 
<lb/>they could stand. It is questionable whether

<lb/>continuous labour of a kind that
<lb/>brings so many muscles into violent 
<lb/>action as this work did. French navvies 
<lb/>could not compete with the English, 
<lb/>until they were fed exactly like the 
<lb/>latter. The Makoude have only fowls, a 
<lb/>few goats, &amp; the chance of an occasional 
<lb/>gorge of the wild hog of the country. </p>
<lb/><p>Little can be said about the 
<lb/>appearance of the country. By the 
<lb/>occasional glimpses we got it seemed 
<lb/>covered with great masses of dark 
<lb/>green foliage, except where the 
<lb/>bamboos gave a lighter tint, or a

<lb/><p>When about 90 miles from the mouth

<lb/>some bold granitic peaks the dim outline of

<lb/>is about 30 miles beyond our former

<lb/><p>I propose to make this my

<lb/>from one of my men. Our guide pursued 
<lb/>him at night - seized him in his own house 
<lb/>and the elders of his village made him pay 
<lb/>about 4 times the value of the article stolen. 
<lb/>No other case of theft occurred. No dues 
<lb/>were demanded, and only one fine - a very 
<lb/>just one - was levied. Attempts have been 
<lb/>made to make the Arabs pay, but they 
<lb/>have always been resisted. </p>
<lb/><p>So much has been said about Arab 
<lb/>prose by him, that it was with interest 
<lb/>inquiries were made about their success

<lb/>"It is as He wills it. " </p>
<lb/><p>The experiment with the buffaloes and 
<lb/>Tsetse has not been satisfactory; one buffalo 
<lb/>and two camels died. Had we not been in

<lb/>These broke out into large ulcers. The
