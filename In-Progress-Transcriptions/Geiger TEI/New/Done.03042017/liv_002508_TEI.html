<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">    </span><span class="del cancelled">My dear <span class="">Sir Bartle</span>,</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                </span><span class="del cancelled">By the first opportunity I have met with since 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>we left the coast I send a Despatch for <span class="">Lord Clarendon</span>, &amp; 
<br/>a request to <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Seward</span> to copy it for your private 
<br/>information. It does not coincide with the views of <span class="">Col: 
<br/>Pelly</span>, and I assure you it was not without long and 
<br/>anxious thought that I ventured to differ <span class="del cancelled">with him</span> <span class="add  above">from</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>him. I do not refer to him by name but feeling convinced 
<br/>that his reasoning as to the continuance of the <span class="">Zanzibar</span> 
<br/>Slave trade is untenable I beg that you will do me the 
<br/>favour to read a portion at least of what I have 
<br/>written. My sorrowful convictions have been deepened 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>by all I have seen of the working of the system, &amp; 
<br/>the dire ruin which for the sake of this paltry island 
<br/>annually overtakes much larger &amp; more beautiful 
<br/>portions of Country. I have been quite unable to copy 
<br/>it myself. </span>I had no prospect of sending coast wise, but 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>here I met a party of black Arab slave traders from 
<br/><span class="">Bagamois</span>, near <span class="">Zanzibar</span>, and while they agree to take a 
<br/>packet they will not wait more than half a day for me 
<br/>to write; they have come here for the first time - About 
<br/>10° 10′ south Lat. &amp; 31° 50′ East Long. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span><p class="p ">We have been a long time in making our way here, but 
<br/>some of the delay was pleasant for I had intercourse with 
<br/>people who had not engaged in the slave trade. We came 
	<br/><span class="fw catch right" title=""><span class="space">                        </span><span class="space">    </span>round</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span>
<br/>round the south end of the Lake. I was apprehensive if I took 
<br/>my Johanna men round the Northern Extremity they would 
<br/>bolt at the first sight of danger. They actually did run away 
<br/>on mere report of the doings of the terrible Mazitu or Zulus &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>I was left with a following of nine Africans, six of whom 
<br/>are Nassick boys. The Johanna men had proved themselves 
<br/>such thieves it was a relief to get rid of them. The most 
<br/>influential chief on the watershed between coast &amp; Lake, 
<br/>called <span class="">Mataka</span> wished very much that some of the boys 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>would remain with him &amp; shew the use that could be 
<br/>made of his cattle in Agriculture. <span class="">Abraham</span> met two 
<br/>uncles there, but no entreaty would induce him to 
<br/>remain though <span class="">Mataka</span> was extremely liberal &amp; seemed to 
<br/>please<span class="del cancelled">d</span> them all. "How can I stop where I have no mother &amp; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>"no sister?" was the invariable reply. I promised to try 
<br/>&amp; get some boys acquainted with Indian Agriculture 
<br/>from the same school; but the system for teaching for 
<br/><span class="">India</span> &amp; not for <span class="">Africa</span> had better be <span class="del cancelled">recalled</span> altered. 
<br/><span class="">Abraham</span> has done good service to me since so I have no 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>reason to be dissatisfied with him.//I was obliged to go very 
<br/><span class="del cancelled">carefully</span> cautiously, and seven or eight miles was all 
<br/>we could accomplish in a day. We went Westwards 
<br/>from the heel of the Lake - ascended <span class="">Kirk's</span> range which 
<br/>is only the edge of a plateau densely <span class="del cancelled">populated</span> peopled 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>with various tribes of Manganja who have not yet 
<br/>engaged in slaving. After going Westwards till we were 
<br/>past the Longitude of the Mazitu, we turned to the North, 
<br/>&amp; taking up the point we left off at in 1863 we continued 
<br/>our Northerly course, at times making a little westing. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>We crossed the wide valley in which the <span class="">Loangua</span> flows - 
<br/>the bed of an ancient Lake - <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: we">the</span> ascended the heights of 
<br/><span class="">Lobisa</span> in the Southern borders of Lat. 11° South. Here we came 
	<br/><span class="fw catch right" title=""><span class="space">                                        </span>to</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span>
<br/>to a depopulated country - an immense forest. The Babisa
<br/>were eager slavetraders &amp; the ruin that has followed that 
<br/>traffic is now apparent in only a few hamlets occurring 
<br/>at wide intervals - &amp; small patches of a species of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Millett at various parts in the jungle. The people had 
<br/>little or no grain to sell. They were living on Mushrooms 
<br/>chiefly, good only for producing dreams of roast 
<br/>beef of bygone days. While in the valley of the <span class="">Loangua</span>
<br/>we had plenty of game &amp; easily kept the pots boiling, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>but here not a beast was to be seen, &amp; daily trudging 
<br/>through dripping sloppy forests with the feet almost 
<br/>constantly wet, and gnawing hunger in the inner man 
<br/>took the flesh off our bones. We crossed the <span class="">Chambeze</span>, 
<br/>as <span class="">Zambeze</span> is here called, in Lat. 10° 34′ S. only 40 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>yards wide. but it had plenty of animals on its banks &amp; 
<br/>we soon got a supply of meat. This, the chief town of 
<br/>this side of <span class="">Bemba</span> has a treble stockade round it - the 
<br/>inner line having a deep ditch besides. If not mistaken 
<br/>we are on the water shed between <span class="">Chambeza</span> and <span class="">Luapula</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>which is said to flow into <span class="">Lake Tanganiyka</span>. It is said 
<br/>to be very large but I hope to let you know better from the 
<br/>Lake itself where I hope to find letters &amp; our second 
<br/>supply of goods. We are 4,500 feet above the sea, the 
<br/>temperature cool &amp; the rains more abundant than I ever 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>saw them in Africa - very few days pass without a 
<br/>shower. The Interior is chiefly forest &amp; excessively 
<br/>leafy - one can see but a little way of <span class="space">        </span> on an elevation. 
<br/>The Gum copal tree, another, a Cres <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: medium">Alpinca</span>, abound, 
<br/>with Rhododendrons &amp; various evergreen tress - the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>two first furnish the bark cloth with is the principal 
<br/>clothing of the people. We have had no difficulties with 
<br/>the natives. Hunger &amp; wet have been our greatest hindrances
<br/>We could not for some time find out where the Portuguese 
<br/><span class="fw catch right" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>route</span> 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span>
<br/>to <span class="">Cazemba</span>lay but it has been placed by the map makers 
<br/>too far East. Hence they had no mountain chains such 
<br/>as we have met with. The watershed between <span class="">Loangua</span>
<br/>&amp; <span class="">Chambeze</span> is 6,600 feet above the sea - They went in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>search of ivory and slaves. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">In case the sepoys destroyed my letter which I sent 
<br/>back with them I may say that their scheme was to 
<br/>force me to return as soon as they had killed all the 
<br/>beasts of burden. The Havildar actually payed in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>behalf of the rest eight Rupees to our Arab guide to 
<br/>feed &amp; lead them back to the coast. When found out 
<br/>there was a good deal of blubbering &amp; they eagerly 
<br/>accepted a sentence to carry light loads. They obeyed 
<br/>none of the Havildar's orders he evidently conniving 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>with them. They were an intolerable drag &amp; frustrated 
<br/>the best means I could devise for securing provisions 
<br/>namely by my going forward and sending in all 
<br/>directions for food. They would not march if I were 
<br/>not present &amp; even then when I was out of sight 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>they lay down &amp; slept. On finding that one <span class="unclear" title="word(s) unclear; certainty of transcription: low">Bunado</span>
<br/>threatened to shoot a Nassick boy when he got him out 
<br/>of English power I sent them back with ample cloth 
<br/>in the hands of a merchant to pay all expenses. The 
<br/>Havildar came on but could be made of no use in any 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>way - &amp; when we heard at the Lake that the seven 
<br/>Mahometans of the party had remained at Matakas 
<br/>where food was abundant in order probably to let 
<br/>their pay accumulate while they played the mendicant 
<br/>the Havildar became sulky and shammed unaccountable 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>pains in his feet &amp; returned to join the others. </p>
<br/><p class="p ">Mataka's town &amp; country are the most likely for a 
<br/>permanent settlement to be made. It is elevated &amp; 
<br/>cool. English peas were in full bearing &amp; bloom in 
<br/><span class="fw catch right" title=""><span class="space">                        </span>July</span>

<br/>July. the altitude is over 3000 feet &amp; his country is 
<br/>mountainous &amp; abounds in running streams the 
<br/>sources of the <span class="">Rovuma</span>. <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Norman Macleod</span> promised 
<br/>me to try &amp; get some German missionaries from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><span class="">Harmsburg</span> in <span class="">Hanover</span> &amp; salaries for them if I could 
<br/>indicate a locality. these same men go without salaries 
<br/>&amp; are artificers of different kinds but this is a mistake 
<br/>they ought to have a little for some of them have in sheer 
<br/>wont taken to selling brandy even - but at Makata's 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>they could easily raise wheat by sowing it at the 
<br/>proper time, &amp; native produce by planting when 
<br/>the rains come - but it would require a leader of 
<br/>some energy - &amp; not a fellow who would wring his 
<br/>hands if he had no sugar &amp; his tea. I have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>almost forgotten the taste of sugar, &amp; tea is made 
<br/>by roasting a little Joare &amp; calling the decoction 
<br/>either tea or coffee. I have written to the <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span></span> &amp; given 
<br/>some account of the difficulties to be overcome. 300 
<br/>miles is a long way to go but I feel more &amp; more 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>convinced that <span class="">Africa</span> must be christianized from 
<br/>within. </p>
