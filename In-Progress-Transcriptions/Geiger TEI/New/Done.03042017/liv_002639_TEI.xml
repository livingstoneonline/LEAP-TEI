<lb/><p>ARSENIC AS A REMEDY FOR THE TSETSE BITE.</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Letter from David Livingstone, LL.D.</hi></p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>, -- My time was so fully occupied,previous to my 
<w>de-<lb break="no"/>parture,</w> in preparation for this expedition, that I could not 
<lb/>find a moment's leisure to tell your correspondent Mr. James 
<lb/>Braid that the very same idea with respect to the employment 
<lb/>of arsenic in the disease which follows the bite of the <hi rend="italic">tsetse</hi>
<lb/>occurred to my own mind about the year 1847 or 1848. A 
<lb/>mare belonging to MR. Gordon Cumming was brought to 
<w>Kolo-<lb break="no"/>beng,</w> after prolonged exposure to the bite of the insect; and, 
<lb/>as it was unable to proceed on the journey southward, its 
<lb/>owner left it to die. I gave it two grains of arsenic in a little 
<lb/>barley daily for about a week, when an eruption resembling 
<lb/>small-pox appeared. This induced me to discontinue the 
<lb/>medicine; and, when the eruption disappeared, the animal's 
<lb/>coat became so smooth and glossy that I amagined I had 
<lb/>cured the complaint; for, after the bite is inflicted, the coat 
<lb/>stares as if the animal were cold.</p>
<lb/><p>The mare, though apparently cured, continued lean. This I 
<lb/>was rather glad of, as it is well known between the latitudes 
<lb/>20° and 27° S. that, when a horse becomes fat, he is almost sure 
<lb/>to be cut off by a species of pneumonia commonly called the 
<lb/>"horse-sickness". About two months after this apparent cure, 
<lb/>the coat began to stare again; but this time it had a remarkable 
<lb/>dryness and harshness. I tried the arsenic again; but the 
<lb/>mare became like a skeleton, and refused to touch the barley. 
<lb/>When I tried to coax her, she turned her mild eye so 
<w>im-<lb break="no"/>ploringly,</w> and so evidently meaning, "My dear fellow, I would 
<lb/>rather die of the disease than of the doctor," that I could not 
<lb/>force her. I got her lifted every morning to feed, and saw her 
<lb/>at last perish through sheer exhaustion; and this was nearly 
<lb/><hi rend="italic">six months</hi> after the bite was inflicted.</p>
<lb/><p>In my last trip from the Cape up to Linyanti, I was obliged 
<lb/>to make some exertion, with but one companion, to get through 
<lb/>a part of the country which was flooded by the river Chobe. 
<lb/>My men allowed the cattle to stray one night during my 
<w>ab-<lb break="no"/>sence,</w> and ten died in consequence. Two had been bitten so 
<lb/>slightly as not to die like the others. This was contrary to our 
<lb/>previous experience; but when I returned from Loanda, two 
<lb/>years afterwards, these two had remained like skeletons, 
<lb/>though feeding in rich pasturage.</p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002639_0002"/><!--pb/@n='361'-->
<lb/><p>While thanking Mr. Braid for his hints, I may state that, 
<lb/>though my hopes are not very sanguine, I still mean to try the 
<lb/>remedy, if opportunity offers. Our instructions require us to 
<lb/>examine the whole subject carefully. The result will be 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>municated</w> to the Royal Society.</p>
<lb/><p>Your notice of Dr. Flint's reports, in the Periscope of 
<w>Feb-<lb break="no"/>ruary</w> 13th, has suggested to my mind that I ought to draw the 
<lb/>attention of my medical brethren to the central parts of the 
<lb/>Cape Colony, and the interior generally as far as Kolobeng, as 
<lb/>presenting a most desirable climate for those threatened with 
<lb/>pulmonary complaints. On the coast, we do find consumption 
<lb/>among the Hottentots; but even there the climate is not 
<w>in-<lb break="no"/>ferior</w> to that of Madeira. Witness the medical reports of the 
<lb/>army. The troops, who are placed generally in the least 
<lb/>favourable localities, enjoy better health than at any other 
<lb/>station except Corfu. The central and western districts; the 
<lb/>mission stations Ebenezer, Scheit Fontein, <choice><sic>Kurnman</sic><corr>Kuruman</corr></choice>, 
<w>Kolo-<lb break="no"/>beng,</w> etc., which are quite removed from the moisture of the 
<lb/>ocean, present just the opposite characteristics of climate to 
<lb/>those which are believed to favour the development of 
<w>scrofu-<lb break="no"/>lous</w> or tuberculous matter; and consumption is quite 
<w>un-<lb break="no"/>known.</w> Then, as to exercise in the open air, in the way of 
<lb/>hunting, botanising, geologising, riding, walking, or even 
<w>sleep-<lb break="no"/>ing,</w> there is no country like it. I have always felt the 
<w>differ-<lb break="no"/>ence</w> sensibly as soon as I came near the sea. Nowhere else 
<lb/>will either man or horse go through so much work with so 
<lb/>little wear and tear of constitution. I have seen East Indian 
<lb/>gentlemen spending fourteen to sixteen hours in the saddle, 
<lb/>day after day, who could not have ridden half that time in 
<lb/>India without being knocked up; and the only refreshment 
<lb/>the horses got was a roll in the sand and the dry grass of the 
<lb/>country. All the Indian invalids who came inland were 
<w>bene-<lb break="no"/>fited,</w> and, more than that, became enamoured of the climate. 
<lb/>It is a mistake to detain patients in the vicinity of the sea who 
<lb/>are affected with phthisis. But the expense of going inland is 
<lb/>a serious consideration. This would not weigh with patients 
<lb/>in the better or higher ranks. A waggon complete, made in 
<lb/>the Roggefelt, which would stand the drought, would cost 
<lb/>£75; then £40 or £50 for oxen; a good tent, cooking utensils, 
<lb/>and a stock of provisions, would require at least £100 more. 
<lb/>But then you are independent. A good driver and leader 
<lb/>would cost not more than £5 or £6 a month; and, if you 
<lb/>follow the less frequented paths, you will find the Dutch 
<lb/>farmers all very hospitable and friendly, and, by arrangements 
<lb/>with them, you will be allowed to go where fancy may dictate. 
<lb/>If I had any relative affected with lung-disease, I would 
<w>unhe-<lb break="no"/>sitatingly</w> prescribe this course, as much more likely to arrest 
<lb/>the disease than Madeira; and I am certain that, even though 
<lb/>the result might be unfavourable, nowhere else would they 
<lb/>have enjoyed so much pleasure. They would be under 
<w>Eng-<lb break="no"/>lish</w> law, and get religious sympathy in death and burial.</p>
