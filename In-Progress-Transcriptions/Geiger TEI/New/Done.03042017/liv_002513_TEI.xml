<lb/><p>We have been a 
<lb/>long time in working 
<lb/>North to this which is 
<lb/>probably the watershed 
<lb/>the Geographers seek. 
<lb/>We are some 4,500 feet 
<lb/>above the sea and the 
<lb/>river <placeName>Luapula</placeName> lies 
<lb/>in front of us. This is 
<lb/>said to be very large &amp; 
<lb/>flows into <placeName>Lake Tanganyika</placeName>
<lb/>where we hope to be 
<lb/>by May next. I have 
<lb/>the anticipation of letters

<lb/>there and a fresh stock of 
<lb/>goods. The Arabs all fled 
<lb/>from me as if I had the 
<lb/>plague &amp; I could send nothing 
<lb/>to the coast. We had to go a 
<lb/>long way round about 
<lb/>besides partly to prevent 
<lb/>my <term type="tribe">Johanna</term> men running 
<lb/>away at sight of danger 
<lb/>and partly because the 
<lb/>Arabs were afraid that I 
<lb/>would burn their vessels 
<lb/>on <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> as <unclear cert="low">slavers</unclear>
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Johanna</term> men did at 
<lb/>last bolt at the mere 
<lb/>repeat of danger in front 
<lb/>and I went on &amp; faced it 
<lb/>with but nine Africans 
<lb/>six of whom are boys 
<lb/>from a school at 
<lb/><placeName>Bombay</placeName> for the recaptured

<lb/><!--hand01topright46-->the <term type="tribe">Johanna</term> men were such 
<lb/>a lot of <choice><sic>theives</sic><corr>thieves</corr></choice> that it was 
<lb/>a relief to get rid of them 
<lb/>We have since worked our 
<lb/>way North till we are 
<lb/>in a part blank on the 
<lb/>maps. We got enough 
<lb/>of meat in the lower 
<lb/>lands by the rifle. but 
<lb/>when we got up to the 
<lb/>highland of the <placeName>Babisa</placeName>
<lb/>not an animal could 
<lb/>be seen. the people all 
<lb/>scattered by their own 
<lb/>slaving could sell us 
<lb/>nothing. They lived 
<lb/>chiefly on Mushrooms 
<lb/>and by trudging through 
<lb/>dripping forests and 
<lb/>sloppy marshes. the

<lb/>and gnawing hunger 
<lb/>within most of the <placeName>Newstead</placeName>
<lb/>flesh came off my bones. 
<lb/>Here the people have something 
<lb/>to sell so we get on better 
<lb/>&amp; mean to rest a while &amp; 
<lb/>recruit. This village has 
<lb/>three stockades round it 
<lb/>the inner one being defended 
<lb/>too by a deep ditch &amp; 
<lb/>thorny hedge. When we 
<lb/>came I went to be publicly 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>recieved</corr></choice> by the <persName>chief- 
<lb/>Chitapangwa</persName> - no one 
<lb/>could go near him the 
<lb/>first time without a 
<lb/>present. He sat by a 
<lb/>huge hut and a dozen 
<lb/>men beat drums and 
<lb/>shook rattles so as to 
<lb/>make a terrific din 
<lb/>I would not sit on the 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_002513_0005"/><!--pb/@n='48v'-->
<lb/><!--hand03topleft5-->ground so he ordered 
<lb/>a big elephants tusk to 
<lb/>be placed <unclear cert="low">for</unclear> me. His 
<lb/>legs were like milestones 
<lb/>from the number of rings 
<lb/>and little bells on them 
<lb/>after talking a while he 
<lb/>came along with me to 
<lb/>a group of cows &amp; gave 
<lb/>me one sending the tusk 
<lb/>to me because I had sat 
<lb/>upon it, but I did not 
<lb/>accept of it </p>
<lb/><p>The country is covered 
<lb/>mostly with forest of 
<lb/>two kinds of trees mainly 
<lb/>and these yield to <unclear cert="low">bark</unclear>
<lb/>cloth with which nearly 
<lb/>all are clothed. The forests 
<lb/>are very leafy - burns 
<lb/>run in every direction 
<lb/>and all are now full

<lb/><!--hand01topright47--><!--hand03topleft-->I have no news since 
<lb/>we left the coast. I lost 
<lb/>all my medicines at one 
<lb/>blow. This is the sorest 
<lb/>loss of property that ever 
<lb/>befell me. I have had no 
<lb/>fever as yet but should 
<lb/>it come I must try native 
<lb/>remedies and trust in 
<lb/>that watchful care which 
<lb/>every moment guards 
<lb/>and keeps us with a 
<lb/>care more minute &amp; 
<lb/>constant than our self 
<lb/>love could attain. I

<lb/>to whom I ought. they 
<lb/>have just got their complement
