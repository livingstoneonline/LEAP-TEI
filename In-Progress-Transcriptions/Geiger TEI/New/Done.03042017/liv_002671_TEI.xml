<lb/>the geographical twaddle contained in the 
<lb/>paper referred to I have several things to plead, 
<lb/>such as, a dislike to being represented as 
<lb/>having discovered marvels I never saw 
<lb/>and being quoted as authority for things I 
<lb/>never said. My easychair friends are so 
<lb/>fond of garbling matters on the plea of "right 
<lb/>interpretation". (a favourite phrase with such) 
<lb/>that I fear I must soon make out a 
<lb/>list of things I did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> see. One of 
<lb/>them who is excessively fond of the 
<lb/>parenthesis, "unknown to themselves", actually 
<lb/>got up in a meeting of the Geographical 
<lb/>Society in which the discovery of <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Ngami</placeName> by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName> and myself in 1849 
<lb/>was communicated, and declared that 
<lb/>it had been discovered by <hi rend="underline">me alone</hi> many 
<lb/>years before. I was obliged to deny the 
<lb/>assertion. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen here comes another and 
<lb/>asserts that a large river discovered

<lb/>by the same parties in 1851 runs not on the 
<lb/>surface but underground. Now I cannot 
<lb/>afford to deal largely in travellers' wonders 
<lb/>I intend to return, and even supposing 
<lb/>there were no other considerations, it 
<lb/>would be rather inconvenient to be 
<lb/>asked by a companion who may 
<lb/>favour me with his company "Where 
<lb/>did you meet the men with tails? 
<lb/>Where was the Phoenix's nest? Where the 
<lb/>river running underground? Or where 
<lb/>did you drink the milk of she unicorns 
<lb/>in your coffee?" <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he return difficulties 
<lb/>are all avoided by those who neither go 
<lb/>nor come again.</p>
<lb/><p>In order however that your readers 
<lb/>may understand the assertions contained 
<lb/>in <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cooley's</persName> paper respecting the 
<lb/><placeName>Leeambye</placeName> or <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> I may explain 
<lb/>that there are two main chains in the great

<lb/>the <placeName>Congo</placeName> on the North and the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> on the 
<lb/>South. The rivers generally flow from the 
<lb/>sides of the country into the centre to form 
<lb/>the mains referred to, and these run the one

<lb/><p>When <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gordon Cumming</persName> was forming 
<lb/>his well known collection around and beyond 
<lb/>my house at <placeName>Kolobeng</placeName> I had somewhat to 
<lb/>do in the way of furnishing guides, and being 
<lb/>considered by them as a sort of father they 
<lb/>furnished me with a minute account 
<lb/>of the movements and adventures which 
<lb/>have since been published by the "Lionslayer" 
<lb/>himself. Sometimes the narrators were 
<lb/>sent forward with presents of game. At 
<lb/>other times they came for assistance to 
<lb/>extricate their master out of difficulties, 
<lb/>so it generally happened that I had to listen 
<lb/>to the stories from unsophisticated witnesses 
<lb/>a considerable time before we had the 
<lb/>pleasure of listening to the same from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Cumming's</persName> lips at our own fireside. 
<lb/>Now I have two reasons for referring 
<lb/>to this. One is I have frequently been 
<lb/>asked if <term type="reference">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cumming's book</term> were true

<lb/>reason may be seen in the following 
<lb/>supposing as I had it in my power 
<lb/>I had collected these hunting adventures 
<lb/>garbled and "rightly interpreted" and 
<lb/>published them in the manner of "Inner 
<lb/>Africa <hi rend="underline">laid open</hi>". Could I honestly have 
<lb/>called myself a "lion slayer"? My antecedents 
<lb/>would seem to say if I had made such 
<lb/>a mistake so far from pronouncing it 
<lb/>"very unsatisfactory" and trying to write 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cumming</persName> down before he could 
<lb/>publish a connected statement, I 
<lb/>would instantly have confessed my 
<lb/>mistake by transferring the profits
