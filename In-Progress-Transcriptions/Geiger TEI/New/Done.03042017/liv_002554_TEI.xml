<lb/>paper left so I take a leaf out of my cheque book to give 
<lb/>you the latest information and materials to correct some 
<lb/>points mentioned in the letter<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>West of the <placeName><choice><sic>Sualaba</sic><corr>Lualaba</corr></choice></placeName> the central line of drainage 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Great Nile Valley</placeName>. These are two large <space dim="horizontal" extent="1" unit="words"/> each 
<lb/>having the same native name <placeName><choice><sic>Sualaba</sic><corr>Lualaba</corr></choice></placeName> - These two unite 
<lb/>and form a large Lake which I am fain <placeName>to call Lake 
<lb/>Lincoln</placeName>. Looking back from this Lake to the <unclear cert="low">sewers</unclear>
<lb/>on the Watershed a remarkable mound gives out four 
<lb/>fountains not more than ten miles apart. Two of these on 
<lb/>the northern side form large rivers which again form <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Lincoln</placeName>, and then the united stream coming out thence 
<lb/>flows I suppose into the Western arm of the <placeName>Nile</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have presumed to give your name to one of the fountains 
<lb/>and a river by anticipation, for if I have any good 
<lb/>fortune at all I shall reach them ere this reaches you<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Of the two fountains on the south side of the Mound 
<lb/>one is so large a man cannot be seen on the other 
<lb/>side. I call it after good <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName>. It is

<lb/>remarkable spot, which if in <placeName>Armenia</placeName> would be the

<lb/>200 miles on the South West - again on the South East &amp; 
<lb/>East 150 miles off - then on the North East 180 miles 
<lb/>distant and here on the N.N.E. many intelligent 
<lb/>Arabs who have visited it, and had their wonder excited as 
<lb/>much as that of the natives give substantially the same 
<lb/>account. The Watershed from which the fountains of the 
<lb/><placeName>Nile</placeName> do unquestionably arise and on which stand <persName>Ptolemy</persName>
<lb/>Mountains of the Moon, is in length 700 &amp; 800 
<lb/>miles from West to East the Water collects into three

<lb/>The Western Line &amp; drainage is equally large. <persName>Ptolemy</persName>

<lb/>who had visited this very region and mistakes were

<lb/>was the pursuit of a foregone conclusion. When he discovered 
<lb/>the <placeName>Victoria Nyanza</placeName> he at once leaped to the conclusion 
<lb/>that therein lay the sources, but subsequently as soon 
<lb/>as he and <persName>Grant</persName> looked to the <placeName>Nyanza</placeName> they turned 
<lb/>their backs on the <placeName>Nile</placeName> fountains<reg>.</reg> Had they doubled the 
<lb/>correctness of their conclusion they would have come West 
<lb/>with the trough of the great Valley and found these mighty 
<lb/>Streams not 80 or 90 yards as their <placeName>White Nile</placeName> but from
