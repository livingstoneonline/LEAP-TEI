				<lb/><p rend="right"><space extent="2" unit="chars"/><placeName>Lopone</placeName> 25 Sept<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 1867</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My Dear Seward</p>
<lb/><p>I wrote you by a man called <persName>Magera 
<lb/>Mufupi</persName> from <placeName>Molemba</placeName> requesting a lot of goods 
<lb/>to be sent to <placeName>Ujiji</placeName> exactly the same as those 
<lb/>already sent by <persName>Koroje</persName> and which I hear have 
<lb/>safely reached their destination. Should that letter 
<lb/>have miscarried you will take this as supplying 
<lb/>its place and <persName>Koroje's</persName> books will guide you as 
<lb/>to the sort of goods needed. The medicines 
<lb/>were the most important want. A war detained me 
<lb/>3 1/2 months and during that time I was most kindly 
<lb/>treated by the heads of an Arab party namely 
<lb/><persName>Hamees Wadim Tagh</persName>, <persName>Syde bin Alli</persName> and 
<lb/><persName>Hamidi Mohamed</persName>. The chief <persName>Msama</persName> attacked 
<lb/><add place="above">them</add> as he has done native traders before, plundered 
<lb/>and killed some of their people, but got the 
<lb/>worst of it at last. I heard but one side 
<lb/>of the story, but several collateral circumstances 
<lb/>lead me to believe that <persName>Msama</persName> was to blame. 
<lb/><persName>Hamees</persName> lost a good deal of property there 
<lb/>and again at <placeName>Hara</placeName> by an accidental fire - 
<lb/><persName>Syde's</persName> property - beads, cloth &amp;c suffered severely 
<lb/>by <persName>Msama's</persName> treachery and <persName>Hamidi</persName> was also a 
<lb/>considerable sufferer. Yet they tried to make 
<lb/>peace, and the peace-making was a tedious process. 
<lb/>I ought to have said that the peace-making detained 
<lb/>me 3 1/2 months - drinking blood! don't shudder 
<lb/>my dear fellow it is in Homoeopathic doses only. 
<lb/>I should prefer it to another part of the negotiation, 
<lb/>marrying <persName>Msama's daughter</persName>, though she was 
<lb/>good looking enough. I came riding pick a back 
<lb/>on a man's shoulders; I then visited <persName>Msama</persName>

<lb/>His people were excessively suspicious, examining my 
<lb/>clothes to see if I had no guns concealed! 
<lb/>I had good reasons for not going round about 
<lb/>his country but cannot enter into them now. 
<lb/>I think that letters will reach you from <placeName>Ujiji</placeName>
<lb/>sooner than by this party, which is still going 
<lb/>West. I might have gone thither in a dhow 
<lb/>last week but have work here still.</p>
<lb/><p>One of the Nassick boys has left us and 
<lb/>will probably try to draw on your charity. His 
<lb/>complaint is dislike to work, he says that he 
<lb/>is a shoemaker &amp; has been a nuisance all along. 
<lb/><persName>Hamees</persName> says that he will take him to you. 
<lb/>I say let him go where he likes - he was 
<w>deter-<lb break="no"/>mined</w> not to work. He used to abuse me 
<lb/>in Hindustani to let the others know how bold 
<lb/>he was. I think he has a smack of idiocy but 
<lb/>it is often assumed. Don't trouble yourself 
<lb/>with him. When he left the coast he told me 
<lb/>to take my gun and shoot him if I insisted 
<lb/>on the very easy work of leading a mule and 
<lb/>did not allow him to load it with a big bag of 
<lb/>maize he had bought as private stores. I tried a 
<lb/>simple instrument in the shape of a stick to 
<lb/>his back. He did not venture to rebel again 
<lb/>but was a nuisance by remaining behind on 
<lb/>the march and at last gave his load to a 
<lb/>country lad and went off to collect mushrooms. 
<lb/><add place="inline">He</add>
<lb/>came up with his bonnet full of them but minus 
<lb/>his bundle which contained all our medicines<reg>,</reg> tools 
<lb/>and six large table cloths. This was in a part 
<lb/>so densely covered with forest no pursuit could be 
<lb/>made. Like many of low intellect he was 
<lb/>excessively greedy and careful of all he could 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002519_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'-->
<lb/>call his own; all he had collected at <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>
<lb/>and on the journey was carefully stowed away in 
<lb/>his bundle and he wore a rag only. He seemed 
<lb/>never to think that he had done wrong in losing 
<lb/>the goods. He next persuaded another man to 
<lb/>run away with him, this other put down a box 
<lb/>containing three chronometers in the jungle and 
<lb/>ran off. When sent for they had no complaint to 
<lb/>make. I offered to remedy anything wrong but 
<lb/>they had no fault to find with anything. Their 
<lb/>plan was to beg! I showed the folly of losing 
<lb/>his pay &amp;c &amp;c. This fellow called <persName>Baraka</persName> has 
<lb/>put his plan into operation again. He will be a 
<lb/>slave to the Arab slaves and get a share of 
<lb/>their food. I suspect that he was drunk 
<lb/>with <hi rend="underline">pombe</hi> and burned his thighs, by which 
<lb/>he was idle 3 1/2 months. He was well when we 
<lb/>started but had no load. He came 2 hours and 
<lb/>turned back. <persName>Hamees</persName> says that he will take him to 
<lb/>you but you will not incur any expense on my 
<lb/>account. I told <persName>Hamees</persName> to let him go where he 
<lb/>liked.</p>
<lb/><p>The buffaloes all died on the way to <placeName>Ujiji</placeName>
<lb/>and there I hear the dried flesh awaits my 
<lb/>arrival. I send a note to <persName>His Highness Said 
<lb/>Majid</persName> by this same opportunity acknowledging the 
<lb/>kindness of his people. I also give notes to the three 
<lb/>head Arabs as a sort of testimonials. They have 
<lb/>behaved like gentlemen all through.</p>
<lb/><p>I wish you to give <persName>Hamees</persName> a long single 
<lb/>barrelled rifle if it has come from <placeName>Bombay</placeName>; if 
<lb/>not then one of the new breech loaders I left 
<lb/>in a box soldered up in a tin at the Consulate. 
<lb/>Could you bestow one of your old rifles on 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002519_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'-->
<lb/><persName>Hamidi</persName>; a good one. I have not said anything 
<lb/>to him but to <persName>Hamees</persName> I have explained.</p>
