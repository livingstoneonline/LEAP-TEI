<lb/><p rend="no-indent">Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p><space dim="horizontal" extent="2" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>There is one measure connected with <term type="occupation">missionary</term> operations 
<lb/><choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> the employment of <orgName>native</orgName> agency in the work of evangelizing the 
<lb/><orgName>heathen</orgName>, to which although in <bibl>my last communication</bibl> I did not 
<lb/>very pointedly advert. I have been most anxious to call the 
<lb/>attention of the <orgName>Directors</orgName>.<space dim="horizontal" extent="7" unit="chars"/> Formerly when viewing the 
<lb/><orgName>Heathen</orgName> would at a distance the measure appeared one of 
<lb/>great importance and I resolved to give it earliest 
<lb/>attention. But now when I have come into close contact 
<lb/>with it, and beheld a little of that vast extent of surface 
<lb/>over which the population is scattered in the regions before me 
<lb/>I powerfully feel its special, nay, overwhelming importance. 
<lb/>Having lately in company with <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> R. Edwards</persName> of this mission 
<lb/>performed a journey (in going &amp; returning) of about 700 miles in 
<lb/>length, the tract of country we saw seemed to me of immense 
<lb/>extent, but when I look to the map it is a mere iota compared 
<lb/>to what is yet to be possessed by the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> of the cross. 
<lb/>But although the territory is larger than can be imagined by 
<lb/>any one who has not seen a little of it, and though the 
<lb/>tribes are situated at very formidable distances from each 
<lb/>other, I see no cause for discouragement. And if at any 
<lb/>time the prospects of success assume any other than a 
<lb/>bright and cheering aspect it is when I have out of 
<lb/>view the machinery of <orgName>native</orgName> agency put into vigorous 
<lb/>operation -- </p>
<lb/><p>In stating to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> my conviction that in this 
<lb/>country this means of evangelization is specially indicated 
<lb/>I need scarcely advert to the great efficiency of this class 
<lb/>of <term type="occupation">laborers</term>. Of their warm affectionate manner of dealing 
<lb/>with their fellow countrymen - Of their capability to bring 
<lb/>the truth itself before the mind entirely divested of that 
<lb/>peculiar strangeness which cleaves to foreigners - And of the 
<lb/>very eminent <add place="above">success</add> <add place="below">^</add> of those employed by the <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> of 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Griqua Town</settlement></placeName> I am persuaded they are already well 
<lb/>aware - Their success is most encouraging, and no less 
<lb/>so are the results which have followed the comparatively recent 
<lb/>employment of two by this mission. Indeed I have no 
<lb/>hesitation in affirming that during the short period <del type="cancelled">of</del>
<lb/>since they have been employed, these two have been as&gt;

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000500_0002"><!--pb/@n='2'--></pb>
<lb/>efficient in propagating both a knowledge &amp; love of <term type="faith">Christianity</term> as 
<lb/>could have been anticipated by even the warmest admirers 
<lb/>of <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">agents</term>.<space dim="horizontal" extent="5" unit="chars"/> In their hands the work still goes on 
<lb/>well, and every now &amp; then our hearts are cheered by goodly 
<lb/>accessions to the church of such as we hope that they are 
<lb/>the "saved in <persName>Christ Jesus</persName>"- And if the measure is allowed free 
<lb/>operation, if we are allowed by the <orgName>Directors</orgName> to employ a few 
<lb/>more who in the judgement of the <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> are fit for the work, 
<lb/>we may anticipate conversions by the Divine blessing to 
<lb/>increase in a compound ratio, &amp; regions not yet explored 
<lb/>by <orgName>Europeans</orgName> will soon be supplied with the <term type="foodstuff">bread</term> of life</p>
<lb/><p>I do most earnestly beg the sanctions of the <orgName>Direction</orgName> for 
<lb/>the employment of a few who are both able &amp; willing to devote 
<lb/>their attention to this work. And in this request I have 
<lb/>the full concurrence of these <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> on whose long 
<lb/>experience greater confidence can be placed. I may 
<lb/>also state <del type="cancelled">that</del> as a <choice><sic>garauntee</sic><corr>guarantee</corr></choice> for the purity of the 
<lb/>motives of those who are willing to devote themselves that Â£10
<lb/>is by no means sufficient to support a <orgName>native</orgName> of this country 
<lb/>It is consequently at a sacrifice they engage in <term type="occupation">the work of 
<lb/>the Lord</term> -- </p>
<lb/><p>With respect to the points at which operations could at 
<lb/>present be most advantageously put in operation both the 
<lb/><orgName>candidates</orgName> and <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> who know the country have 
<lb/>but one opinion, and that is, that the tribes 250 miles 
<lb/>northward <del type="strikethrough">than</del> are in a much more favourable state 
<lb/>for our object than those in the surrounding localities 
<lb/>The adjoining tribes amongst which no regular systematic 
<lb/>operations have been carried on, are decidedly hostile to the 
<lb/><bibl>gospel</bibl>. They treat <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> with respect, but at the 
<lb/>same time manifest very great opposition to the <bibl>doctrines</bibl> we 
<lb/>teach. And with scarcely one of them would a <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teacher</term> 
<lb/>be allowed to live - I state this with diffidence because 
<lb/>it is at direct variance with the opinions expressed in 
<lb/><bibl>my written instructions</bibl> yet at the same time I indulge the 
<lb/>hope that when I state that the very opposite of a great 
<lb/>desire for religious instruction prevails, my change of 
<lb/>sentiment will not be ascribed to insufficient <w>consider<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>-ation</w>, for conviction has been forced upon me by 
<lb/>proofs of which, had it been possible, both my prejudices

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000500_0003"><!--pb/@n='3'--></pb>
<lb/>and <del type="cancelled">inclination</del> expectations should have induced me gladly to have 
<lb/>revisited the pressure -- </p>
<lb/><p>The tribes within 100 miles North &amp; North East of this are all <w>parti- 
<lb break="no"/>-ally</w> acquainted with the requirements of the <bibl>gospel</bibl> but manifest 
<lb/>the greatest hatred to them, and this is just what our knowledge 
<lb/>of the human heart would lead us to expect. The same depravity 
<lb/>exists <choice><sic>every where</sic><corr>everyhere</corr></choice> and this although to <orgName>christians</orgName> it may seem 
<lb/>but the bare <unclear cert="medium">enuntiation</unclear> of a self evident truth, ought to stand 
<lb/>out prominently alongside the expectations of every young 
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionary</term>.<space dim="horizontal" extent="6" unit="chars"/> Those tribes however which be at a greater 
<lb/>distance say 250 &amp; 300 miles Northward are in quite a <w>diff-
<lb break="no"/>-erent</w> condition. They know nothing of the <bibl>gospel</bibl> &amp; consequently 
<lb/>form neither a good nor bad opinion of it. They know nothing 
<lb/>more of <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> than that they are a <orgName>friendly race of whites</orgName> 
<lb/>who love all men. And in many respects we occupy the same 
<lb/>position with respect to them as some of our <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> 
<lb/>have with the <orgName><placeName><region>South Sea</region></placeName> Islanders</orgName>.<space dim="horizontal" extent="4" unit="chars"/>There exists a strong 
<lb/>impression in favour of <orgName>Europeans</orgName>. Strongest among 
<lb/>those not previously visited by <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>, <term type="occupation">traders</term> &amp;c. but only 
<lb/>in a minor degree in the tribes nearer;<space dim="horizontal" extent="5" unit="chars"/> To account for 
<lb/>this phenomenon, it is only neccessary to remember the te<gap extent="4" unit="chars" agent="tear"/>
<lb/>scourging to which nearly all the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> tribes have been <gap extent="4" unit="chars" agent="tear"/>
<lb/>in recent years subjected. They have experienced the crueltie<gap extent="1" unit="chars" agent="tear"/><supplied cert="high">s</supplied>
<lb/>of the, to the <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term>, invincible marauders who <choice><sic>overan</sic><corr>overran</corr></choice>
<lb/>the whole country and they have all heard of their successive 
<lb/>repulses by mere handful of <orgName>whites</orgName>, and now the most 
<lb/>distant are most anxious to secure the friendship of <orgName>Europeans</orgName> 
<lb/>The last marauder the notorious <persName>Mosilekatse</persName> although obliged 
<lb/>by the <orgName><choice><orig>Boors</orig><reg>Boers</reg></choice></orgName> to retire to the <placeName><region>Eastern extremity</region></placeName> of a lake in the 
<lb/><placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> has recently recommenced plundering and the whole 
<lb/>country is in a state of alarm. Those who dread him 
<lb/>most have the greatest anxiety to obtain alliance with 
<lb/><orgName>Europeans</orgName> and this feeling will induce them to receive 
<lb/>either <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> or <term type="occupation">teachers</term> gladly; Now if we can 
<lb/>while this impression lasts confer on them a decided benefit 
<lb/>we may hope it will continue. But if we allow this 
<lb/>opportunity to pass unimproved it appears to me the time is 
<lb/>not far distant when the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> tribes will be in the same 
<lb/>state of indifference &amp; opposition to those nearer. Injurious 
<lb/>influences are now in operation to effect this. The <orgName><choice><orig>Boors</orig><reg>Boers</reg></choice></orgName>
<lb/>of <placeName><settlement type="town">Port Matal</settlement></placeName> have advanced right into the <placeName><region>centre of the continent</region></placeName> 
<lb/>&amp; seized most of the country &amp; the best of the fountains toward

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000500_0004"><!--pb/@n='4'--></pb>
<lb/>the <placeName><region>North East</region></placeName>. These on the one hand, and from this direction, <term type="occupation">traders</term> <orgName>Griqua</orgName>
<lb/><term type="occupation">hunters</term> &amp; individuals from the tribes which hate the <bibl>gospel</bibl> are every year passing 
<lb/>in with more freedom and in many instances they prove curses 
<lb/>instead of blessings (a <orgName>Griqua</orgName> has during this present year to my knowledge 
<lb/>communicated the <term type="ailment">venereal disease</term> to three tribes amongst whom it was 
<lb/>unknown before. One of these has been visited by <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> but the 
<lb/>other two have received one of the worst accompaniments of civilization 
<lb/>before the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> came to give any of its blessings. This <orgName>Griqua</orgName>
<lb/>does not belong to any mission station).</p>
<lb/><p>May I beg an early intimation empowering us to make an effort 
<lb/>immediately in behalf of the post ignorant <orgName>heathen</orgName> in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>

<lb/>if it is accordance with the intentions of the <orgName>Directors</orgName> to form a new 
<lb/>mission in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. I beg leave to call their attention to 
<lb/>a tribe called the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> the location of which is the best I 
<lb/>have seen in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. A large valley with a fountain about 
<lb/>equal to this at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> &amp; much more land which by reason of 
<lb/>the great <gap extent="2" unit="chars" agent="blotting"/>ight of the point from which the water comes out, could 
<lb/>be irrigated without any expense. Abundance of pasture for 
<lb/><term type="animal">cattle</term> with several other fountains at no great distance and a 
<lb/>manufacture of iron from ore found in abundance in the 
<lb/>adjoining mountains constitute the local attachments. Being a
