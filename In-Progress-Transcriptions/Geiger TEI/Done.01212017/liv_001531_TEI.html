<br/><p class="p noindent">My Dear <span class="">Captain Washington</span></p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">                        </span>I have resolved to allow <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>Rae</span> to go home. This vessel is done, and should 
<br/>another be on the way she will have her own 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>engineer. <span class="">Rae</span> will be able to do us more 
<br/>good by going home than by stopping, 
<br/>for if allowed to carry out my views 
<br/>of what ought to be done in this country 
<br/>a more trustworthy person could not 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>be found to give effect to our 
arrange-<br/>ments. He returns therefore on duty &amp; 
<br/>will come straight to you in London. 
<br/>A conversation with him will give you 
<br/>a clearer idea of our prospects than 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>any amount of letter writing. You 
<br/>spoke to him at Liverpool and he has 
<br/>regretted ever since that he did not know 
<br/>you or he would have let you know 
<br/>how shabbily we were being served. He 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>has collections of plants in charge for 
<br/>Kew and two live Lepidosirens for 
<br/><span class="">Professor Owen</span>.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">As I mentioned before a small 
<br/>vessel capable of being unscrewed at the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>bottom of the cataracts and carried to the 
<br/>smooth part above, seems necessary 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>to give us a proper footing in the slave 
<br/>market of <span class="">Nyassa</span>. Once there I have 
<br/>no doubt but we should soon eradicate 
<br/>the slave trade over a large district. <span class="">D<span class="sup underline ">r</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Kirk</span><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> C. Livingstone</span> &amp; <span class="">Rae</span> have but 
<br/>one opinion on this point. Personally, 
<br/>I am glad that the capabilities of the region 
<br/>we have opened do not rest on my 
<br/>testimony alone. And if I am rightly informed 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span><span class="">Burton</span> and <span class="">Speke</span> confirm my views
<br/>It is indispensible that we be entirely 
<br/>independent of the Portuguese. Their stations 
<br/>are not colonies but small penal settlements
<br/>No women are sent out, and the moral 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>atmosphere is awful. I question if there are 
<br/>five upright men in the country, and there 
<br/>is not a man woman nor child in it, 
<br/>without the venereal either hereditary or 
<br/>acquired. Hence the necessity of one 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>steamer capable of navigating the lower 
<br/><span class="">Zambesi</span> and the Cape while another remains 
<br/>on the lakes. <span class="">Bedingfeld</span> inflicted no end of 
<br/>harm on the Expedition  in rejecting the 
<br/>Bann, but what could a landsman like me 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>do but acquiesce. It would have suited us 
<br/>exactly but he certainly could not have 
<br/>navigated her out.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We think that the proposed vessel should 
<br/>be unscrewed into pieces of 500lbs each - that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>she should have an engine of at least 40 horse power 

	<span class="pb-title">0003</span> 
<br/>- draw not more than 30 inches yet 
<br/>come out herself. <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Rae</span> has <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: knowledge">knowlege</span>
<br/>of vessels which his employers sent out 
<br/>to Australia of that draught. He is highly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>esteemed by the Mess<span class="sup underline ">rs</span><span class="">Tod</span> &amp; <span class="">Macgregor</span>
<br/>of <span class="">Glasgow</span> and his status is much 
<br/>higher than what he occupies here. 
<br/>We ought to have a condensing engine 
<br/>with a screw, and a strong substantial 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>hull. Two scotch carts and a couple 
<br/>of mules from the Cape would 
<br/>enable us to place her on <span class="">Nyassa</span>
<br/>in three months from her arrival. If we 
<br/>could have half a dozen sappers and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>miners so much the better. I have 
<br/>submitted the proposition to <span class="">Lord John 
<br/>Russell</span>. If he declines it, then I shall 
<br/>get it from my own funds. My 
<br/>children are provided for, so far as 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>education is concerned, and I do not 
<br/>know a more noble object in 
<br/>which to employ some of the money 
<br/>got by the book than this. If 
Govern-<br/>ment saw the thing in the light I do 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>no difficulty would be made - but 
<br/>if not I think it clear that the plan 
<br/>ought to be proceeded with and <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Rae</span>
<br/>is instructed to that effect. I wish 

	<span class="pb-title">0004</span> 
<br/>you to examine him freely about everything
<br/>He is cautious in his statements and 
<br/>every word may be depended on. He will 
<br/>make a model of the kind of vessel we 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>need and submit it to you. His superintendence 
<br/>would ensure everything being done in a 
<br/>workmanlike manner, but you are 
<br/>not required to employ him unless 
<br/>that course should commend itself to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>your own judgement. If kept on I suppose 
<br/>his salary would require to be equal to P &amp; O Company's</p>
<br/><p class="p ">We lost a mail bag on the bar off 
<br/><span class="">Kongone</span> and are quite in the dark about 
<br/>what you are or have been doing - not 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>a word from you though I am sure you 
<br/>have written. The passage in has a 
<br/>bend in it. It lies to the left or West 
<br/>of the island in the mouth of the harbour 
<br/>and is quite safe for 2/3<span class="sup ">ds</span> of each month 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>at least. We got <span class="">Captain Berkeley</span> to put 
<br/>up another beacon and when the two are 
<br/>in line you have the passage or deep 
<br/>channel. Fortunately no lives were lost 
<br/>but if any one will go well to the West 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>of the island he cannot miss the channel 
<br/>and will lose nothing. The mail was lost 
<br/><span class="figure  ">{figure}</span> on shoal 1. <span class="">Bedingfeld</span>
<br/>nearly lost the launch 
<br/>on shoal 2. in the 
accom-<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>panying rude sketch - + is a 
<br/>canal which leads into the 
<br/><span class="">Luabo</span> near the sea. 

	<span class="pb-title">0005</span> 
<br/>It came to my knowledge in Nov<span class="sup underline ">r</span> last, that 
<br/><span class="">Captain Gordon</span> of H. M. S. Hermes had written 
<br/>a letter to <span class="">C<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Bedingfeld</span> impugning my 
<br/>veracity. I happened to be writing to <span class="">Captain 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>Gordon</span> at the time, and added the following 
<br/>postscript which I think you ought to see.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">P.S. 3 Nov. 1859. I was actually engaged in 
<br/>writing the foregoing sheet when a mail arrived 
<br/>containing your "copy of a letter to <span class="">C<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Bedingfeld"</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>My object in writing was chiefly to shew 
<br/>that I gratefully remembered your services 
<br/>while with us as after our separation; 
<br/>and as after conduct does not blot out 
<br/>the pleasant recollection of your really 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>hearty good will to the Expedition, I still 
<br/>venture to send it, and to say that nothing 
<br/>would delight me more than rendering 
<br/>some service to you or yours in return.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">A few points seemed to have escaped 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>your memory and as they might have 
<br/>modified your judgement in penning 
<br/>your letter they may without offence 
<br/>be recalled. "The practicable passage", 
<br/>for instance, was not "discovered by the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>Launch" but by <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Skead</span> in your own 
<br/>cutter. Having been absent with him 
<br/>on that service, our grounding <span class="del cancelled">with him</span>
<br/>during the night prevented my being on the 
<br/>spot when the Launch came round from 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>the <span class="">Luave</span> - but I was informed in the 
<br/>presence of a witness by one who ought 

	<span class="pb-title">0006</span> 
<br/>to have known, that the fault was his own 
<br/>in mistaking the proper passage across the 
<br/>bar, and sending <span class="">Bedingfeld</span> where in 
<br/>defiance of signals made by <span class="">Mr C. Livingstone</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>on the beach he went broadside on to the 
<br/>breakers. (this was <span class="">Captain Gordon</span> himself)</p>
<br/><p class="p ">You assert that <span class="">C<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Bedingfeld's</span><span class="underline ">proper 
<br/>place</span> was the steam Launch; you did not 
<br/>recollect that she was not a man of war 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>and possibly did not know that the pointed 
<br/>instructions of H. M. Government which 
<br/>I read to him in the presence of the whole 
<br/>Expedition; and also furnished him with 
<br/>a copy thereof under my own hand, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>assigned him the <span class="doubleunderline ">place</span> of sounding the 
<br/>bar in the whalers <span class="doubleunderline ">made</span> expressly for 
<br/>that service. Such instructions are paramount 
<br/>and as the same authority declared that 
<br/>no naval officer would be allowed to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>interfere with <span class="">Cap<span class="sup ">n</span> Duncan</span> in his 
manage-<br/>ment of the Pearl, your next allegation 
<br/>is equally injudicious</p>
<br/><p class="p ">You have omitted altogether the 
<br/>occasion of <span class="">Bedingfeld's</span> resignation, and 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>tacked it on to a matter which had no 
<br/>connection with it. <span class="underline ">You</span> may have been 
<br/>ignorant of the restrictions under which he was placed 
<br/>but <span class="underline ">he</span> was not. Had you been charged to 
<br/>protect <span class="">C.<span class="sup ">n</span> Duncan</span> as I was, I believe that 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>your ideas of obedience would have led you 
<br/>to perform your duty exactly as I did, 
<br/>though perhaps not so quietly. 

	<span class="pb-title">0007</span> 
<br/>(When the Pearl was aground <span class="">Gordon</span> watching 
<br/>the screw observed that the water retired some 
<br/>inches, before it was high water. He complained 
<br/>to me that <span class="">Duncan</span> had allowed the opportunity 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>of getting her off to pass. As I had been observing 
<br/>a steady rise at the waist I suggested that 
<br/>her stern might have lifted. He burst into a 
<br/>towering passion with <span class="">Duncan</span>, roared out 
<br/>that he would stake his reputation as an officer 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>of 30 years standing &amp;c. &amp;c. The water was 
<br/>found to be actually rising still, and she floated 
<br/>and got off an hour after the scene. <span class="">Gordon</span>
<br/>however handsomely apologized to <span class="">Duncan</span>
<br/>for his rudeness)</p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><p class="p ">"The frivolous and ridiculous events" 
<br/>(reasons?) to which you deign not to allude 
<br/>are so for the same reasons that Botany 
<br/>and geology are frivolous and ridiculous 
<br/>to the people among whom we travel. In the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>latter case the ignorance is excusable. Had 
<br/>I added a word or two more the case would 
<br/>have appeared clear, but this production 
<br/>of yours amply justifies the caution I 
<br/>exercised. (Note <span class="">Bedingfeld</span> was labouring 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>under irritable bladder, the most intractable 
<br/>of all the sequelae of syphilis. In England he 
<br/>was obliged to wear a gutta percha tube in 
<br/>order to relieve himself in the public streets 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: unperceived">unpercieved</span>. Here there was superadded 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>irritable bowels, and any one conversant 
<br/>with these complaints can understand 
<br/>whether it was "frivolous or ridiculous" to 
<br/>refer some of his folly to these causes. But I never 

	<span class="pb-title">0008</span> 
<br/>alluded to them except in an indirect manner 
<br/>and in a way that would not affect his character)</p>
<br/><p class="p ">You have constituted yourself the fourth 
<br/>witness to the fact of an altercation on board 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>the Pearl after my pointed injunction 
<br/>to the contrary. I made no charge without 
<br/>evidence from credible witnesses 
accompany-<br/>ing it - and am sorry to see that you 
<br/>imagine your mere dicta and "belief" on 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>hearsay could subvert point blank 
<br/>evidence. You cannot be a witness <span class="del cancelled">to</span>
<br/>respecting the putridity exposed to view 
<br/>after <span class="">Bedingfeld</span> was turned off, you 
<br/>being I believe at the time in <span class="">Simon's Bay</span>. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span><span class="underline ">You did not hear</span><span class="">Bedingfeld</span> "<span class="underline ">quietly</span>" 
<br/>"remonstrate" for by no rule of  
<br/>interpretation can the assertion that the 
<br/>"rivet heads are rusting off" "She will 
<br/>never reach <span class="">Tette</span> if you go down to the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>bar" &amp;c. be called quiet remonstrance. 
<br/>I had orders from H. M. Government 
<br/>to see the Pearl safely down to the Bar, 
<br/>and had promised to obey - but it is  
<br/>marvellous to you that I should wish 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>to get back my promise before consenting 
<br/>to go up river instead. You ought, 
<br/>my friend to have known all these 
<br/>points before committing yourself. A 
<br/>vessel painted inside and out with 
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>Peacock's patent on the voyage out, 

	<span class="pb-title">0009</span> 
<br/>with her rivet heads rusting off after 
<br/>only one month's service, was such 
<br/>a palpable stupid story, you could 
<br/>not have stomached it either. Again 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>you are altogether mistaken about 
<br/>the letter. It was written at once on 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: receiving">recieving</span> B's first resignation 
<br/>copied by <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> C. Livingstone</span> &amp; 
<br/>read by my second in command; 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>but I delayed delivery, believing 
<br/>that "I would not be doing as 
<br/>I would wish to be done by if I did 
<br/>not give B. time to reflect" this 
<br/>is what I told you, and you 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>kindly offered to "mediate". but I 
<br/>had never quarrelled. It was a 
<br/>question of delivery or non delivery 
<br/>entirely<span class="space">                </span>D. Livingstone</p>
<br/><p class="p "><span class="space">        </span>I have said nothing offensive 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>or intentionally so, but I consider 
<br/>it quite unjustifiable in you 
<br/>to accuse me of ingratitude to
<br/>the navy - some of your statements 
<br/>are insulting enough but you dont 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>thereby disparage the whole consular service</p>
<br/><p class="p right">A true copy D.L.</p>

	<span class="pb-title">0010</span>
<br/><p class="p ">(Note. I would not have troubled 
<br/>you on this subject again as I meant 
<br/>to have allowed it to drop, but 
<br/>we hear that <span class="">Bedingfeld</span> has been 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>going about London shewing 
<br/><span class="">Gordon's</span> letter. And he repeatedly 
<br/>declared that anything could 
<br/>be got out of the Admiralty by 
<br/><span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: boring">boreing</span> the "Old fools" I think 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it well for you to know that 
<br/><span class="">Gordon</span> allowed himself to be persuaded 
<br/>he knew matters of which he positively 
<br/>had no knowledge. He was tried 
<br/>by court martial after he left us, 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>and were he examined on the points he now 
<br/>has written upon, would appear to 
<br/>no greater advantage than he did 
<br/>there. I am satisfied that a 
<br/>great deal of the disfavour in 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>which the Admiralty stands 
<br/>is owing to the depreciation 
<br/>of their own officers - <span class="">Bedingfeld</span>
<br/>declared repeatedly on board the 
<br/>Pearl "that he got a steamer 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>because he never studied steam" 

	<span class="pb-title">0011</span> 
<br/>"that the Admiralty discouraged all 
<br/>scientific acquirements" and any 
<br/>thing could be got out of them by 
<br/>only plaguing them long enough. 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>It was impossible for <span class="">Duncan</span>
<br/>to respect a person talking in 
<br/>this way, and then followed 
<br/>the hatred in which when <span class="">Gordon</span>
<br/>joined my situation was 
un-<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>comfortable enough.</p>
<br/><p class="p ">On another disagreeable subject 
<br/>I neglected to call your attention 
<br/>to the difference of statement between 
<br/><span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> John Laird</span> and <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Macgregor 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>Laird</span>. <span class="">Macgregor</span> promised 
<br/>that she would carry Ten or 
<br/>Twelve Tons. <span class="">John</span> says she 
<br/>was to carry a very few 
<br/>persons. <span class="">Macgregor</span> promised 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>over rather than below Ten 
<br/>knots. <span class="">John</span> blames me for 
<br/>preventing her speed by loading 

	<span class="pb-title">0012</span> 
<br/>her up to 2 feet. Now without gear 
<br/>fuel, luggage, food or even water 
<br/>in the boiler, she draws 23 inches 
<br/>her paddle floats being 10 inches too 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>deep. The fact of the matter is that 
<br/><span class="">Macgregor's</span> mad idea of turning 
<br/>her up at each end upset all their 
<br/>calculations. The Niger canoes are 
<br/>made so to avoid the shock which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>they would otherwise give on coming 
<br/>to the banks. The bend allows them 
<br/>to slide up. With us the bend increases 
<br/>the draught and does not make her turn 
<br/>more quickly. He would not have 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>made this "mule" with his own money. 
<br/>By the engineer of H. M. S. Lynx I am 
<br/>conformed in the statement that it is 
<br/>a low pressure cylinder applied to a 
<br/>high pressure engine. One side <span class="add  above">of the boiler</span> remains 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>long cool after the other is hot: and 
<br/>it is not true that a pipe serves the 
<br/>purpose of a steam chest in marine 
<br/>engines. The authority for saying that 
<br/>the cylinder was the sweepings of the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>shop, was <span class="">M<span class="sup underline ">r</span> Laird's</span> own foreman, 
<br/>but we do not mention that publicly as 
<br/>it might hurt the man. From <span class="">M<span class="sup ">r</span>
<br/>Rae</span> you may learn further particulars</p>
<br/><p class="p right">I am &amp;c David Livingstone</p>
<br/>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span>He presumed largely on people's ignorance in saying that a pipe serves instead
<br/>It is probable that the boiler too was made for a land engine from being without a steam 
<br/>chest<br/>
