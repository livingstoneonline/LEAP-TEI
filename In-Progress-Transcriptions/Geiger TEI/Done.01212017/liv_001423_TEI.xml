<lb/><p rend="right">Senna 13<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> May 1859</p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Lord</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="1" unit="words"/>We have just returned from 
<lb/>the discovery of a magnificent 
<lb/>inland Lake, and as you took a 
<lb/>kind interest in our Expedition 
<lb/>I feel anxious to tell you about 
<lb/>our success so far. We ascended 
<lb/>a branch of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> called the 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName> about a hundred miles from 
<lb/>its confluence in January last. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he people were very much 
<lb/>alarmed never having been 
<lb/>visited by whites before for the 
<lb/>Portuguese have always been 
<lb/>afraid of them as a very warlike 
<lb/>race. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he steamer caused a panic 
<lb/>and we were constantly <choice><sic>gaurded</sic><corr>guarded</corr></choice>
<lb/>by large parties armed with bows 
<lb/>and poisoned arrows. Returning 
<lb/>lately we found the alarm 
<lb/>subsided and left the vessel with 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001423_0002"/><!--pb/@n='35v'--> 
<lb/>a chief named <persName>Chibisa</persName>. We then 
<lb/>proceeded Northwards on foot 
<lb/>and after 18 days march reached a 
<lb/>large Lake called <placeName>Shirwa</placeName>. It is from 
<lb/>twenty to thirty miles broad and 
<lb/>50 or sixty long -- We could not see 
<lb/>the end though we ascended a height 
<lb/>for the purpose but two mountain 
<lb/>tops rose in the blue distance like little 
<lb/>islands, and the waves dashed on the 
<lb/>rocks as if it were an arm of the 
<lb/>sea. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is no outlet known. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>water is slightly bitter and contains 
<lb/>plenty of fish alligators &amp; hippopotami<reg>.</reg>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he most interesting point about it 
<lb/>is the fact as asserted by the natives 
<lb/>that there is a partition of only five 
<lb/>or six miles between <placeName>Lake Shirwa</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Lake Nyinyesi</placeName> = "stars" - the 
<lb/>Nyanja, <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> &amp;c of the maps 
<lb/>which is very much larger - then 
<lb/>as we found out afterwards <placeName>Shirwa</placeName>
<lb/>a part of <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> is only about 30 
<lb/>miles from the navigable <placeName>Shire</placeName>. 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001423_0003"/><!--pb/@n='36r'--> 
<lb/><placeName>Shirwa</placeName> is surrounded by 
<w>moun-<lb break="no"/>tains</w> of great height. <choice><reg>M</reg><orig>m</orig></choice>any are 
<lb/>6000 feet high. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Lake is 2000 
<lb/>feet above the level of the sea - 
<lb/>the whole region is high and 
<lb/>well watered with flowing streams<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>A very great quantity of land 
<lb/>is under cultivation with cotton 
<lb/>and everyone spins and weaves it 
<lb/>even chiefs may be seen 
<lb/>with the spindle and a bag instead 
<lb/>of the distaff in hand. They treated 
<lb/>us well. Only one party seemed 
<lb/>inclined to treat us scurvily &amp; 
<lb/>they did so only <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> they 
<lb/>were told we were English - they 
<lb/>had taken us for Portuguese and 
<lb/>are in the habit of going down 
<lb/>to <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> with slaves for 
<lb/>sale. It is really no flattery 
<lb/>to say that to you we owe 
<lb/>the influence of the English name. 
<lb/>The French emigration slave trade

<lb/>
<lb/>goes on regularly now from <placeName>Quilimane</placeName>
<lb/>and the Portuguese say Ah we can 
<lb/>sell our slaves now the English 
<lb/>dare not interfere with French vessels<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is indisputable that the repression 
<lb/>of the slave trade was mainly owing 
<lb/>to the cruizers. The other part of the 
<lb/>plan - developing lawful commerce 
<lb/>will I fear be checked by this new 
<lb/>slave trade. A mercantile agency in 
<lb/>the <placeName>Shire</placeName> would soon collect large 
<lb/>quantities of cotton, but the Portuguese 
<lb/>jealously watch us lest we introduce 
<lb/>our own merchants. Were your 
<lb/>Lordship in power - (We have had no 
<lb/>news from England for fourteen months) 
<lb/>I would strongly urge free trade to be 
<lb/>secured on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. We slept 
<lb/>22 days on the ground in this high 
<lb/>region and got wet with the dew off 
<lb/>the grass which overhangs the paths &amp; 
<lb/>our heads every morning but returned 
<lb/>to the vessel in good health. We have 
<lb/>had cases of <term type="ailment">fever</term> among us but it is 
<lb/>easily cured, and I think that colonization 
<lb/>by our own countrymen would complete 
<lb/>what your Lordship began in suppressing 
<lb/>the slave trade<reg>.</reg> David Livingstone</p>
