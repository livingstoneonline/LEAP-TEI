<br/>
<br/><p class="p ">I have refrained from writing to thank you for your bountiful 
<br/>supply of Filters, because until now I had nothing of interest to 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>communicate. We are now returning from tracing this river up 
<br/>to its point of emergence from the hitherto undiscovered <span class="">Lake 
<br/>Nyassa or Nyinyesi</span>. We had a march of 250 miles on foot in the 
<br/>hottest period of the year - that called in <span class="">West Africa</span> the "smokes" 
<br/>when instead of scraping all together as you poor English farmers 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>do - tens of thousands of acres of tall grass are burned off and 
<br/>the atmosphere takes on somewhat the appearance of a <span class="">London</span> fog. 
<br/>But the discovery is worth all our toil and is of more importance. 
<br/>than at first sight appears, for we have opened

<br/>the crops, and instead of the unmerciful toil required in <span class="">America</span>
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>one sowing of foreign (probably American) seed, already introduced 
<br/>into many districts by the natives themselves, serves for three 
<br/>years crops even through the plants are burnt off. There may 
<br/>be evils to counterbalance these advantages but I am as yet 
<br/>ignorant of them. </p>
<br/><span class="linenumber">30</span><p class="p ">Well, the <span class="">Shire</span>, a branch of the <span class="">Zambesi</span> which I did not 
<br/>contemplate ascending is easily navigable for a steamer at least 
<br/>one hundred miles from its confluence. Then we have 33 miles 
<br/>of cataracts and above them the river is itself again right into 
<br/>the Lake in Lat. 14° 23′ South. Above the cataracts the land 
<br/><span class="linenumber">35</span>is arranged into three terraces of various heights from 1200 
<br/>feet to 3000 feet. On these we have changes of climate within 
<br/>a few miles of each other. On the last or 3000 terrace rises 
<br/><span class="">Mount Zomba</span> which we ascended and found to be between 7000 and 
<br/>8000 feet high. In the lower terrace, or <span class="">shire valley</span> which 
<br/><span class="linenumber">40</span>resembles exactly the valley of the <span class="">Nile</span> at <span class="">Cairo</span>, it was hot and 
<br/>stiffling (sic). One day took us up 3000 feet - pleasantly cool 
<br/>and great abundance of running rills of deliciously cool water. 
<br/>On <span class="">Zomba</span> it was cold, but even here there is cultivation. On the 
<br/>lower terraces cotton is cultivated very extensively but chiefly 
<br/><span class="linenumber">45</span>of the <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: indigenous">indiginous</span> variety which feels more like wool than cotton 
<br/>and requires to be sown annually. Well these climates would keep 
<br/>Europeans in health, and we flatter ourselves into the belief 

	<span class="pb-title">0002</span> 
<br/>that we can cure fever quickly even in the lowlands without in 
<br/>general loss of strength to the patient. I long greatly to see 
<br/>some of our own honest poor out here. They would do good to 
<br/>themselves, and help to free our country from the stain of 
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>dependence on slave labour. Beyond this part we have the land 
<br/>between the Lakes - <span class="">Shirwa</span> or <span class="">Tamandua</span> and <span class="">Nyassa</span> 
<br/>(2 half-lines missing from obverse of signature) <span class="space">      </span>a narrow isthmus
<br/><span class="space">                                                                                                        </span>trade from the 
<br/>central regions must cross the isthmus in order to get past the 
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>Lakes without embarking on <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: either">ether</span>. We met a large slaving party 
<br/>there - the most blackguard looking lot I ever saw - they had an 
<br/>immense number of slaves. On learning that we were English they 
<br/>slipped off by night, probably thinking the same of us as we 
<br/>did of them. The Lake at its southern end is 8 or 10 miles 
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>broad. It had a heavy swell on it though there was no wind and as 
<br/>it gives <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: off">of</span> a large river like the Shire, which never varies more 
<br/>than 2 or 3 feet from the dry to the wet season, it must be a large 
<br/>body itself. But we could not explore it, for we had left <span class="">Mr. 
<br/>Macgregor Laird's</span> sham vessel in a sinking state, and had to hasten 
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>back to it. Funnel, Furnace, Deck and bottom all became 
honey-<br/>combed after only 12 months wear - this is not the only hindrance 
<br/>and annoyance this gentleman has inflicted on us. </p>
<br/>
<br/><p class="p ">Many thanks for your kind present of Filters. I entrusted 
<br/><span class="linenumber">25</span>my naval officer with the duty of selection but fear that he took 
<br/>all <span class="del cancelled">that</span> he could get hold of. We have still abundant and they 
<br/>are very useful. </p>
