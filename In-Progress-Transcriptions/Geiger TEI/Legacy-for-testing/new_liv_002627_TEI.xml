<lb/>for two years it is a wonder that

<lb/>braving of death &amp; danger to serve me
<lb/>as a son might have done - thanks
<lb/>for the notices of your family - I can
<lb/>recollect them only as children &amp; would
<lb/>pass them on the street unwittingly - <persName>Ralph</persName>
<lb/>was a lithe blithe boy - <persName>Jessie</persName> had smiles

<lb/>them - <persName>Ralph</persName>'s ordination was well
<lb/>calculated to elicit all the pith &amp; unction
<lb/>in you, and you were very happy in your
<lb/>charge - your friends paid a graceful
<lb/>tribute to you in <unclear cert="low">franking</unclear> you home
<lb/>and back again, and conferred honour
<lb/>on themselves. May they long flourish
<lb/>in doing similar deeds. Glad to hear
<lb/>that the <orgName>Africanders</orgName> have got diamonds
<lb/>they first set the example of plundering
<lb/>me at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kolobeng</settlement></placeName> - if they heard of the
<lb/><orgName>Arab</orgName> &amp; <orgName>Banian</orgName> deeds in the same line 
<lb/>they would make amends by sending me
<lb/>lots of diamonds <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">in expiation</add> - half a mind will do
<lb/><add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">to <unclear cert="medium">ease</unclear> my ghost from haunting them</add> as I am not greedy. Remember me fondly
