<lb/>gives a good idea of the shape canoes

<lb/>then a tin box contains some bits

<lb/>then the house which an insect - a species

<lb/>its body is still soft. It is formed of 
<lb/>little sticks. then a number of shells 
<lb/>from <placeName>Lake Nyassa, </placeName> some are rare - 
<lb/>you may share them with your

<lb/>I don't expect you to eat it but

<lb/>Esq.</persName> Manchester - you remember

<lb/><p>I have not recieved <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> any letter from 
<lb/>you for a very long time. I expect

<lb/>with her for I should like to see 
<lb/>her - but I am afraid that she 
<lb/>could not live in the <term type="ailment">malaria</term>
<lb/>of the rivers here. We came through 
<lb/>the Elephant marsh today and 
<lb/>it smells so strongly of decayed 
<lb/>vegetable matter and has so 
<lb/>many mosquitoes it cannot 
<lb/>be healthy. If the land were 
<lb/>cultivated it would be more

<lb/>for all his creatures in our beautiful

<lb/>are crowded together in cities in 
<lb/>Europe and much misery is 
<lb/>endured in close ill ventilated 
<lb/>narrow lanes and dwellings &amp; 
<lb/>to those who dont know the
