<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My Dear Brother</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="4" unit="words"/>I send you the <bibl>enclosed letter</bibl> for the
<lb/><orgName><placeName><settlement type="city">Paris</settlement></placeName> Geographical Society</orgName> which I hope you will be kind
<lb/>enough to address and forward. I do not know the

<lb/>letter</bibl> about the Medal with which they have honoured
<lb/>me. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thompson</persName> informs me it is in his possession
<lb/>but says nothing of a <bibl>letter</bibl>. I write to thank you
<lb/>now because if one delays it may seem to them as
<lb/>if I undervalue their kindness, and whatever may
<lb/>be thought of the gift itself (by those who <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> get it) there
<lb/>can be no doubt about the kindness of the motives of
<lb/>those who resolved to bestow it I ought to thank you
<lb/>too for it for if you had not sent <bibl>my letter</bibl> I should
<lb/>never have been known to them. I shall move a vote
<lb/>of thanks to you when <persName>Mary</persName> comes. At present I have no
<lb/>one to second it and it would be a pity to let a good
<lb/>thing fall to the ground for want of a seconder. You
<lb/>do not give me a note though I have been so long
<lb/>without news. I have heard from <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> of the increase
<lb/>of your family and that all was right - except <orgName>Boers</orgName> likely
<lb/>to trouble you. I begin to wish you were North of
<lb/>me that the Newspapers might come to me first. I have
<lb/>not seen a single <bibl>Advertizer</bibl> since I left. All the Newspapers
<lb/>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> were a few <bibl><term type="nationality">Canadian</term> papers</bibl> &amp; two or three <bibl><orgName>Frontier
<lb/>times</orgName></bibl> &amp; two <bibl><orgName><term type="faith">Christian</term> times</orgName></bibl>, with about a dozen of that valuable

<lb/>as is contained in a little child's pictured pocket handkerchief</p>
<lb/><p>We had two <term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName> traders</term> here and a host of <term type="tribe">Mambari</term>, the
<lb/>former <term type="people">Portuguese</term>, and the latter connected with them in trade
<lb/>or as <orgName>slaves</orgName>. One had sixty <orgName>slaves</orgName> and will take away from
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Bashukulompa villages</region></placeName> which by an intrigue with an
<lb/><term type="occupation">underchief</term> who was put to death for it, 100 or 150 more
<lb/>The <term type="tribe">Mambari</term> found no market here and they fled as soon
<lb/>as they heard I had reached the <placeName><geogName type="river">Chobe</geogName></placeName>. One <term type="occupation">merchant</term> came
<lb/>carried in a hammock <del type="cancelled">carried on</del> <add place="above">slung to</add> a pole. He was probably
<lb/>disappointed in his market for he remained only 3 days and
<lb/>departed. The other whose name I may mention to you as
<lb/>this will not be published was <persName>Senor Antoneo-Francisco
<lb/>Da Silva Ferrevia Porto</persName>. <choice><sic>Its</sic><corr>It's</corr></choice> enough to take away one's breath
<lb/>Both come from the farthest inland trading station belonging
<lb/>to the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> in the <placeName><region>West opposite <placeName><region>Benguela</region></placeName></region></placeName>. It resembles
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> considered as a trading station. <persName>Porto</persName> seemed the
<lb/>richest. He had <term type="foodstuff">wine</term> at his table and sent me two <term type="foodstuff"><term type="nationality">Dutch</term> cheeses</term>
<lb/>and some <term type="foodstuff">preserved <term type="plant_foodstuff">pears</term></term>. He has erected a stockade and
<lb/>planted a flagstaff for the <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> banner. We suspect
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">underchief</term> who was executed for intriguing may have
<lb/>given him leave. At any rate it was by means of this
<lb/>person that he was allowed to cross the river and peel <!-- geog: Chobe -->
<lb/>the villages. He <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be allowed to come in again
<lb/>They would have expelled him but I interceded as the
<lb/>poor <orgName>slaves</orgName> would have suffered most. The plan was
<lb/>to hunger him out - and to a man with no <term type="occupation">attendants</term>
<lb/>it would have been effectual. I visited his stockade
<lb/>when he was absent. He wished us to travel in his
<lb/>company but I was so disgusted with the sight of
<lb/>poor gangs of wretches in chains I have resolved to go
<lb/>alone. The enclosed will give you an idea of what
<lb/>I have been doing. <placeName><settlement type="village">Katongo</settlement></placeName> adjacent to <placeName><settlement type="village">Nariele</settlement></placeName> is where
<lb/>the stockade has been put up. The <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> are dreadful

<lb/>savages. Killing is thought nothing of. Indeed it is an every day
<lb/>boast how many men a man has killed. Whatever dispute may
<lb/>arise it immediately degenerates into "how many men <w><supplied cert="high">h</supplied>ave</w> you killed
<lb/>You are a coward you never killed any one &amp;c &amp;c" No tribe needs
<lb/>the <bibl>Gospel</bibl> more than they - but the <term type="ailment">fever</term> is very bad, very fatal
<lb/>even to <orgName>Natives</orgName>. The devil has it all his own way here <w>a<supplied cert="medium">s</supplied></w> he has had
<lb/>for ages. 4 <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> have been executed in the most cool offhand
<lb/>manner since I came and when I remonstrated against shedding
<lb/>human blood they only replied that they "<unclear cert="medium">being</unclear> still <orgName>Boers</orgName> all are
<lb/>not yet taught". A short path in will be of benefit to
<lb/>the country. I go on horseback. It is reported that a waggon <!-- geog:  -->
<lb/>could not pass in consequence of numerous rivers &amp;
<lb/>Forests I have had <term type="ailment">fever</term> <unclear>9</unclear> times the last very severe
<lb/>Never had a touch of it till I came here though all the people had
<lb/>it on the way. It is not probable that I shall come out
<lb/>to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> again unless I have failed in finding
<lb/>another path. We met <orgName>Arabs</orgName> from <placeName><region>Zanguebar</region></placeName>
<lb/>subjects of the <term type="occupation"><choice><orig>Imaum</orig><reg>Imam</reg></choice> of <placeName><settlement type="town">Muscat</settlement></placeName></term>. One of them
<lb/>wrote readily in my <bibl>notebook</bibl> from right to left
<lb/><term type="people">Portuguese</term> <term type="tribe">Mambari</term> and <orgName>Arabs</orgName> were all intent on the

<lb/>why his name is not used. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know it. If any of the
<lb/>members are known to you they might give me a help
<lb/>by writing to the <term type="occupation"><term type="nationality">French</term> Consul</term> in the <placeName><region>West of <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName></region></placeName> -
<lb/>I think of <placeName><settlement type="town">Loanda</settlement></placeName> because there are <term type="people">English</term> &amp; <term type="people">French</term> living
