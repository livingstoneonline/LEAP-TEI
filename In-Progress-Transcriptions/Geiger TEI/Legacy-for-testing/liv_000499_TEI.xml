<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>I wrote you last Oct<hi rend="sup">r</hi> but having <add place="above">had</add> no opportunity of 
<lb/>transmitting it for a long time afterwards the letter became so old I was 
<lb/>ashamed to send it; I have now been longer in the country &amp; having 
<lb/>lately returned from a long journey in the Interior perhaps the 
<w>inform-<lb break="no"/>ation</w> I can now give will be more acceptable than that I should 
<lb/>have given by sending the other</p>
<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> you know are divided into a great many tribes 
<lb/>each of which is <choice><sic>independant</sic><corr>independent</corr></choice> of all others But they have all the 
<lb/>same language &amp; they dont differ much with respect to their 
<lb/>customs &amp; mode of life; they are all under the feudal system 
<lb/>of Government, the chieftainship is hereditary and although 
<lb/>the chief is usually the greatest ass, &amp; the most insignificant in 
<lb/>appearance in the tribe the people pay a deference to him which 
<lb/>is truly astonishing: I dont mean to say that they are all 
<lb/>downright fools. I saw one exception &amp; <del type="strikethrough">I hear</del> it is said there is 
<lb/>another sensible man about 300 miles from this. but with this 
<lb/>exception all I saw were certainly so. Indeed they were distinguished 
<lb/>by nothing but superior impudence in <unclear cert="medium">begging</unclear>. And these men 
<lb/>have the power of life &amp; death, administration of the laws! &amp;c. 
<lb/>Hereditary succession appears to be the same in its effects all over the 
<lb/>world - the only differences I could discover amongst 
<lb/>them <add place="above">were</add> a very slight change in the language as we went Northwards 
<lb/>and an evident increase of superstition. the language 
<lb/>towards the North seems more original, some letters are left out 
<lb/>altogether and there is an interchange of others but it is easier 
<lb/>for a native of this tribe to understand them than for a Cockney 
<lb/>to understand a Yorkshireman. But with respect to superstition 
<lb/>they differ much more. Far in the interior we scarcely saw one 
<lb/>grown up person without the instruments of divination or some 
<lb/>charms attached to the neck: they frequently divine, &amp; when they do, 
<lb/>they take off their sandals &amp; utter a sort of prayer to the deity. this 
<lb/>is quite different from what the missionaries found here. they 
<lb/>seemed to be quite ignorant of anything pertaining to the Deity &amp; only 
<lb/>recognised evil spirits - About 200 miles to the N. by East 
<lb/>we found a tribe busily engaged in the manufacture of iron &amp; 
<lb/>connected with it they have very many superstitions: the manner 
<lb/>of extracting the ore is kept as profound a secret as any of our 
<lb/>chemical works at home. the men who are employed at it 
<lb/>have to abstain from all connubial intercourse during a period 
<lb/>of five or six months &amp; never enter their own houses but 
<lb/>sleep in the kraal amongst the cattle during all that time &amp; 
<lb/>besides other observances they put medicine beside the furnace 
<lb/>&amp; into it all for the purpose of preventing disease in the iron - 
<lb/>the most fatal disease it is liable to is When they raise too 
<lb/>great a heat it is burned to a cinder. I tried to explain to</p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">the use of Limestone as a better sort of medicine than theirs But it would require 
<lb/>the experiment performed before their eyes before they will admit that 
<lb/>white men knew the business as they do. They admitted us because 
<lb/>we were foreigners &amp; had not been at home for some time, and certainly 
<lb/>it was worth seeing for they seemed to have the art in embryo, just in 
<lb/>that state Old <persName>Tubal Cain</persName> left it, two leathern bags with clay 
<lb/>tubes at one end as nozzles &amp; orifices <del type="strikethrough">opened</del><!--double strikethrough--> at the other opened &amp; shut by the

<lb/>A huge stone grasped in both hands, Another stone on the ground &amp; a 
<lb/><choice><sic>peice</sic><corr>piece</corr></choice> of the bark of a tree bent upon itself, constitute the hammer, anvil 
<lb/>&amp; tongs of these genuine Antedeluvians. But they make very good 
<lb/>axes spears picks &amp;c. Perhaps this is more owing to the excellent 
<lb/>quality of the iron than to the dexterity of the workman for they take a 
<lb/>very long time to finish anything - the ore they obtain in great 
<lb/>abundance in the neighbouring mountains - they also make 
<lb/>wooden bowls spoons &amp;c. And in the manufacture of these their 
<lb/>patience is wonderful. Some of the bowls are 3 feet in diameter 
<lb/>and almost all is done by means of a little knife, from the solid trunk 
<lb/>of a large tree. they do not cut them down but making a fire at 
<lb/>the roots bring them down by that means - Still farther toward 
<lb/>the North they have manufactures in Copper And with them as well 
<lb/>as with others who manufacture "white iron" superstition abounds 
<lb/>still more. What they call white iron I have not seen &amp; dont know 
<lb/>what it is but copper is used over the whole country as arm &amp; 
<lb/>leg rings - We went about 250 miles directly noth but the whole 
<lb/>distance we travelled was at least 700 miles. We went far to the 
<lb/>North East &amp; found the country improve in that direction. the trees 
<lb/>becoming larger, the wild olive covered with fruit, fig trees &amp;c 
<lb/>and more water but the Boers of <placeName>Port Natal</placeName> are advancing in 
<lb/>that direction. Towards the North by West the country is a 
<lb/>dreary desert with scarcely a drop of water to be found, But even 
<lb/>here there exists a tribe of <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>. they have no cattle cultivate 
<lb/>no ground &amp; have no fountains yet they love their liberty &amp; very 
<lb/>generally they fled from us lest we should seize them &amp; take 
<lb/>them away. Providence seems to supply their destitution of 
<lb/>water in a wonderful manner. Even in their most desert 
<lb/>places on the burning sand a species of bitter water melon 
<lb/>grows in great abundance. these they collect, making incisions 
<lb/>into them the juice flows out into their vessels &amp; with this 
<lb/>bitter stuff they quench their thirst, Probably like the Laplanders 
<lb/>with their sow thistle &amp; some folks with medicine. It now 
<lb/>tastes sweetly to them. the seeds of this plant roasted and 
<lb/>many other edible roots which they dig up serve as food 
<lb/>while a few skins of animals they happen to snare serve as 
<lb/>clothing to these hardy sons of the desert. they have a 
<lb/>great number of esculent roots &amp; some of them very good 
<lb/>One <add place="above">the manner of growth</add> of them struck my mind very forcibly. Above ground 
<lb/>you see nothing but a single tendril or two of a slender creeping 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">I</del> plant: dig down for perhaps two feet and you have still 
<lb/>a slender thing of a root but beyond that perhaps three feet 
<lb/>from the surface &amp; quite away from the immediate effect 
<lb/>of the burning Sun on the sand it suddenly swells out 
<lb/>in many instances thicker than ones thigh, and quite succulent 
<lb/>and perhaps a foot &amp; a half long</p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">Young ones about 2 inches in diameter &amp; 3 in length very much resemble 
<lb/>a young turnip but the old ones have an astringent taste. 
<lb/>I have got another root very much resembling them in size. It is saturated 
<lb/>with gallic acid &amp; something else, the natives tan thin skins with 
<lb/>it. It is powerfully astringent, &amp; when tasted immediately constringes the 
<lb/>mouth &amp; <del type="strikethrough"><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/></del> decomposes the mucous of the tongue, I have tried it in 
<lb/>some cases where an astringent seemed to be indicated with success. It 
<lb/>will prove I hope a means of saving my English medicines of that class 
<lb/>— As I am talking of plants I may mention a plant which grows 
<lb/>in abundance in this quarter &amp; when in flower scents the whole 
<lb/>atmosphere with its delightful odours. One of the French bretheren 
<lb/>being delighted with its fragrance thought it might be a good 
<w>subs-<lb break="no"/>titute</w> for tea, &amp; made an infusion of it. Of this both he and 
<lb/>another partook a little &amp; presently their whole nervous systems 
<lb/>were strangely affected. I cannot give you an accurate 
<lb/>account of the <del type="strikethrough"><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illegible"/></del> <add place="above">symptoms</add> for they are not able to give them in English 
<lb/>But the effect of the remedy was curious. A large dose of vinegar 
<lb/>seemed as soon as it entered the stomach to run along the 
<lb/>nerves to the extremeties of the limbs as if cold water had been 
<lb/>gradually poured over them beg<del type="strikethrough">g</del>inning at the centre &amp; pouring 
<lb/>gradually out to the tips of the fingers &amp; toes. After this they 
<lb/>very soon became well. I should not have mentioned 
<lb/>this but this is one of the plants the Bushmen make use of 
<lb/>in poisoning their arrows &amp; when I made a <choice><sic>decotion</sic><corr>decoction</corr></choice>
<lb/>&amp; tasted it, it caused a burning sensation on the tongue &amp; roof of 
<lb/>the mouth with a sense of stoppage in the nostrils. When 
<lb/>however I added a little acetic acid to the <choice><sic>decotion</sic><corr>decoction</corr></choice> it made <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/>
<lb/>quite bland. Would I be justified in trying this bland <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/>
<lb/>in a case of <term type="ailment">Rheumatism</term>? I cant get dogs on which to 
<lb/>try its physiological effects. I have thought, the <del type="strikethrough">salt</del> <add place="above">compound</add> which 
<lb/>seems to be formed by the acetic acid might be useful in the 
<lb/>same manner. some of the preparations of other virulent 
<lb/>poisons are, but I am scrupulous about trying. I have 
<lb/>felt no effects from it myself even when taken in drachm 
<lb/>doses - I shall feel obliged by your spending an hour on me at your 
<lb/>leisure. I feel the benefit often of your instructions &amp; of those I got 
<lb/>through your kindness And here I have an immense practice 
<lb/>I have patients now under treatment who have walked on 
<lb/>foot 130 miles for for my advice: And when these go home others 
<lb/>will come for the same purpose. this is the country for a medical 
<lb/>man if he wants a large practice but he must leave fees out 
<lb/>of the question. <term type="tribe">the Bechuanas</term> have a great deal more 
<lb/>disease than I expected to find amongst a savage nation. but 
<lb/>little else can be expected for they are nearly naked &amp; endure 
<lb/>the scorching heat of the day &amp; the chills of the night in that state 
<lb/>Add to this they are absolutely omniverous, <term type="ailment">Indigestion</term>
<lb/><term type="ailment">Rheumatism</term> &amp; <term type="ailment">Ophthalmia</term> are the prevailing diseases, the latter 
<lb/>is caused by the hot winds which coming over the extensive 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">sanding</unclear> plains to the north west load themselves with myriads 
<lb/>of fine particles and produce a disease which for its virulence 
<lb/>deserves to be called the <term type="ailment">Bechuana purulent ophthalmia</term>. When 
<lb/>in the interior many very bad cases were brought to me

<lb/>at every village &amp; sometimes my waggon was quite beseiged by these 
<lb/>blind &amp; <unclear cert="low">halt</unclear> &amp; lame What a mighty effect would be produced if one 
<lb/>of the seventy disciples were amongst them to heal them all by a word. 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> resort to the <term type="tribe">Bushmen</term> &amp; these poor people that live in the 
<lb/>desert for Doctors. the fact of my dealing in that line a little is so strange 
<lb/>&amp; new my fame has spread far &amp; wide But if one of Christs 
<lb/>Apsotles were here I should think he would very soon be known 
<lb/>all over to <placeName>Abyssinia</placeName>. The great deal of work I have had to 
<lb/>do in attending to the sick has proved beneficial to me, for they 
<lb/>make me speak the language perpetually &amp; If I were inclined to be 
<lb/>lazy in learning it they would prevent me indulging this 
<lb/>propensity. And they are excellent patients too besides, there 
<lb/>is no <unclear cert="medium">wincing</unclear>. Every thing prescribed is done instanter, their 
<lb/>only failing is they become tired of a long course. But in any 
<lb/>operation even the women sit unmoved. I have been quite 
<lb/><anchor xml:id="envelopePosition" type="positionMarker"/> astonished again &amp; again at their calmness. In cutting out a 
<lb/>tumour an inch in diameter they sit &amp; talk as if they felt 
<lb/>nothing. "A man like me never cries" they say "they are 
<lb/>children who cry" it is a fact the men never cry But 
<lb/>when the spirit of God works on their minds they cry most 
<lb/>pitiously. Sometimes in Church they endeavour to hide themselves 
<lb/>from the eye of the preacher by creeping under the forms or hiding 
<lb/>their heads with their Karosses as a remedy against their 
<lb/>convictions And when they find that wont do they rush out 
<lb/>of the church &amp; run with all their might crying as if the hand of 
<lb/>death were behind them. One would think when they had 
<lb/>got away there they would remain but no then they are 
<lb/>in their places at the very next meeting</p>
