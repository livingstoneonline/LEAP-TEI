<lb/><p rend="right">1860 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I take the liberty of enclosing a 
<lb/>list of articles said by <persName>Baines</persName> to have 
<lb/>been furnished by <persName>Windsor</persName> &amp; <persName>Newton</persName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He had stowed away a very large quantity 
<lb/>of artists' materials in his private boxes 
<lb/>and on <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> asking where he got 
<lb/>them, replied, that <persName>Windsor</persName> &amp; <persName>Newton</persName>
<lb/>had made him a present of them. 
<lb/>Then, that he got them out of the 
<lb/>Australian expedition. It might easily 
<lb/>be ascertained whether <persName>Windsor</persName> &amp; <persName>Newton</persName>
<lb/>(Spring gardens) really made him a 
<lb/>present of those materials - paints of 
<lb/>all kinds - canvas &amp;c. I suspect 
<lb/>the Australian Expedition was a 
<lb/>droll one and the Colonial office 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001541_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>unwittingly gave him a good character<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He has a large parcel of brass rings 
<lb/>in his boxes at <placeName>Tette</placeName> stolen from 
<lb/>my private property. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>Thornton</persName> seemed to turn over a new 
<lb/>leaf when cut off from us. We could 
<lb/>not previously get a bit of work 
<lb/>out of him. He tried to get <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>to invalid him in vain. He went up 
<lb/>to <placeName>Zumbo</placeName> with a half cast trader 
<lb/>but has only confounded my published 
<lb/>opinion of the extension of the 
<lb/>coal field thither. I offered him a 
<lb/>passage home but the Portuguese 
<lb/>have induced him to examine the 
<lb/>upper part of <placeName>Kebrabasa</placeName> for a 
<lb/>silver mine said to have been once 
<lb/>worked by the Jesuits. He says he 
<lb/>has no animus against me. "It was 
<lb/>a lethargy he could not shake off.", and 
<lb/>he is now fat &amp; well. He wished 
<lb/>me to sell him our theodolite and 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001541_0003"/><!--pb/@n='3'--> 
<lb/>a sextant but I could not see Gov<hi rend="sup underline">t</hi>
<lb/>property. He has the use of all the 
<lb/>instruments he brought out<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>By the way our craft has nearly 
<lb/>ruined most of the magnetic 
<lb/>instruments besides provisions &amp; 
<lb/>private property. We can take only 
<lb/>what barely serves for a trip 
<lb/>she is so leaky and wet. Could 
<lb/>you send us some magnetic 
<lb/>instruments that may have been 
<lb/>returned from other Expeditions 
<lb/>i.e. if we get a new ship 
<lb/>like the Bann. With incredible 
<lb/>labour and repeated dryings 
<lb/>my worthy associate <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Kirk</persName> 
<lb/>has at least got his collection 
<lb/>down so far to the sea. I feel 
<lb/>sure that <persName>Sir William Hooker</persName>
<lb/>will be pleased and I am 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001541_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>his choice does him great credit 
<lb/>there are many new plants and 
<lb/>I hope you will make the valuable 
<lb/>woods &amp; cottons known. We have 
<lb/>sent seeds of Buaze to <placeName>Natal</placeName>, the 
<lb/><placeName>Cape</placeName> and <placeName>India</placeName>. </p>
<lb/><p>I hope you will lend your 
<lb/>aid in getting freedom of navigation 
<lb/>on the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. While the Portuguese 
<lb/>have the exclusive use of it no 
<lb/>good can be done. They are few 
<lb/>in number and of the convict class 
<lb/>chiefly. The immorality is frightful 
<lb/>and any one who does <choice><sic>no</sic><corr>not</corr></choice> do as 
<lb/>they do is hated - they hate us 
<lb/>bitterly, but we have had no quarrel. 
<lb/>We keep aloof and seem to be 
<lb/>regarded as standing protests 
<lb/>against their ways. According to 
<lb/>them the fine young men of 
<lb/><persName>Commodore Owen's</persName> party

<lb/>were killed by indulgences with 
<lb/><persName>Donna Pascoa</persName> &amp; other women 
<lb/>at this place. <persName>Bedingfeld</persName>
<lb/>had been exhibiting his bougies 
<lb/>here and I was taken aback 
<lb/>by the superintendant of the 
<lb/>estate once asking me something 
<lb/>about him and <del type="strikethrough">asking</del> specifying 
<lb/>him as "the officer with 
<lb/>thirty Bougies." I am not so 
<lb/>much discouraged by the defections 
<lb/>that have taken place as you 
<lb/>may be for I have seen a 
<lb/>good many occur even among 
<lb/>missionaries. It is only by 
<lb/>patient perseverance that 
<lb/>success is ultimately obtained 
<lb/>and should I get the vessels 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_001541_0006"/><!--pb/@n='6'--> 
<lb/>I have applied for I feel confident 
<lb/>that with the Divine blessing 
<lb/>a large amount of good will 
<lb/>result. We have overcome the 
<lb/>fever, and know that any 
<lb/>European living morally need 
<lb/>not fear it more than a 
<lb/>common cold. A curious 
<lb/>point has of late shewed itself 
<lb/>a very greatly decreased dose 
<lb/>of the remedy serves better 
<lb/>than a large one did at first 
<lb/>1/2 a grain of the pill produces 
<lb/>as much effect as 10 or 12 
<lb/>did formerly. Good living 
<lb/>is essential i.e. if compelled 
<lb/>to live on salt meat or maize meal 
<lb/>we are more liable to fever. We 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001541_0007"/><!--pb/@n='7'--> 
<lb/>must have flour and fresh meat 
<lb/>and I think that after any specially 
<lb/>hard work ale would be beneficial 
<lb/>for when we returned from 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName> after forty days tramp 
<lb/>we all took a sore longing for 
<lb/>a glass of beer though on ordinary 
<lb/>occasions and at home we 
<lb/>don<reg>'</reg>t care for it. </p>
<lb/><p>I have been obliged to buy 
<lb/>calico to pay current expenses 
<lb/>this is very much dearer than 
<lb/>what I got from <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Turner</persName> 
<lb/>of <placeName>Manchester</placeName>. Our Makololo 
<lb/>crew of 12 did well for six 
<lb/>months but got so tired by 
<lb/>perpetual wood cutting in 

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_001541_0008"/><!--pb/@n='8'--> 
<lb/>ascending up the river that they 
<lb/>begged me to take others. I took 
<lb/>24  the wood cutting required is really 
<lb/>heart breaking. I beg you to 
<lb/>examine <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rae</persName> all about the 
<lb/>vessel and everything else. I don<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>wish to hide an iota from you. </p>
<lb/><p>I come down now though the 
<lb/>bottom is all patched and continually 
<lb/>breaking out afresh in order to 
<lb/>get <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rae</persName> safely off and <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi>
<lb/>Kirk's</persName> specimens with him. I 
<lb/>would have gone up the <placeName>Makololo 
<lb/>Country</placeName> at once - but felt perplexed 
<lb/>as to whether you will send us another 
<lb/>steamer - the loss of the mail bag 
<lb/>leaving us in the dark. We heard 
<lb/>at <placeName>Senna</placeName> that the mail bag had 
<lb/>been found &amp; taken by a native 
<lb/>to <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> &amp; passed us on the way 
<lb/>down from <placeName>Tette</placeName><reg>.</reg> Ever yours </p>
