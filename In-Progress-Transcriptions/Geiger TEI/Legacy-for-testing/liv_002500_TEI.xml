<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> 24 August 1866 </p>
<lb/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My very Dear Friend 
<lb/><space extent="5" unit="words"/>I have taken a sore longing 
<lb/>to write to you though I have not the faintest prospect 
<lb/>of being able to send a letter to the sea coast. The Arab 
<lb/>slave traders on their way thither avoid me as if I had the 
<lb/>plague. In six or seven cases they set off across country 
<lb/>as soon as they heard that the English were coming - 
<lb/>and dashing through bush and brake here is a more serious 
<lb/>affair than with you for the grass is generally over one<reg>'</reg>s 
<lb/>head in the hollows - as thick as a quill in the stalk &amp; 
<lb/>often intertwined with creepers - I would fain have spared 
<lb/>the slaves who were thus dragged, but the masters took care 
<lb/>not to look me in the face. One sagacious old leader 
<lb/>who had about 800 slaves in his party, hearing that after 
<lb/>a march of eight days through a fine country completely 
<lb/>depopulated by the slave trade, we were nearly famished, 
<lb/>and that we were just at hand, came forward &amp; presented 
<lb/>a bag of flour and an ox. I daresay he had some 
<lb/>genuine goodness in him though it looked like taking the 
<lb/>"bull by the horns," <del type="strikethrough">for</del> I had only three or four of the strongest 
<lb/>of our party, and we were making a forced march in order 
<lb/>to purchase &amp; send back provisions to the weaker still behind 
<lb/>but this was the only chance we had of sending a letter, 
<lb/>and our friend could not wait till we had written. He 
<lb/>was beginning that long march which we had just 
<lb/>finished, and every hour to him was precious. </p>
<lb/><p>To give you an idea of the country it is a gradual 
<lb/>slope from the coast up to within forty or fifty miles of 
<lb/>this Lake. The first 80 miles or so are covered with dense 
<lb/>forest, the only bare spaces being the clearings of the 
<lb/>inhabitants. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he rock where it can be seen is coarse 
<lb/>grey sandstone with blocks of salicified wood lying on it. 
<lb/>This overlies coal. Beyond the sandstone we came on 
<lb/>gneiss and sometimes granite. There the forest is scraggy 
<lb/>but it is still so thickly planted that one can rarely 
<lb/>see the horizon. About 200 miles inland the country 
<lb/>becomes undulating and on the crests of the waves one 
<lb/>sees mountains all around - great rounded granitic 
<lb/>masses - igneous rocks appear among these masses 
<lb/>and large patches of ferruginous conglomerate are 
<lb/>met with. The country is still rich in soil but the 
<lb/>trees are small as we attain greater altitude - and the 
<lb/>number of running rills in the mountainous 
<lb/>district is quite astonishing. I counted in one day's 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002500_0002"/><!--pb/@n='232r'-->
<lb/>march no fewer than fifteen flowing burns - These 
<lb/>are the sources of the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>. The watershed between 
<lb/>it and the Lake rises up to 3400 <add place="above">&amp; even 4000 ft</add> feet. This elevated region 
<lb/>is just Magomero magnified, and to this poor 
<lb/><persName>bishop Mackenzie</persName> hoped to extend his mission - I had 
<lb/>to wear my thickest flannels. The water though only 
<lb/>61ยบ felt much too cold to bathe in. Cattle shewed that no 
<lb/>tsetse exists, and large patches of English peas in full 
<lb/>bearing shewed how English vegetables could flourish. 
<lb/>The most influential chief on these highlands is <persName>Mataka</persName> 
<lb/>of <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> or <term type="tribe">Waiyou</term> extraction. Some of his people 
<lb/>had without his knowledge gone to the Lake and carried 
<lb/>off a number of cattle &amp; people. <persName>Mataka</persName> had ordered 
<lb/>them to be taken back before we arrived, but I accidentally 
<lb/>saw the party. The women &amp; children numbered 54. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>young men and boys about a dozen, but they were <add place="above">then</add> employed 
<lb/>among the cattle which were about 80 head in all - this 
<lb/>spontaneous act was the more creditable inasmuchas 
<lb/>he has been subjected to none but slave trading influences. 
<lb/>And all through this region the process which <persName>bishop 
<lb/>Mackenzie</persName> stemmed goes on annually - The <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> 
<lb/>or <term type="tribe">Waiyou</term> make the forays, and the Arabs furnish the 
<lb/>powder &amp; guns - I look at this fine region fast becoming 
<lb/>depopulated with feelings of inexpressible sadness - 
<lb/>We allow the <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> slave trade within certain limits, 
<lb/>and the effect of this license is, that insignificant island 
<lb/>is a great slave emporium and hundreds of miles of a 
<lb/>far finer country is annually swept of crowds of 
<lb/>people - our mission there is virtually gagged - The Sultan 
<lb/>is all civility &amp; flattery but no missionary progress 
<lb/>can be allowed among his <choice><sic>bigotted</sic><corr>bigoted</corr></choice><term type="tribe">Mahometans</term> - and 
<lb/>then about half the missionary strength must always 
<lb/>be absent in quest of health. It is almost enough to 
<lb/>make <persName>bp Mackenzie</persName> turn round in his grave to find his 
<lb/>mission degraded to a mere chaplaincy of a consulate - 
<lb/>and I fear that there is no hope of seeing central 
<lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName> occupied by its mission in our day. I was 
<lb/>very much delayed by want of provisions, and by the 
<lb/>laziness of some sepoys whom I had to dismiss but 
<lb/>the easy boating of about three weeks <add place="above">to <placeName>Magomero</placeName></add> will bear 
<lb/>no comparison to the few months hard toil we 
<lb/>had in coming here. When we see how <choice><sic>bigotted</sic><corr>bigoted</corr></choice> &amp; 
<lb/>unfriendly the coast tribes are how friendly 
<lb/>the people in the interior prove themselves I 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>clude</w> that <placeName>Africa</placeName> must be Christianized from within. 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002500_0003"/><!--pb/@n='233r'-->
<lb/>Wherever a path may be found I can <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> of none 
<lb/>superior to that by the <placeName>Shire</placeName>. It is true we lost valuable 
<lb/>lives - the Arab who proved our friend in need told me 
<lb/>as a piece of news the <term type="tribe">Kilwa</term><term type="tribe">(Quilloa)</term> slave traders 
<lb/>had lost one hundred of their number in one sickly 
<lb/>year. I saw several of their graves, and surely the church 
<lb/>can afford to spend lives in saving as freely as others 
<lb/>can in destroying. But after all I have hopes in the 
<lb/>church yet and I cannot believe that all the hopes 
<lb/>prayers and sympathies which clustered around 
<lb/>my poor Dear friend are to go into thin air. </p>
<lb/><p>I ought to have mentioned that on the highest part of the 
<lb/>watershed we had mica schist - and then when we come 
<lb/>down here the gneiss is thrust away from the Lake &amp; tilted 
<lb/>right on edge. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he strata often dipping quite perpendicularly 
<lb/>but I can see no agent that thus thrust it away. It felt 
<lb/>like coming to an old home to see <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> again and 
<lb/>dash in the rollers of its delicious waters - I was quite 
<lb/>exhilarated by the roar of this inland sea. The people 
<lb/>have generally been friendly with us - though from their 
<lb/>intercourse with coast Arabs they have learned some 
<lb/>of their ways suspicion has not taken root. I have 
<lb/>not yet learned that any Arab has endeavoured 
<lb/>to propagate Mahometanism. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>heir zeal for that faith 
<lb/>seems to have perished and without being uncharitable 
<lb/>I don<reg>'</reg>t think they have much of it themselves. </p>
<lb/><p>I have been rather surprised at finding an undoubted 
<lb/>testimony that even where polygamy has free scope 
<lb/>the <term type="ailment">venereal disease</term> is rampant. Two English 
<lb/>medical officers assured me that they had seen nothing 
<lb/>like its prevalence in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. One of these officers 
<lb/>was so scandalized on finding what we call respectable 
<lb/>married men with it that he threatened to complain 
<lb/>to the Sultan. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his says little for polygamy. </p>
<lb/><p>I have several times recollected a remark 
<lb/>made by the <persName>Dean of <placeName>Ely</placeName></persName> in your house that he might 
<lb/>be able to do something to promote the education 
<lb/>of my children. I did not think much about it 
<lb/>at the time but it has since struck me that if I had 
<lb/>the opportunity I would tell him that I shall esteem 
<lb/>it a great kindness if he in any way remembers 
<lb/>them. I am rather oddly situated as to friends. 
<lb/>I have a great many sincere true hearted ones 
<lb/>for whose favour I feel very grateful - to 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002500_0004"/><!--pb/@n='234r'-->
<lb/>them for their favour and to Him who disposes 
<lb/>their hearts to feel kindly towards me. <choice><reg>B</reg><orig>b</orig></choice>ut again &amp; again 
<lb/>I have been left in the lurch. One mentions some new 
<lb/>and most interesting book - "I would have sent it" he 
<lb/>adds "but you have so many friends, I am sure some one 
<lb/>must have sent it." So with news. They are sure some 
<lb/>of my "many friends" must have given all. <del type="strikethrough">As he</del>
<lb/>mentioned education spontaneously it seemed as if he 
<lb/>were not one of the many who feel that others are so 
<lb/>much more liberal than themselves. I have one son 
<lb/>at <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> college sixteen years of age - another at a 
<lb/>private school in <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> about ten years of age<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Should the Dean wish any information about 
<lb/>them <persName>Professor Andrew Buchanan</persName> of <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>
<lb/>would supply it - or <persName>James Young</persName> - <placeName>Limefield</placeName> - 
<lb/><placeName>West Calder</placeName> - <placeName>Scotland</placeName> * another of their <choice><sic>gaurdians</sic><corr>guardians</corr></choice>. 
<lb/>The Dean may have nothing at his disposal 
<lb/>but I do not value his kindly feelings the less 
<lb/>and I am sure that you will excuse my asking 
<lb/>you to give the above information at your 
<lb/><choice><sic>leizure</sic><corr>leisure</corr></choice>. I think of you as I saw you last at <placeName>Norwich</placeName>
<lb/>and beg you present my salaam to <persName>Mary Bell</persName>
<lb/>and to any of your <choice><sic>Boquet</sic><corr>bouquet</corr></choice> of flowers you may 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">get</unclear>. I leave a little space to fill up when I see 
<lb/>a prospect of sending a letter<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/>I have been a long time in working up to what is probably 
<lb/>the watershed I seek - 4500 feet above the sea &amp; the <placeName>Loapula</placeName>
<lb/>in front. A hungry time we had in passing through the 
<lb/>dripping forests of the <placeName>Babisa</placeName> country - no animals to be 
<lb/>shot and the people had no grain to sell. Mushrooms 
<lb/>in plenty though but woes me good only for exciting 
<lb/>dreams of the roast beef of bygone days - no salt either<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>This causes the gnawing sensation to be ceaseless but 
<lb/>we got through by God's great mercy. Sugar we 
<lb/>have forgotten all about &amp; roast a little grain to make 
<lb/>believe it is coffee but we have got to a land of 
<lb/>plenty &amp; are going to have our <choice><reg>C</reg><orig>c</orig></choice>hristmas feast tomorrow<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We had nothing to celebrate it when the day passed but 
<lb/>won<reg>'</reg>t <unclear cert="low">we talked</unclear> of it for all that. I am excessively 
<lb/>lean but take on fat kindly as do some races of 
<lb/>pigs. I have heard nothing of home since we left 
<lb/>the coast but pray that the Most High may keep all 
<lb/>my dear friends &amp; relatives among I am glad 
<lb/>to place my very dear
