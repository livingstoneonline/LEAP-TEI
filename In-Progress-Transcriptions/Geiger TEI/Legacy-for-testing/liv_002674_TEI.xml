<lb/><p rend="right"><space extent="2" unit="words"/>12 Nov<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> 1859</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="1" unit="chars"/>Having this day finished 
<lb/>my first perusal of your admirable 
<lb/>memoir of an admirable man, 
<lb/>which by the way you forgot to send 
<lb/>after me. I feel that I must write 
<lb/>to you. No wonder you were affected 
<lb/>in preaching the funeral sermon 
<lb/>of the good and great <persName>General Havelock</persName>
<lb/>such a lovely character - so exalted a 
<lb/>christian and yet so human - so 
<lb/>sympathizing, and yet so brave. I can 
<lb/>enter better into your feelings now 
<lb/>and I trust this labour of love 
<lb/>of yours will become a blessing 
<lb/>unto many.</p>
<lb/><p>Here we are away 
<lb/>from the exciting themes which 
<lb/>agitate the public mind at home 
<lb/>and we are working towards a great 
<lb/>object in the hope that the Lord 
<lb/>may in mercy accept our 
<lb/>services and grant us our desires. 
<lb/>At first matters appeared 
<w>un-<lb break="no"/>toward</w> but these very hindrances 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002674_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>now promise to turn out signally in 
<lb/>our favour. We have been longer 
<lb/>in the lower portion of the river than we 
<lb/>anticipated but our opportunities for 
<lb/>observing the fever - and trying the plan 
<lb/>which I followed when alone have 
<lb/>been more numerous in consequence, 
<lb/>and I believe we can now cure the disease 
<lb/>quickly and without (in general) loss 
<lb/>of strength to the patient. This is one of 
<lb/>the greatest boons our Expedition will have 
<lb/>to shew. We cannot however cure the brandy 
<lb/>fever but country fever and it are two diseases<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Then we have been led to go up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>and we found that this river comes out 
<lb/>of a large Lake called <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. The region 
<lb/>bathed by Lake &amp; river is one of the 
<lb/>finest cotton countries in the world - 
<lb/>there are no frosts to cut off the crops 
<lb/>as in America and instead of the 
<w>un-<lb break="no"/>merciful</w> toil required in the slave states 
<lb/>one sowing of foreign seed serves for 
<lb/>three years crops. In the cotton country 
<lb/>we have highlands which present changes 
<lb/>of climate within a few miles of each 
<lb/>other for we can ascend from the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>valley where the thermometer stands about 
<lb/>96ยบ in the shade and the river water is 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002674_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>81ยบ - 84ยบ or like a warm bath at home to 
<lb/>a heights of from 3000 to 7000 feet, well 
<lb/>cultivated and peopled too, in the course 
<lb/>of a short day<reg>'</reg>s journey. The people 
<lb/>even now cultivate large quantities of 
<lb/>cotton and the problem of supply of the 
<lb/>raw material of our manufactures 
<lb/>without <choice><sic>dependance</sic><corr>dependence</corr></choice> on slave labour 
<lb/>seems verging towards a <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="deletion"/>
<lb/>solution. The region referred to is 
<lb/>a large section of the slave market. We 
<lb/>saw abundant evidence of this everywhere 
<lb/>and here English settlements would in 
<lb/>the course of time be an incalculable 
<lb/>benefit. Lawful commerce as a 
<lb/>means of counteracting that in slaves 
<lb/>but above everything the gospel 
<lb/>which is the only remedy for the woes 
<lb/>of Africa and the only means which 
<lb/>can effectually raise the degraded 
<lb/>portions of humanity would here find 
<lb/>a most eligible field. I believe that 
<lb/>something is in contemplation &amp; 
<lb/>if only carried out with vigour 
<lb/>our efforts will be rewarded - &amp; I shall 
<lb/>not grieve at being detained so long 
<lb/>from the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>.</p>

<lb/><p rend="no-indent">It gives me much pleasure to see 
<lb/>from some of the Papers that our 
<lb/>Friend <persName>Binney</persName> is recovered and 
<lb/>has been doing some good in Australia<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>If he is home and you happen 
<lb/>to meet him please tell him that 
<lb/>I am greatly rejoiced to hear of his 
<lb/>welfare &amp; usefulness - should you 
<lb/>see <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Spurgeon</persName> the same thing 
<lb/>will do for him - I love them 
<lb/>both with very great affection<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The Lord make them &amp; you my 
<lb/>brother - abundant blessings. I am 
<lb/>in apparently another line but I know 
<lb/>what I am about. I had a naval officer 
<lb/>who didn't. He came out I found not 
<lb/>to elevate the African and prepare the 
<lb/>way for the gospel but "to discover the 
<lb/>Ten lost Tribes" as if of all things in 
<lb/>the world we hadn't plenty of Jews 
<lb/>already. I had to send him home soon<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We came down here to meet a man of 
<lb/>war with provisions and tinker our 
<lb/>craft with which we were cheated by 
<lb/>a philanthropist (so called)<reg>.</reg> Please present
