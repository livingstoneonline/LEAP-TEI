<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Sir Roderick</persName>
<lb/><space extent="4" unit="words"/>Feeling in honour 
<lb/>bound to take the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> back to their own 
<lb/>country, and disliking the idea of coming 
<lb/>to a stand still while waiting for news 
<lb/>of a real steamer, we started on the 16<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> of May 
<lb/>from <placeName>Tette</placeName> and in three months 
<w>accom-<lb break="no"/>plished</w> a distance of some six hundred miles<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>During the five years sojourn at <placeName>Tette</placeName>
<lb/>many of the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> had married slave 
<lb/>women and had families - As they were 
<lb/>chiefly of the subject tribes and scarcely 
<lb/>in contact with <persName>Sekeletu's</persName> government 
<lb/>at home I expected that many would 
<lb/>prefer remaining at <placeName>Tette</placeName> to going home. 
<lb/>In their way of effecting this they shewed 
<lb/>the evil influence of contact with slavery 
<lb/>for though repeatedly requested to follow their 
<lb/>own choice in the matter they preferred running 
<lb/>away while we were on the march. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>seemed to have less honour than when they 
<lb/>were in the interior. </p>
<lb/><p>Our route lay along the North bank of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> - crossing the mountain mass 
<lb/>in which <placeName>Kebrabasa</placeName> lies, and the Loangua 
<lb/>&amp; Kafue at their confluences. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen along 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001581_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>the fine fertile valley in which the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>gently flows (being new ground) for about 
<lb/>100 miles - then turning Westward in Lat 
<lb/>17° 18′ S. up a sandy river <add place="above">(the Zangue) Zongue</add> till we saw the 
<lb/>source of the fragments of coal strewed on it's 
<lb/>bed - Ascended about 2000 feet above the 
<lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice><placeName>Zambese</placeName> or 3300 feet above the level 
<lb/>of the sea to the base of <placeName>Tabacheu</placeName> - breathed 
<lb/>for a short time the clear cold reviving air 
<lb/>of the Highlands and actually saw hoar
<lb/>frost and a little ice. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen descended into 
<lb/>the great valley of the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term>.//When within 
<lb/>20 miles of <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName> we could see the 
<lb/>columns of vapour with the naked eye. 
<lb/><choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd there I could not resist the temptation of 
<lb/>acting the showman to my companions 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> and <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> C. Livingstone</persName>, though by diverging 
<lb/>from our straight course to <placeName>Sesheke</placeName> we added 
<lb/>some forty miles to our tramp. After a second 
<lb/>visit I think that I have overstated nothing 
<lb/>about them except the height of the columns 
<lb/>of vapour - but I could not measure their 
<lb/>altitude. The river was now very low and 
<lb/>there was no danger in going down to my 
<lb/>garden island on the lip of the fizzure for a 
<lb/>large space on the left was dry. You may 
<lb/>add 100 feet to the fall and say 200 feet. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he 
<lb/>crack is of the shape of the letter <figure><!--<graphic url="LETT1127-1.gif"/>--></figure>. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he hippopotami 
<lb/>had eaten all my trees, so henceforth we shall 
<lb/>have war with them to the knife. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are 
<lb/>good food half beef &amp; half pork &amp; lots of fat 
<lb/>that serves as butter. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is part of the <hi rend="underline">casus belli</hi><reg>.</reg>

<lb/>By the way our good friend <persName>Professor Owen</persName> and the 
<lb/>gastronomic committee will stand very much 
<lb/>in their own light if the she Giraffes die a natural 
<lb/>death. If they praised the <choice><sic>Eiland</sic><corr>Eland</corr></choice> so, which we 
<w>con-<lb break="no"/>sider</w> but so so, a dinner of she giraffe will leave 
<lb/>them all lying on their backs. </p>
<lb/><p>Our plan of returning is to pass <placeName>Victoria Falls</placeName>
<lb/>and by canoes at <placeName>Sinamanes</placeName>, then drop down 
<lb/>the stream so as to be at the sea in November. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his

<lb/><placeName>Falls</placeName> to <placeName>Mosilikatze</placeName> and thence to <placeName>Kuruman</placeName><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>We found <persName>Sekeletu</persName> labouring under a skin 
<lb/>disease believed to  leprosy the effect of course 
<lb/>of witchcraft and several headmen had been 
<lb/>executed for the alledged crime - many influential 
<lb/>men had died of fever and the tribe is altogether 
<lb/>in a shaky condition. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are anxious generally 
<lb/>to go to the <placeName>Highlands</placeName> and were much disappointed 
<lb/>at my not bringing <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">rs</hi> L</persName>.; for all believe that 
<lb/>she or any number of <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Moffat<reg>'</reg>s</persName> family would 
<lb/>be a protection to them against <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>. </p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey have not neglected the opening made to 
<lb/>West coast though the first party which you 
<lb/>may remember reached <placeName>Loanda</placeName> under the 
<lb/>direction of an Arab before I reached <placeName>England</placeName>
<lb/>in 1855-6 never returned - it consisted of 
<lb/>ninety five persons and I conjecture that the Arab 
<lb/>wheedled them over to where his countrymen 
<lb/>are in power on pretence of finding horses for 
<lb/><persName>Sekeletu</persName> - overpowered &amp; sold them all as French 
<lb/>free emigrants. Another party was sent to purchase 
<lb/>a horse I happened to ride at <placeName>Pungo Andongo</placeName> in 
<lb/><placeName>Angola</placeName>. It is now at <placeName>Sesheke</placeName>; and a third party 
<lb/>had just returned from <placeName>Benguella</placeName> on the West 
<lb/>coast. A fourth party is out now. I could not 
<lb/>find out that the law promulgated by <persName>Sekeletu</persName>
<lb/>seven years ago against selling children to slave

<lb/>traders has ever been publicly violated but the 
<lb/>subject tribes are so numerous &amp; many live 
<lb/>200 or 300 miles from the capital <del type="strikethrough">and</del> <add place="above">that</add> I suspect 
<lb/>secret transactions of the kind have taken place 
<lb/>among them. During our months sojourn here 
<lb/>we have been treated to tea, American biscuits 
<lb/>and preserved fruits daily. We have tried to 
<lb/>cure <persName>Sekeletu<reg>'</reg>s</persName> complaint and he is recovering; 
<lb/>but time &amp; patience are requisite for the cure. It 
<lb/>is probably an obstinate skin disease &amp; not leprosy<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>But I must tell you that we were saddened 
<lb/>by the loss of a party of <placeName>London</placeName> missionaries 
<lb/>as we suppose by Fever at <placeName>Linyanti</placeName>. Six out of 
<lb/>nine Europeans perished in three months. By 
<lb/>a remedy first tried on my own children at 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Ngami</placeName> in 1850, we at a lower &amp; more 
<lb/>unhealthy part of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>, cured severe cases 
<lb/>of the complaint in Europeans so quickly, 
<lb/>that our march was rarely interrupted more 
<lb/>than a day or two - a man stricken prostrate 
<lb/>was sometimes able to resume <del type="strikethrough">our</del> <add place="above">his</add> march on 
<lb/>foot a day after the operation of the remedy. 
<lb/><choice><reg>A</reg><orig>a</orig></choice>nd this while those good people were 
<lb/>helplessly perishing. The proper medicines too 
<lb/>to for its composition were found by me in 
<lb/>the waggon, which has been carefully 
<lb/><choice><sic>guarded</sic><corr>gaurded</corr></choice> for seven years. <choice><reg>W</reg><orig>w</orig></choice>ithin a few hundred 
<lb/>yards of their graves. I think it is mentioned 
<lb/>near the end of the "Missionary Travels" which 
<lb/>you made me write - but I am now anxious 
<lb/>that it become generally known. And there is 
<lb/>great difficulty in the matter. Medicines so often 
<lb/><choice><sic>deceive</sic><corr>decieve</corr></choice> people - panaceas in one hand and 
<lb/>nonentities in another I have however never 
<lb/>failed to cure during ten years. With very kind 
<lb/>salutations to <persName>Lady Murchison</persName> I am &amp;c <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
