<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Captain Washington</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/><space extent="2" unit="chars"/>We have lost at least 
<lb/>three months by the Pioneer being too 
<lb/>deep and too long for these East African 
<lb/>rivers. I am not disposed to find 
<lb/>fault with her as a ship for she is an 
<lb/>excellent, strong, and well furnished 
<lb/>vessel. She is besides a comfortable 
<lb/>home for us when we are on board, but 
<lb/>lighten her as we may, she touches at 
<lb/>five feet. I saw enough of her in the 
<lb/><placeName>Rovuma</placeName> to make me believe that 
<lb/>she will not do there except in running 
<lb/>up in flood and remaining till next 
<lb/>season. In the <placeName>Shire</placeName> we have abundance 
<lb/>of water for her the whole year, up to the 
<lb/><placeName>Elephant marsh</placeName>. Above that it is 4 1/2 
<lb/>feet. We warped her through this for 
<lb/>the sake of the Missionaries, and to 
<lb/>secure a healthy spot for those who 
<lb/>should remain in her while we were 
<lb/>away, but we could not come down 
<lb/>again till the water rose, for a bank 
<lb/>forms at once on our lee as soon as 
<lb/>she touches. If it were possible for you 
<lb/>to sell her to those Australians to whom 
<lb/>you wrote respecting a steamer for 
<lb/>surveying, and give us another <add place="above">an iron one</add> with 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001715_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2'--> 
<lb/>the price drawing when loaded not more 
<lb/>than three feet we should be able to 
<lb/>navigate all the rivers on this coast<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Speed is not of much consequence but 
<lb/>light draught most certainly is. I mention 
<lb/>this not by way of grumbling but in the 
<lb/>belief if you can do anything to make 
<lb/>us more efficient, you will continue 
<lb/>your goodness to us. She leaks not a 
<lb/>drop. Engines perfect except a little damage 
<lb/>to the paddle wheels, and you could recommend 
<lb/>her for strength, in hulk &amp; machinery. </p>
<lb/><p>We shall warp her up again to the cataracts, 
<lb/>and keep there till we launch the other on 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. A letter from <persName>Col<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Rigby</persName> to <persName>Sir 
<lb/>George Grey</persName> says that <hi rend="underline">"if it should ever be 
<lb/>found possible to put a steamer on <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Nyassa</placeName> it will cut off the chief supply of 
<lb/>slaves to the East Coast."</hi> To effect this I 
<lb/>earnestly pray that the Almighty may spare 
<lb/>my life. In view of having succeeded 
<lb/>and wishing for an outlet for the cotton 
<lb/>away from the Portuguese a steamer of 
<lb/>light draught would be an immense 
<lb/>advantage. I lay the matter before you 
<lb/>and I know that you will not put 
<lb/>it as if I did not know what I would 
<lb/>be at next. If it cannot be done we 
<lb/>shall do the best we can with the Pioneer. </p>
<lb/><p>I see that <persName>M. Chaillu</persName> has brought 
<lb/>home some sixty new birds and that they 
<lb/>will be bought by the British Museum<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> C Livingstone</persName> &amp; <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Kirk</persName> have made 
<lb/>collections of birds, insects, and plants - 
<lb/>which are sent home to be kept at the 
<lb/>Kew Museum till they arrive themselves. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey know that the British Museum 
<lb/>has the choice of all, for not taking 
<lb/>charge of the collections <add place="above">myself</add> I always said 
<lb/>that these were Government property - 
<lb/>and to first offer must be made 
<lb/>to the Museum. It occurs to me that 
<lb/>many of our birds may be new &amp; 
<lb/>might be substituted for those to be 
<lb/>bought if the Museum authorities 
<lb/>would only examine, and take what 
<lb/>they wished - the plants are registered 
<lb/>by <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hooker</persName> and I suppose that 
<lb/>all may be left with him till the 
<lb/>arrival of the collector whose knowledge 
<lb/>of the plants will be most advantageous 
<lb/>in classification. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Portuguese have got a small steamer 
<lb/>similar to the Ma Robert for the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>this is to secure "all merchandise for the 
<lb/>river to be under the national flag", as she 
<lb/>will look after the big canoes<reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he necessity 
<lb/>for securing our own outlet by <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>becomes every day more decided. If you 
<lb/>hear of any disaster befalling us please 
<lb/>suspend your judgment till you hear
<lb/>from us. I shall give you the earliest 
<lb/>information possible. I say this because 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001715_0004"/><!--pb/@n='4'--> 
<lb/>the Portuguese continually get up 
<w>unfavour-<lb break="no"/>able</w> reports - such as that one or two of us 
<lb/>has been killed by the natives or we are floundered 
<lb/>on a rock - lately a report was rife at 
<lb/><placeName>Mozambique</placeName> that we were aground in the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> - and again that we were sticking 
<lb/>between two rocks in the <placeName>Shire</placeName> - the only thing 
<lb/>untoward is that delay I have mentioned in 
<lb/>page 1<hi rend="sup underline">st</hi> of this. We have lost time by 
<lb/>waiting till the river rose in a part to which 
<lb/>it may be said we ought not to have gone. </p>
<lb/><p>Thanks for <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Petherick's</persName> speech = our 
<lb/>work will be more of a stationary nature 
<lb/>for some time to come. Will you send us 
<lb/><persName>Maury's</persName> work? and anything African 
<lb/>the<persName>Viscount de Sáda Bandeira</persName> has 
<lb/>published all  that the Portuguese minister 
<lb/>could muster of geography "ancient &amp; modern" 
<lb/>of this region. It is all from our maps 
<lb/>except the <placeName>Loangua</placeName> (of <placeName>Zumbo - Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>called <placeName>Arroangoa</placeName> by the Portuguese) which 
<lb/>is made to come out of the North end of 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa!</placeName> While <placeName>Shire</placeName> arises N.W. of the 
<lb/>cateracts! I have only seen a tracing from 
<lb/>his map. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Hardisty</persName> valued the carpenter's tools 
<lb/>at £4-10. and we keep them for use. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he river is up and we go down 
<lb/>as fast as we can cut wood - never saw 
<lb/><placeName>Shire</placeName> bringing down so much rubbish &amp;
