<lb/>begin when you were so often on the 
<lb/>point of writing but didn't? This 
<lb/>that you have accomplished is so 
<lb/>far good but very short. Hope you 
<lb/>are not yet too old to learn. You 
<lb/>have heard of our hindrances and 
<lb/>annoyances and possibly that 
<lb/>we have done some work notwith
<lb/>standing. It was galling to find that 
<lb/>our "sickly sheep" was what may 
<lb/>termed an Evangelical of the 
<lb/>ultra or mad school that believes

<lb/>at the bidding of any ass who has nothing 
<lb/>else to do - but thanks to Providence 
<lb/>we have made some progress and it 
<lb/>is likely our operations will yet have 
<lb/>a decided effect on slave trading in 
<lb/>Eastern Africa. I am greatly delighted 
<lb/>with the prospect of a church of 
<lb/>England mission to Central Africa 
<lb/>that is a good omen for those 
<lb/>who are sitting in darkness and I 
<lb/>trust that in process of time great 
<lb/>benefits will be conferred on our

<lb/>home. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>here is room enough and

<lb/><p>I like to hear that some abuse me 
<lb/>now and say that I am no Christian<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Many good things were said of me 
<lb/>which I did not deserve and I feared 
<lb/>to read them. I shall read every word 
<lb/>I can on the other side and that 
<lb/>will prove a sedative to what I was 
<lb/>forced to hear of an opposite tendency. 
<lb/>I pray that He who has lifted me 
<lb/>up and guided me thus far will 
<lb/>not desert me now but make 
<lb/>me useful in my day &amp; generation 
<lb/>"I will never leave thee nor forsake 
<lb/>thee" So let it be</p>
<lb/><p>I have felt no regret at leaving 
<lb/>the association to which you refer 
<lb/>but felt a pang in prospect of parting 
<lb/>with the sympathies of so many who 
<lb/>would be <unclear cert="low">led</unclear> to consider me as parted

<lb/>being free from the Executive whose 
<lb/>nature you understand, and Please 
<lb/>God I shall be more useful than 
<lb/>could have been under them. I saw

<lb/>been searched for <unclear cert="medium">excellencies</unclear> they might 
<lb/>have seen a certain cure for <term type="illness">African Fever</term>
<lb/>We were curing it at a lower &amp; worse 
<lb/>part of the river at the very time that they 
<lb/>were helplessly perishing and so quickly 
<lb/>more than a day was never lost after 
<lb/>the operation of that remedy though we were 
<lb/>marching on foot. Our tramp was 
<lb/>over 600 miles - We dropped downstream
