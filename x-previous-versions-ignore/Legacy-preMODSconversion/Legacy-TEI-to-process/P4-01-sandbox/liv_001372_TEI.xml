<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Thompson</persName></p>
<lb/><p>I could not possibly 
<lb/>write you by last opportunity 
<lb/>from the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> but there was 
<lb/>so little to communicate you 
<lb/>were no loser. We have now 
<lb/>had more time to look about us 
<lb/>and I think we have ascertained 
<lb/>the point that entering these
<lb/>rivers at the time we did is 
<lb/>nearly quite safe if no delay 
<lb/>takes place among the mangrove 
<lb/>swamps. We have been 
<lb/>favoured with fair health 
<lb/>and had ailments more 
<lb/>like common colds than 
<lb/>fever. Two of the party are 
<lb/>now at <placeName>Tete</placeName> and the others

<lb/>hope to join them shortly. We got 
<lb/>a ton and a half of coals there 
<lb/>the first ever taken out of the 
<lb/>earth in that country and as 
<lb/>the Portuguese have shewn 
<lb/>a great deal of public spirit 
<lb/>we are almost certain of a 
<lb/>larger supply when we return<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>My poor fellows <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>
<lb/>me with great joy - they 
<lb/>had often been taunted by 
<lb/>the <placeName>Tette</placeName> people that their 
<lb/>Englishman would never 
<lb/>return but they hoped on 
<lb/>and have amassed quantities 
<lb/>of beads to take back to their 
<lb/>own country. Thirty of them 
<lb/>died of <term type="ailment">small pox</term> and 
<lb/>six were killed by a 
<lb/>rebel chief at the confluence 
<lb/>of the <placeName>Luenya</placeName>. The confidential 
<lb/>servant of <persName>Sekwebu</persName> is with 
<lb/>me now on board the Launch.

<lb/>could not bring more of them 
<lb/>down though they were anxious 
<lb/>to come on service.</p>
<lb/><p>We found the country in a 
<lb/>state of war and the Portuguese 
<lb/>were too busy with that to help 
<lb/>us with canoes. It is finished 
<lb/>now, and my old friend 
<lb/><persName>Major Secard</persName> at once helped 
<lb/>us with the luggage - but it 
<lb/>has quite depopulated the 
<lb/>lands adjacent to the river<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We see the river in this 
<lb/>month at its very lowest 
<lb/>and as it spreads out 
<lb/>into from one to three 
<lb/>miles in width the 
<lb/>broad parts are very 
<lb/>difficult. When we 
<lb/>get to <placeName>Lupata</placeName> our 
<lb/>difficulties vanish for 
<lb/>above that point it 
<lb/>is in one or two channels 
<lb/>of about 1000 or 1200 yards broad<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>I admire its size more than ever. 
<lb/>When I came down in a canoe 
<lb/>it was full and I saw but one 
<lb/>channel where we now see two 
<lb/>or three. If the Portuguese would 
<lb/>beat the expense of a few piles 
<lb/>driven in to effect what snags 
<lb/>sometimes do now - deep channels 
<lb/>might be secured for the whole 
<lb/>year. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are going to build a 
<lb/>fort &amp; custom house at this 
<lb/>or the <placeName>Luabo</placeName></p>
<lb/><p>Your things left at Kilimane 
<lb/>did not go off by sale, so I 
<lb/>have directed my friend there 
<lb/>to send them back to the Cape 
<lb/>at my expense - and possibly they may realize the sum 
<lb/>which the Directors I think 
<lb/>most unjustly saddled upon you<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I promised to pay it all 
<lb/>but wished to think over it, 
<lb/>and now I consider that the 
<lb/>publication of that same document 
<lb/>in England ought to have been 
<lb/>defrayed by the secretaries if 
<lb/>they thought you were liable too.</p>
