<pb/> appears to throw off part of paragraph that follows so that it is too far right
http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search?f[]=dateRangeYear_mi%3A%221860%22&f[]=addressee_ms%3A%22Gray%2C+Robert%2C+1809-1872%22&view_pid=liv%3A001550&view_page=1

<p rend="right"> and <p> seem not to be interacting appropriately as a line break after the first is not being added or it is otherwise messing up the letter header

There are also issues with <p rend="right"> at the end of a letter:

Why is rend="underline" coming up as a tooltip on this page?

<supplied> text is kicking in unnecessary space inside the square brackers. Toggle to edited text on the following page, then look at the last word: David Livingst [ one ]  should be David Livingst[one] Note also that a rdg tooltip should be display on this word, but is not. Instead, the <rdg> take is adding a second unnecessary empty space in front of the square brackets.

<salut> is displaying too far to the right

Text between lines is displaying oddly. See the end of this page:

<placeName><region> seems to be kicking in an extra space before and after the relevant term. See the phrase "Bechuana Country" about six lines down on this page:

<p rend="center"> is breaking lines early. Additionally, in the following example an opening line break is being kicked in for <note> when it shouldn't be:

<figDes> text show as generic rendering: "illustration". See about line 33 on this page:

<p> is not indenting

<gap>, <hi rend="sup underline">, and <supplied> are kicking in an extra space in front

<placeName><geogName> and, separately, <space> are kicking out an extra space afterwards

<item> should not put in an extra line break
