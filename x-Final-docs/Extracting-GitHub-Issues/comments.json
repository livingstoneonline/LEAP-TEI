So, for instance, the subdirectory in File Browser for the \"Livingstone Online: An Introduction\" page (http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-this-site/livingstone-online-introduction) has the two images used to illustrate that page, but does not have the tile or carousel images for this page.\r\n\r\nCan you clarify the workflow for how I should edit, delete, add, etc. these grid and carousel images going forward?",

Rather you have to select the image, then navigate to the Files view (http://livingstoneonline.org/admin/content/file), find the image, then add alt text and title that way:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-31 at 22 35 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32259048-e50b39de-be8b-11e7-8713-bb474f221d55.png)\r\n\r\nThis works and then populates this text to the edit view from Content. In short, I can do it this way (and document that it needs to be done this way), but to avoid confusion in the future, it's probably best to remove the title and alt text boxes from the content edit view show in the first screen shot above. Also, is it possible to turn off the limit of how much title and alt text you can add? I hit a limit and couldn't add characters past a certain point.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) On the Repository page and the Catalogue, words with accents have an extra space in the middle. See screen shots.

However, on the Catalogue page at least the addressee and genre facets still appear to be incomplete. \r\n\r\nOne easy way to tell is to compare the list of Addressees on this page (http://livingstoneonline.org/in-his-own-words/catalogue) with the list on the Browse by Addressee page (http://livingstoneonline.org/in-his-own-words/addressee). You'll see that the latter page is showing lots of Addressees that are not making it onto the relevant Catalogue page facet.\r\n\r\nI also think that the failure to import this data issue may be carrying over to the Browse by Location page. See screen shot. For example, for location \"[Africa]\" (or Africa), we should have loads of pins in this location (-11.825556,25.135556) but there's only this one.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-05 at 16 00 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32420086-e0b3dedc-c24a-11e7-8966-a88f19ef73fc.png)\r\n"

    "body": "OK, great thanks for letting me know on all of this. Re those directories, in re-reviewing now I think they have to do with setting up the public facing version of this page that James previously created (http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-XSLT/), so I'll just leave them alone.\r\n\r\nRe: XSL & CSS, great. Makes sense. Thanks for clarifying that. In terms of this change (and the others related to this):\r\n\r\n> Basically almost all elements in a style sheet need to be prefixed with:\r\n> \r\n> div.transcription.STYLESHEET_ID ELEMENT\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this has to do with not having styling of elements in the HTML files interfere with similar elements on the pages in which these files are embedded in the site. Is that correct? I'll go ahead to keep the forward momentum going and close this ticket, but please confirm."

  "body": "I've finished my full review of the stage site against prod and only found a few minor issues, as follows:\r\n\r\n1) A handful of pages are not rendering in-text images. See attached zip. You can use the breadcrumbs in the screenshots to identify the pages.\r\n\r\n[Pages-with-missing-images.zip](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/files/1384963/Pages-with-missing-images.zip)\r\n\r\nHere's an example: \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-14 at 14 41 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/31579125-d5c62988-b0f4-11e7-88ce-5af0621cd6f8.png)\r\n\r\n2) The following pages are rendering H4 tags incorrectly (this might be an issue on other pages, but I only noticed these):\r\nhttp://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/1871-edition-guide\r\nhttp://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/tei-p5-encoding-guidelines\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-14 at 14 08 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/31579126-e43a7776-b0f4-11e7-8a40-00a227f1fb90.png)\r\n\r\n3) The line spacing on the captions on the following page is double what it should be. I looked in the coding and don't see the issue (this might be an issue on other pages, but I only noticed these):\r\nhttp://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-14 at 13 56 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/31579128-ec52da66-b0f4-11e7-87e3-fd5b1fdb8bc1.png)\r\n\r\n4) The table on this page is not quite rendering properly (compare against prod):\r\nhttp://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/terminology-and-acronyms\r\n\r\n5) I noticed one small theming issue. In the overview text, when there is no table of contents, the spacing between the overview text and gray line beneath is too large:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-14 at 13 28 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/31579130-ffd0ef6a-b0f4-11e7-969e-21b04cb8d015.png)\r\n",

On first visiting the page, you can drag the images around, but once you go to transcription view, then switch to a spectral image, it becomes difficult to drag the image around, and when you move the pointer onto the transcription the image still drags around. However, at a certain point it also locks and cannot be moved around and the zoom slider stops working. I'm using the trackpad rather than a mouse.",

When I display an html file in the multitext of manuscript viewer, I'd like a short bit of text to toggle an additional stylesheet on and off. \r\n\r\nSo, for instance, liv_002513_TEI.xml uses transcription.xsl for its transformation to HTML. Thanks to transcription.xsl, the HTML file points to the following stylesheets:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-XSLT/normalize.css\"/>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-XSLT/common.css\"/>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-XSLT/style.css\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to add an additional stylesheet, let's say style2.css. This stylesheet would not be applied like the others (by default), but rather in the HTML there would be bit of text enclosed in `<a>` that said \"Click me\" (for instance) and when that text was clicked, the additional stylesheet would be applied. If the text was clicked yet again, the stylesheet would be unapplied. \r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen the additional stylesheet should be given thus in the HTML file:\r\n\r\n`<link rel=\"stylesheet alternate\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-XSLT/style2.css\"/>`\r\n\r\nAnd the click and adding the additional stylesheet might be sorted out with some jquery or javascript in a `<script>` in the `<head>` of the `<html>`, but beyond that I've not been able to find the right formula or make the pieces work together since this is a bit out of my depth.",

In the standalone file, note that all text is properly aligned on the right:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-06 at 22 45 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32477501-50485544-c344-11e7-8508-cfb261f49528.png)\r\n\r\nIn the viewer, the text on the right is getting bunched up:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-06 at 22 45 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32477528-8df54c4e-c344-11e7-8c96-fef10845608a.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, take a look at the bottom of page 736. In the standalone, the text (from a table) is presented line after line: \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-06 at 22 51 04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32477623-461e1026-c345-11e7-97cf-feec32774d3a.png)\r\n\r\nIn the viewer, the text is getting extra space added between lines:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-06 at 22 51 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32477627-50831c8c-c345-11e7-8ff0-dd771f9899a0.png)\r\n\r\nThese same problems crop up when the file appears in the multitext viewer:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-06 at 22 55 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32477725-c006394a-c345-11e7-91db-ac1e87710ff5.png)\r\n\r\nI did some amount of work on the CSS and XSL files today and updated prod with the new versions. That's not the cause of this issue, I don't believe. Stage is still using the older versions of these files and the problems are there to, so it appears they were there before I did any work.",

    "body": "I've handle all the issues except for the h4 I don't want to override your style sheets globally in that case, it makes more sense for your to explicitly set the font sizes, etc for those elements in your css files for each xslt. \r\n\r\nMost of the issues stemmed from the user of a css reset sheet on the site (except for the h4 issue), of which there is non being used in your HTML page generated from the xslt. Theres really no way around it, there will be differences because they do different things, my recommendation is when you encounter a problem a difference just add a new rule to your xslt stylesheets to have it render the way you would like.\r\n\r\nUsing a css reset sheet like the one we use on livingstoneonline.org (https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/3.0.3/normalize.css) is recommend since its goal is to ensure the default styles on elements cause them to be rendered roughly equivalent regardless of what browser the user is using.\r\n\r\nOn a side note the \"Unyanyembe Journal\" will likely never look \"correct\" either embedded in the site or as a stand alone HTML file. Setting widths and margins on elements like that explicitly runs counter to how HTML and CSS is meant to work. Inline content like text is meant to flow relative to the amount of space and the users choice in fonts (families, size, and zoom level). And given that no width information is really built into the TEI the XSLTs will never know exactly how much space something needs to be placed to match the layout in the original document, so something will always be spaced too far out or too close as rules for each element applied can't know the required details."

I don't think that having the numbered pages at the bottom works well, so we need another, more obvious way to divide up the content so only chunks of it are shown at one time.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest divisions by date. Would the following be feasible:\r\n\r\nBefore 1840\r\n1840-1849\r\n1850-1859\r\n1860-1869\r\nAfter 1870\r\n\r\nThese would then be offered as a series of radial button options below the search boxes. See screen shot. The numbered pages of additional would not appear below the map because we wouldn't ever have \"additional\" pages.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-11 at 18 38 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/29234564-d99b9dba-7ec5-11e7-8b0e-2a9ecee1d371.png)\r\n",

Previously it did not appear at the bottom of the overview, hence why we added it manually to every page. In any case, feel free to resolve this however, you think is easiest/best."

Note, however, that I wanted to separate out Spectral Manuscript Pages and Images partly as a way for me to keep track of the number of images. So although there are 202 spectral manuscript pages, this really represents 3000 odd images so combining the two sounds like I won't be getting all that info. So, in other words, for regular manuscripts, one page = one image, hence why I combined then, but for spectral manuscripts, one page could = 17 images, etc. However, I'll review once I can access this."

  "body": "An issue when generating derivatives for ingested objects occurred during the migration ran on Dec 12. There is nothing in the logs as to why they failed. I’ve generated the JP2’s now using the “same“ code. So my best guess is that it was a timeout issue (PHP has a max run time per process of 60 seconds). Seems like it would be prudent to add a an additional table to the import page to list all the objects missing derived JP2’s so we’ll be aware of it if it happens again, along with the ability to manually trigger the regeneration of any images listed there.",

See attached screen shots. This appears to be tied to the height of the iframe which seems to need to be turned off.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-01-24 at 20 26 53](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/22488204/57d13b7c-e7d6-11e6-82c2-2eaaa9e8bacb.png)\r\n![screen shot 2017-01-24 at 20 26 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/22488203/57d0b1ca-e7d6-11e6-8d6d-5dfd5e067a1a.png)",

For example: \r\n\r\nhttp://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/creating-1870-field-diary#link14\r\n\r\nHas the following HTML\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<p class=\"space2\">\r\n... essay (see Livingstone 1870a:[7]) so Livingstone clearly had the essay by that date.\r\n<a id=\"link14\" name=\"link14\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a ...>▲</a><strong> Annotation of one undertext.</strong> ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it scrolls to the end of that first paragraph rather than the start of the next one which I think is the intention.

Over the holidays, I used my Ubuntu 16.04 computer via Filezilla (where I have set the default file type to be Binary, as instructed) to upload a bunch of images to our server.\r\n2. I then tried to transfer them to the UMD site via the normal process. When I started (to make up a figure) we had 130 GB left, but I ran the update and it failed. Then we had 120 GB left. I ran it again, same result, now 110 GB left.\r\n3. Then I reuploaded everything from my PC and this time it worked, but now we dropped down to 100 GB. \r\n\r\nI haven't looked into (or raised with you) why it doesn't work from my Ubuntu computer because sorting that out isn't a priority, but the point is that I only uploaded some small amount of data but because it failed twice it ended up taking much more space then necessary. So I would think that that 20 GB could be recovered. There were probably some similar instances in the past, when we ran into sync failures before.\r\n\r\nSo that's the space I was hoping we could recover somehow."

However, I do have a follow up question.\n\nWhen I look at two images and zoom in, then when I switch one of the images it resets to both images zoomed out (default view). Would it be possible to have it work as follows: \n\n1) Zoom in on both images, \n2) Select new image in one pane, \n3) Current zoom remains and new image shows up zoomed into the right place.\n\nHope that makes sense. \n\nIn other words, for instance, I'd like to examine a small area on an image. I zoom in and then might want to look at that area in multiple images so would be switching between different images, so I wouldn't want to zoom in again each time.\n"

I could also upload the relevant HTML page right into our site if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis might be a bigger task and need to be part of our next contract, but if not I thought I'd note it here.",

This is because _stage_ is accessing the _production_ Fedora (which doesn't share the same authentication system across servers; each has it's own). In the case of the user **admin** whose password is reset on startup, users logged in as **admin** on stage will see this warning.

  "body": "This issue relates to the colored buttons on levels 2 and 3 that lead to the main sections of the site. The issue is that when you mouse over these buttons, they do not always seem to be hyperlinked and it is possible to mouseover the hyperlinked text with it remaining unclickable and the pointer remaining as an arrow rather than changing into a hand. \n\nThis eventually resolves itself if you keep moving the pointer up and down over the colored button, but if a user doesn't know to do that, then they may think that the link is broken.\n\nI'd also suggest that instead of having just the text be hyperlinked, we make it so that the whole colored button is hyperlinked & clickable.\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-15 at 16 16 35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/17680113/3ff6ac1e-6304-11e6-86ef-8b0b5cfaada5.png)\n",

It's just a bit more obvious as the text floats over main image when the height is off, where as before the links were under the footer.\n\nTo reproduce all the caches on the phone must be cleared out, this can be done by visiting Settings > Safari and choosing to clear the caches. \n\nA fix has been deployed to stage and prod, in which we detect when images are loaded and update the margin with the new height.\n"

On the website page itself, however, in keeping with the level of overview that is provided for the different aspects of the project, we need one paragraph to provide the high level description. It'd be great if you could put this together, since you're most conversant in the configuration. I think the paragraph would best appear in the \"Hosting and Backup Arrangements\" section, would be placed between the \"Development Access\" and \"Site Versions\" sections, and might be called \"Site setup.\" However, feel free to offer recommendations on what it might be called and where it might be placed.\n"

At the heart of the system we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for deployment of code and dependencies, and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for the storing / managing code and configuration. We have a number of [Github Repositories](https://github.com/livingstoneonline) where we share our code and configuration. These repositories fall into three categories:\n1. Docker Related (Builds Docker image(s) that are deployed to the server: prefixed with _docker-_).\n2. Code Related (Code used by the site, to implement functionality: prefixed with _livingstone_online__)\n3. Unrelated (Not related to site setup)\n\nDocker images are build automatically when changes are made to the repositories identified above. This is performed by the [Docker Hub service](hub.docker.com/r/livingstoneonline). After Docker images are built they are automatically deployed by the [auto-deploy](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/docker-auto-deploy) application running on the sites server.\n\nIf you interested you can read more [here](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline#livingstone-online) \n"

The title on level 3 pages is visible, but if you click a link that's anchored to a place lower down on the page, then scroll back up, the title is gone. \n\nYou of course got this close to working, it was fine, then I noticed the other day that the issue had returned. I went into the back end, fixed it exactly as you did (oddly the setting had changed since you set it up correctly), but this time changing the settings didn't work.\n\nThis doesn't have to work perfectly -- if, say, the title simply moves closer to the carousel that will be OK -- but the title can't be disappearing as now.\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-15 at 16 09 32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/17679952/695dab12-6303-11e6-881d-392050843a38.png)\n![screen shot 2016-08-15 at 16 09 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/17679951/69598ee2-6303-11e6-9d1f-7707893f62fd.png)\n",

It occurs to me that one thing that might improve portrait mobile viewing of text is to reducing the padding on both sides. \n![img_3246](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/15843462/eebc5da2-2c27-11e6-945c-cfee1cafc591.PNG) In this view, Item Details could certainly be give more space at left and right. It doesn't have to be in such a narrow column. Alternately, we could do what we've done with the transcriptions and make it wider than the window -- not too wide but certainly so that more text could go on each horizontal line.\n"

Please bring the \"Item Details\" and \"Transcriptions\" buttons closer together. Make the distance between these two buttons the same as between the + magnifying glass and rotate buttons. You can take the extra space and put it to the left of the dropdown page number\n2. In the search box, you should have the text \"Search the entire site\" in gray and the text box should be white (same as on Kathy's Amazon dev site.)\n3. A couple of bugs on Filezilla: Page numbers in the dropdown are too big. Arrows and page numbers currently don't work, so you can't switch from first page to anything else.\n4. I think it'd like to go with icons centered in iPhone portrait.\n5. iPhone 5 portrait is wonky. Please review.\n\nAlso, one question: \n1. I thought that for portrait in iPhone etc we were going to have Images/Item Details/Transcription each be full screen? Right now it's split half and half.\n"

Please make the restricted icon muted red (better) or gray. The bright red you've chosen stands out too much and overshadows the blue icons. Also, the tooltip on this should read \"Restricted\" only.\n\nFinally, when you add the download size, you might put just a touch of padding to the right of the camera icon so that the down-arrow and the file size group together in a way that indicates that they go together.\n"

  "body": "1. The items in the bottom popup can be spaced closer together. I suggest a distance that is about half of what it is now. \n2. Also, can we put a little padding above and below the thumbnails, so that they pop up a bit more into the image when you scroll over them?\n3. The page number on the bottom popup should not be bold.\n4. The background on the bottom popup is currently black. Can we make it white so it's more visible that it's there in the first place?\n",

See screen shot. Perhaps that this point, the search bar could be extend to the button?  Also, the distance of the downward pointing right arrows on the right side of the Year, From, and To dropdowns in not the same as on the other dropdowns and it becomes very obvious in the mobile view. Please put all of these downward arrows the same distance from the right side. Once you do those two things, then please feel free to close this ticket.\n"

    "body": "All looks good except please adjust further as follows:\n\n1) Text sizes\n**Main title**\nfont-size: 1.75 em\nmargin-bottom: it appears that the solution I proposed (10em) does not work. The point is that right now there is an extra amount of space between the title and the items below it. The space below the title should be the same as the space between the different lines of this section.\nAlso, let's put a horizontal line below the title that runs end to end (left to right) and is gray. See how we do it on any page of the site, for instance: http://livingstone.lib.umd.edu/about-site/livingstone-online-introduction\n\n3) **Section Title for Digital Edition**\nfont-size: 1.75 em\nfont-weight: 600\nAlso, let's put a horizontal line below the title that runs end to end (left to right) and is gray. See how we do it on any page of the site, for instance: http://livingstone.lib.umd.edu/about-site/livingstone-online-introduction\nFinally, we need an empty line above this to set off this section from the previous one. Please make the empty line the size of a regular line in the section (rather than the size of the title).\n\nIn other words, I'd like to do the same thing for the Item Details and Digital Edition titles.\n"

    "body": "Sticking with FileBrowser on the site is no problem, and I agree with you that I'd rather not delete everything accidentally! \r\n\r\nHowever, in using FileBrowser this last week, I've come upon a few small issues which are an impediment:\r\n\r\n1. I can only upload one file at a time. \r\n2. There's no way to download files. To get files, I have to go through our server. In other words, to recreate on my computer what's in Drupal (which I was hoping to do as it would make things easier in the future to maintain everything), I would have to manually get the files from the server then recreate the File Browser directory structure on my computer.\r\n3. I don't see a way to move directories and/or files. Rather I have to delete and reupload. There's nothing like dragging from A to B.\r\n4. I've run into an issue with swapping out files for grid and carousel. I've done this through the section page form for the given page. In some cases, it overwrites the existing file. In other cases, it adds a zero or one to my existing file name and keeps the original file. It also does this when I just try to upload the file directly to File Browser so as to overwrite the original file. When I go to delete the original file via File Browser, it tells me that the file is still in use, but it can't be because both grid and carousel are showing my new file.\r\n\r\nNumbers 2 and 3, I can work around (and you can ignore them, unless you know an easy solution), but for numbers 1 and 4 it would be much better if they could be resolved. \r\n\r\nFor 4, see the screen shot below for an example of the issue. IMG_5192-carousel_0.jpg (which I just added) is being used in the site in grid and carousel. The zero was added because it didn't delete the original file (IMG_5192-carousel.jpg) when I uploaded the new one, although I expected it to. I tried to delete that original file *after* I uploaded my new file, but now I'm being told that the original file is still being used in the site. However, on the site I'm seeing my new file, so I'm not sure where the original file is being used.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-11-05 at 17 22 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/32420383-0aa4cc52-c24f-11e7-8bee-e13fd61ef5f0.png)\r\n"

Drupal assumes it has full control over the content and nothing else will make changes to it. There's not much to be done for this aside from going into the database and modifying it in each case which is a bit dangerous and error prone. I would recommend not changing or even looking at files in the folders managed by Drupal, just leave it be. Don't fuss over a number appended to the file, humans aren't really supposed to be looking at those file names.\r\n\r\n> Numbers 2 and 3, I can work around (and you can ignore them, unless you know an easy solution), but for numbers 1 and 4 it would be much better if they could be resolved.\r\n\r\n> For 4, see the screen shot below for an example of the issue.

Note that this doesn't move content around just the code. The content can only be moved around manually. It's best that you work from production when creating / changing section pages and just mark them as unpublished rather than working with any content on stage directly as changes to the content will get remove during deployments etc.\r\n\r\n> As you're merging, please note that I'm getting the following error on prod when I add new items to Fedora.\r\n\r\nThose are just notices and warnings, the update worked (the green section above) they aren't anything to worry about.\r\n\r\n> I suspect that this is related to the error in the previous comment, but this problem arose on a separate occasion.

A fix has been deployed, in the future if you do notice things are off on the browse by catalogue page you can run the \"Reindex Solr\" job and it should sort it, if not feel free to create a ticket.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"687\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-12-10 at 21 50 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/487373/33809783-370f341a-ddf4-11e7-8528-29f882d774f1.png\">\r\n"

Skip the rendering of facets on break point 2, and go right from 1 to 3 (probably the easiest solution).\r\n2. On break point 2, *also* extend creator and the three year dropdowns across one line (like break point 3), thereby leaving only four boxes at the two distributed over two rows: search/search catalouge/access/clear (slightly more work to implement this, but probably the better solution?)\r\nSo I'm going to remove the \"on hold\" label here.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 21 59 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/28992420-9a3eda8e-7960-11e7-9b88-1b4eb18a0feb.png)\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 21 59 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/28992421-9a3f1e90-7960-11e7-904e-4ee059371787.png)\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-04 at 21 59 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/28992419-9a3dcb94-7960-11e7-8d88-2368d37c4b82.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Into those sub-directions, put the images that go with each given page. If an image is used for two or more different pages, put separate copies of the image in each relevant sub-directory.\r\n\r\nSo, for instance, an image from a page in the In His Own Words section, would have the following path:\r\n\r\nIn-His-Own-Words/The-Livingstone-Online-Digital-Collection/liv_012043_0001-article.jpg\r\n\r\n3) In the case of critical edition page, add one more layer of sub-directories.\r\n\r\nSpectral-Imaging/Livingstone's-1870-Field-Diary/Project-Team/liv_000073_0002-article.jpg\r\n\r\n4) Finally, for images that are not linked to any given page, create one subdirectory at the top level (same level as the six main sections) and call that directory \"Unlinked.\" (On prod, you will now find some images that are unlinked to any given site page in just this way.)",

So, for instance, if you look at \"About this Site\" on the home page and compare it with a level 2 or 3 page, you will see that the text is the same size (that's good), but the colored button itself is wider on the home page. So whereas on level 2/3 if we say the width is 1, on home the width is 1.2 because of extra padding to the left and right of the word. Same for all the other buttons. Does that help?"

When the given button is depressed it turns grey, and only one or the other can be gray at one time (i.e., not both at the same time).\n2. Would it be possible to put these on a sticky header or simply keep them permanently at the top of the transcription window so that they were easily accessible however far down the user was in the transcription? If not, then I'd like to put an empty line between the bottom of these buttons and the top of the first line of the transcription text -- i.e., the buttons should not be right on top of the transcription text.\n"

It just appeared in the title tag of the browser (the error is likely somewhere else in the document and there may be multiple). \n\nLikely there are many more problems in the same vein that will show up only under particular circumstances. The problem arises from invalid HTML5 being generated from the transcription and inserted into the browser. \n\nThis isn't a small issue to fix, will likely take some time (could be in the range of day or more), in both the transform and the service (saxon) that provides the transformation.\n"

What I'd prefer is that the text didn't wrap and that when it was wider you got a slider at the bottom in order to scroll over. The slide would work and look (little black ball on a gray line) exactly the same as the vertical slide you already have. Currently, I can set the text to \"white-space: nowrap\" (do you want me to do that in the updated CSS?), but when I do that I don't get a horizontal slider. We would want a little padding on the right side so that there was a little white space between the edge of the visible text and the edge of the container.\n3. Looks good. Done.\n"

If so, could you put just a little padding to the left (a few pixels)?\n\nSetting the margin or padding on the left can be done on a parent element of the content, for example this can be handled in the style.css like so:\n\n``` css\n.TEI {\n    padding-left: 1em;\n}\n```\n\n> On the right, the longest text is also up against the edge of the window. Can you put a little padding on the right?\n\nTo get padding on the right you'll have to set it on the actual `p` tags, otherwise it's not like to have any affect. For example this can be handled in the style.css like so:\n\n``` css\n.p {\n   margin-right: 1em;\n}\n```\n\nSince these changes should be made to **style.css** I'll leave them to you, so we don't end up losing changes when you make other changes to **style.css**.\n"

Looks like I skipped over it thinking it was related to the first stated issue, or associated it with another ticket.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the first image was to have text wrap it was using `<dd>` elements which don't wrap by default, so pretty straight forward.\r\n\r\nThe second image is a bit tricky since it's part of the content and built with a single row table? Along with the `&nbsp;`'s it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to make this wrap accordingly without changing the actual content. \r\n\r\nLikely to make it work correctly we'll have to build a widget or set-out some rules on how to structure the HTML. Perhaps something like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/nbanks/pen/wepoYZ\r\n\r\nDoes this look reasonable to you?\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    "body": "The example you've provided looks good to me and I'd be happy to go with it. I see two issues, however. \r\n\r\nFirst, it seems to me that it would take a lot of coding to implement this manually, unless there's an automated way to do it. In case it helps, such TOC text, if present (it isn't always unless the given page has multiple sections), always precedes the first `<hr/>` on the page. \r\n\r\nSecond, TOC text, I believe, can take one of three forms: a) unordered lists (http://livingstoneonline.org/about-site/design-livingstone-online), b) ordered lists (http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/creating-1870-field-diary), and c) unordered lists that are actually partly ordered (http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/glossary-key-terms-livingstones-manuscripts-1870-71). I'd be OK with converting category #c into category #b. \r\n\r\nHowever, I wonder if another option here is to set up some kind of formula for mobile that, for any given page, ignores all instances of `&nbsp;` before the first `<hr/>`, puts all text flush left, and, as needed, simply wraps it to the next line. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense/seem feasible/is a simpler solution?"

I've gone into the back end, tried out the \"Templates\" button (Table of Contents option -- the only one), then tried to use one of the options from the Styles dropdown, but I don't quite get how this is to work. In particular, when I use the \"Templates\" button is erases what I've written and just produces a generic list.\r\n\r\nThe mobile issue is indeed resolved. \r\n\r\nSo, in other words, all that's left on this ticket is explaining tables to me.\r\n"

    "body": "No problem. We definitely don't want to break anything unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that until now I hadn't noticed the alignment between the nav tabs and the grid on stage, only that the nav tabs at lower resolutions appeared too wide (and, as noted, were uneven on desktop). I was going to point this out when we got to desktop/iPad review. When we got to that review, I was also going to note that we were planning to take out the white space between the tiles in the grid and, separately, between the nav tabs so that potentially complicates things.\r\n\r\nSo, I think the best thing is for me to look into this further and be back in touch. In the meantime, could you make the bottom of the logo flush with the bottom of the nav tabs? See screen shot. I think that would improve things considerably. Also, see the note I've made about the space to take out that I was previously referencing -- it looks like this was a difference space from what you thought. If my indicated space is reduced, it creates more space for the logo size to increase.\r\n![screen shot 2017-06-27 at 16 33 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12518623/27611129-9c965172-5b56-11e7-9c5f-dfdf0595a3a0.png)\r\n"

The biggest surprise for me in seeing all the locations mapped is actually how few geocoordinates we use. I thought we had a wider array, but I just checked the original MODS records and see that indeed for 3000+ items we only have 146 locations. \r\n\r\nThe location page is a bit slow loading, but I presume it will be faster on prod?\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this, I notice one small theming issue. When you click on a pin and the box pops, up, I see that the text in the Creator and Date fields is gray. Could we have the words \"Creator(s):\" and \"Date(s):\" remain gray, but have the text that follows be black?\r\n\r\nOther than that, this ticket is ready to be closed."

There are also tooltips in the XSLT display and these work fine on desktop but also don't work on mobile. Example page:\r\n\r\nhttp://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search/%221870%20Field%20Diary%22?f%5B%5D=genre_ms%3A%22spectral+color%22&view_pid=liv%3A000202&view_page=0\r\n\r\nSo the issue is slightly different, but still related to tooltips."

As I explained, sometimes when I open an image and try to move it around it \"skips\" i.e., kind of disappears off the screen and I return momentarily to the catalogue. Also, when I last use the view to look at images, select both a second page of an item or a transcription, returned an unfunctioning black screen.\r\n\r\nSince this seems to be related to the issue I cited above, I'm putting the text here and closing #119.\r\n"

In looking at the generated HTML there is no identifiers generated for dates. I can't seem to find them in the XSLT's either.

As you can see, some dates will be unknown, so I could spew out something in those cases as well, for instance, \"unknown\"\n\nRe: select text, sounds good for the other two; leave title as is.\n\nRe: top scroll, let's see how the panes look once you've reduced the height and we may not need that.\n"

What is the expected behvaior when we have multiple dates that are the exact same or for multiple Unknowns?\n\nShow each as a separate line to click, sequentially as they appear in transcript, so, for instance, if we have 1871-10-10 twice, then it should appear like this in the dropdown:\n\n10 Oct. 1871\n10 Oct. 1871\n\nIdeally, if you could do something like the following, that'd be even better:\n\n10 Oct. 1871 (1)\n10 Oct. 1871 (2)\n\nAlso, note that in the drop down, I think it would be better if all dates appears in alphanumeric sequence (with unknown at the end) even if the dates are out of sequence in the transcript in some cases.\n\n> When there is a date range like \"1871-10-12 1871-10-17\" I assume you want it to display like: \"12 Oct. 1871 - 17 Oct. 1871\"?\n\nYes, except no space on either side the dash \"12 Oct. 1871-17 Oct. 1871\", that's good. However, if it turns out that this makes the drop down too long (and so interferes with mobile), then we could just show the two endpoints as separate entities:\n\n12 Oct. 1871\n17 Oct. 1871\n"

    "body": "I think most everything you did looks great, so thank you for that. \n\nHowever, there are some additional adjustments I'd like:\n1. There's something off with the date dropdown as the dates that show up in the dropdown are one behind what's actually in the transcription. So, for instance, the text has \"1827\" but the dropdown shows \"1826\"; the text has \"17 Aug 1870\" but the dropdown shows \"16 August 1870\".\n2. Please modify how the dates are shown in the date drop down as follows:\n   a. No period after month name, so 1 Mar 1870\n   b. Use \"Sept\" rather than \"Sep\".\n   c. June and July can be written out in full.\n   d. Restore the space around a dash when there are multiple dates \"16 Mar 1871 - 17 Mar 1871\"\n3. Please select the 1870 Field Diary text, then scroll down in the dates until you find \"NaN BCE\". This is a bug. The text says \"-600\" in the data-date so this should come up as 600 BC and be the first item in the dropdown.\n4. When someone selects a date and the text scrolls to that date, could we have it show up highlighted in light gray or something like that?\n5. Could you increase the height of the panes very slightly?\n6. See attached screen shot for a few additional adjustments.\n\n![screen shot 2016-11-04 at 19 00 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/20026003/f4fd04b6-a2c2-11e6-977d-ef7bcfe97344.png)\n"

Hmm seems like it might be due to the Date parser provided by javascript, it may be interpreting the dates as as UT hence why I wouldn't see the date difference. Is it possible you could generate the date values like so:\n\n`YYYY/MM/DD` rather than `YYYY-MM-DD`\n\nAccording to the standard that would then be interpreted in local time (to the viewer), rather than based on Universal Time.\n"

Should it use the identifier for the document or page?

I I tried resetting as you suggest,  that but it didn't work for the view. See screen shot.\n![screen shot 2016-11-13 at 14 23 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/20246361/493b3d36-a9ad-11e6-8b19-f8c4025fbcd0.png)\n\n>  set to the same size and color as the Multi-XSLT viewer (0.9em and #333)\n\nEverything looks good except two things: 1) I'm not sure the text in the search bar is the right size or, at least, has the right spacing between characters. The font size in the spectral image dropdown is still too big.\n\n> If I make it larger then it won't be the same width. I'm not sure what your asking for?\n\nWell, once you reduce the font on the spectral image dropdown it may narrow a bit. Let's do that first. In the image you posted, the dropdown and popup appear to be the same width which is what I'd like to have.\n\nThis appears to be working in that changing the image will cause the transcription to move, but I think the confusion is from changing from one image to the next, which is not necessarily the same as change to the next page.\n\n> In some objects an image will be represented by multiple pages so by switching images we can jump over a number of pages. I can change this so that it jumps by a page at a time (rather than by an image at a time), but this will result in times when the user clicks on next in the image but nothing visibly happens in the image panel. If they are only looking at the image which would be confusing I think.\n\nIn terms of this comment, what I meant is that I was changing pages, not spectral images. So open it where an image is at left, then a transcription is at right. Inside the image box, click on the right or left arrow. The image changes to a new page, but the transcription stays in the same place whereas it should go to the new page.\n\n> 5) As I go to mobile, there is a point where the buttons go to two lines. This should not happen. See screen shot:\n> \n> Should be sorted now.\n\nThere's still some odd ghost text that appears. See screen shot.\n\n![screen shot 2016-11-13 at 14 33 35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/20246428/6ac8e182-a9ae-11e6-8dbf-e8fb6787e5d8.png)\n"

    "body": "> Level 2 pages are OK now. I I tried resetting as you suggest, that but it didn't work for the view. See screen shot.\n\nYou'll have to reset it on this page as well, as the browse remembers the zoom settings on a page by page basis.\n\n> Everything looks good except two things: 1) I'm not sure the text in the search bar is the right size or, at least, has the right spacing between characters.\n\nI've changed it back.\n\n> The font size in the spectral image dropdown is still too big.\n\nIt's the same size as the Multi-XSLT page which you requested for all the text/icons? Are you certain you wish for me to decrease the size, and if that's the case do mean to do so for all icons everywhere or just this single instance?\n\n> Well, once you reduce the font on the spectral image dropdown it may narrow a bit. Let's do that first. In the image you posted, the dropdown and popup appear to be the same width which is what I'd like to have.\n\nFirst we must decided if we want different sizes or the same for buttons and select fields?\n\n> In terms of this comment, what I meant is that I was changing pages, not spectral images. So open it where an image is at left, then a transcription is at right. Inside the image box, click on the right or left arrow. The image changes to a new page, but the transcription stays in the same place whereas it should go to the new page.\n\nIf it's not changing at all? I can't seem to reproduce this behavior then on firefox or chrome. Can you send me the identifier of the manuscript you're looking at and the pages your moving between? It might be something with the individual manuscript.\n\n> There's still some odd ghost text that appears. See screen shot.\n\nShould be sorted.\n"

In-text <hr/>s need to be made darker. This is true regardless of whether we make other changes, as I believe we might occasionally use <hr>s elsewhere in the site.\r\n2. The overview section as a rule should not have a gray line below. That's how it was set up before, so to compensate we always started the main text with an <hr>.\r\n\r\nI think this is all that is needed to get around the issue of moving all the TOCs (of which there are many).

  "body": "When a page is in a critical edition, but does not have a level two tile it loses the carousel (at the top of the page) and the share icons, etc. at the bottom of the page. For instance, take a look at this page: http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/diary-across-hands-space-and-time-2\r\n\r\nThis is not correct. Each page in the critical edition should be governed by the main critical edition page and should have the same colored carousel plus the share icons at bottom. So in other words a critical edition child page will differ from the critical edition parent page only in that the child does not have the arrows at the sides, but otherwise the page should look exactly the same.",

The link (which doesn't appear on the home page) also has the 'title' Home, currently.\r\n\r\n> 5. The little circles that allow users to select an image on the home page should probably also have alt text: Home Page Image 1, Home Page Image 2, etc.\r\n\r\nThey are not images so have no 'alt' attribute, but I've added a 'title' attribute to that affect.\r\n\r\n> 6. The institutional logos on the home page should also have alt text.\r\n\r\nK.\r\n\r\n> 7. The images on the carousel should have alt text. The alt text can be \"Image:\" plus the name of the page to which the image corresponds: \"Image: Project Team\"\r\n\r\nProbably don't need the image in-front of it as it's implied by the 'alt' attribute.

However, before I do something like that, here are two questions:\n\nFor dates, could we do something like 1) automatic sorting where if the MODS field that gives the text version of the date says \"Date Unknown\", those items are automatically sorted _last_ in the relevant table column, and then behind the scenes sorting by the beginning date in the ISO date ranges happens as a second priorty? and then separately 2) these items would appear under \"Date unknown\" in the date facet rather than under a specific year?\n"

We can force a record to appear lower or higher by giving it a date, that's either earlier or later relative to all the others. \n\nThe only work around for this would be to choose some date that's way off in the future say 9999-01-01 or whatever the limit would be, and forcing \"Unknown Dates\" to have that as their date value, in total I think there are currently 57 records which have \"Unknown Dates\", some of them have small date ranges like 1838/1873, so information would be lost. \n\nThat being said we can't really have both, so it's either objects show up in a single date (which we can label \"Unknown Date\", or they can exist in a range, say 1838 to 1873.\n"

There were 50 odd records with \"Date unknown\" in the MODS, so for the ISO field of those records I, first, changed all unknown Livingstone items to the single date of 1873, so they would display after all his items for which dates are known and, second, for all other Livingstone-related items I made an educated guess in terms of a single date. Please resync the MODS records from Github, and you'll get the newest files.\n\nThere are still Livingstone items that have a definitive date range, for instance a journal that we know he wrote between 1866 and 1872, so those date ranges I've left (in all cases, those ranges will only be a few years). For those items, I would be happy in showing them for _each relevant year_, so the example journal could show up under 1866, 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872. And so forth.\n"

Confirming that: border looks good (p.1); fully-clickable space looks good (p.4); text wrapping (p.6) looks good. \r\n\r\nLinks in dropdown (p.5) also looks good, although note that you've not brought down some of the specific configurations for links from prod -- some links are configured to open in a new window (on prod), but that formatting has been lost on stage. See, for instance, \"Images & Transcriptions of the 1870 Field Diary\" in the 1870 FD dropdown. I just changed this to target=\"_blank\" to match prod, but it wasn't carried over automatically. In any case, this is minor and I can easily reimplement when the time comes, but just wanted to make you aware of this issue.\r\n\r\nRe p.2, yes using same symbol as on Browse Collection and, yes, it'd be great to have it point right when closed and point down when open. Could we also have the right/down function apply to Browse Collection? Finally, yes, to be consistent we should have on the mobile dropdown menu also.\r\n\r\nRe p.3, for now let's just try it on the desktop menu. For mobile stick with black for now please."

See, for instance, \"Images & Transcriptions of the 1870 Field Diary\" in the 1870 FD dropdown. I just changed this to target=\"_blank\" to match prod, but it wasn't carried over automatically. In any case, this is minor and I can easily reimplement when the time comes, but just wanted to make you aware of this issue.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be done manually, and will be on hold until after the migration.

Currently we're doing this based on resolution of the screen, but that leads to odd edge cases in which the user might be using a large iPad (which has a screen resolution higher than some laptops), currently in this case the text on the grid page is not visible to them. \r\n\r\nAlso it occurred to me that the users can't see the categories of pages until they individually mouse over each one, which doesn't seem that user friendly as it obstructs useful information for navigating the site. \r\n\r\nI suggest we drop the hover functionality and display text at all times, what do you think?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1007\" alt=\"hover\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/487373/25948286/b3cf8452-364a-11e7-936f-4b7ab3ebff19.png\">\r\n",

Only about 6% of our users use tablet and only some percentage of those would be edge cases, maybe 1% or so.

The views that power the grid and carousel only display published content, this can be changed though.\r\n\r\nI've added the node, and changed the views to show unpublished content as well (users who are not logged in will still not see them though, they must login to see them).\r\n\r\nAlso on a side note the image used for the carousel is way to huge: http://livingstoneonline.org/sites/default/files/liv_000010_0140-article2.jpg something like 65x65 would look much better."

    "body": "Unfortunately, this is still problematic for the following reasons:\n1. I was looking for all the lines of text to be centered on the area below the dropdown, but the latter two lines seem left justified (PDF transcriptions (general users) / TEI transcriptions MODS Records). All lines should be continuously centered.\n2. \"PDF transcriptions (general users)\" is one bit of text but it looks like you've put extra spacing between \"PDF transcriptions\" and \"general users\" as if these were two items.\n3. Lines are still breaking in two at some resolutions. See attached screen shots. \n   ![screen shot 2016-07-11 at 22 13 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/16745169/eb958542-47b4-11e6-83ec-97a68120b75a.png) \n   ![screen shot 2016-07-11 at 22 15 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12518623/16745225/2e969cbe-47b5-11e6-9d80-9641010f7cbc.png)\n\nFinally, note that on stage, this page has padding at the sides added by Kathy in preparation for adding arrows at the sides. So search boxes look a little wonky at narrower resolutions because of the extra padding. However, once Kathy adds and configures the arrows, full width should be restored at narrow resolutions because the arrows disappear by the time you get to iPad width and the catalogue then goes full width again. I hope that make sense.\n"

As I think people reading the site will be more interested in viewing the content of a single row rather than comparing values between two or more rows. Adopting this method would also save us the hastle of rebuilding the table to work with extjs.\n"

See the attached mockup. Specifically, I've:\n1. Put the main menu farther to the left.\n2. Replaced the home icon with our standard home icon.\n3. Replaced the other icons with our standard icons (and added Pintrest) plus spaced out all icons evenly.\n4. Placed the magnifying glasses evenly on either side of the slider.\n5. Place the rotate icon closer to the magnifier.\n6. Move the page number next in line and increased the size of it slightly to match the size of \"Transcription\" and \"Item Details\"\n7. Better spaced out the \"Transcription\" and \"Item Details\" buttons.\n8. Elongated the search bar to match the other pages of the site.\n9. Put the X further right.\n10. Grouped the various items on the top strip and better distributed them horizontally.\n",

    "body": "This is definitely close. Here are my suggestions for Desktop:\n1. Move menu at left (and the other icons) slightly over to the left. In short, the menu should be closer to the edge, and the menu on left should be same distance from left edge as X box is from right edge.\n2. Spacing between icons at left does not appear even. In particular, the home icon needs a little more space around it, the facebook icon a little less.\n3. The left magnifying glass is much closer to the slider than the right. I like the distance of the right, so use that on both side.\n4. The distance of the right magnifying glass to the slider should be the same as from the magnifying glass to the rotate button.\n5. Lower the page number button so that the bottom of it is even with the bottoms of the \"Item details\" & \"Transcription\" buttons. Also the page number is right now too big. The size of the font should be the same size as that of \"Item Details\" and \"Transcription\"\n6. The Item Details and Transcription buttons could each be a bit wider (particularly Item details). Right now the text looks squashed in there. \n7. Item Details and Transcription buttons are too close together. Move the transcription button over to the right.\n8. Move the search bar farther over to the right.\n9. The X button should be the same height and at the same level (vertically) as the search bar, Item Details and Transcription buttons etc.\n\nLet's see how these changes look. After this, we may need to have quick Skype session to finalize and/or to discuss break points for mobile.\n\nBtw, for some odd reason, it's not letting me switch pages either via the dropdown or the arrows. Perhaps this is a temporary bug?\n"
