This is now the second instance I&#x27;ve found of this link being incorrect. See screen shot. In short, all instance of http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary-0 need to be changed to http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-1871-field-diary (i.e., without the final zero).

I also see some instances of http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre-0 but these are being correctly redirected to http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/livingstones-letter-bambarre

Should be sorted now.

OK, thank you. Once this is on prod, if I see any other instances, I can fix these myself.
