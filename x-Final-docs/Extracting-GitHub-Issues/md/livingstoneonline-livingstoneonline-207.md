I went to access this page today: http://livingstoneonline.org/his-own-words/multiple-versions-text

And got the following error. See screen shot. I&#x27;ve seen this before, but it only happens occasionally. For instance, when I accessed the page just now it was fine.

I&#x27;ve added a caching layer that should hopefully cut down on the timeouts occuring.

Ok, sounds good. Thanks very much. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on this and let you know if it comes up again.
