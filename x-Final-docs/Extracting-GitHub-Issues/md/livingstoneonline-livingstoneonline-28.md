# [MS Viewer: Zoom and Move Speed](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/28)

Please slow down the speed at which the viewer zooms in and at which items move around the screen. If you provide me with the current values, I can give you preferred values.

The values aren&#x27;t really corresponding to anything in particular (it&#x27;s not a 1-100 sort of thing). But I&#x27;ve slowed them down quite a bit and we can always do a call after to adjust it.

OK, sounds good.

Let&#x27;s adjust speed on a call later this week. I think what may be bothering me is less the speed than the fact that the image &quot;swims&quot; -- that it keeps moving after you push the button or stop dragging it. Is there a way to turn this swimming off?

Fixed weird dragging behaviour. Currently much smoother, it will however snap back to the approximate centre if you drag it toward the edges, this is a feature to prevent &quot;losing&quot; the image outside of the bounds of the viewer.

Let&#x27;s discuss this in a call this week, the same one in which we discuss #24.
