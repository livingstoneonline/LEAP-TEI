1. For the logo, the increase looks good, but could you now decrease the width by a hair&#x27;s breadth. Sorry to be such a nitpicker about this.
2. For some reason, when I mouseover the nav tab of the section in which I am, it disappears. So for instance, if I&#x27;m in About this Site, then this happens to the About this site nav tab only. I&#x27;m not sure we need this to be happening.
