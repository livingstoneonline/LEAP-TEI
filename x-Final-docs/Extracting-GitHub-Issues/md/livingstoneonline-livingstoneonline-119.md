I&#x27;ve run into issue with the image viewer when looking at it on my iPhone. As I explained, sometimes when I open an image and try to move it around it &quot;skips&quot; i.e., kind of disappears off the screen and I return momentarily to the catalogue. Also, when I last use the view to look at images, select both a second page of an item or a transcription, returned an unfunctioning black screen.

I&#x27;ve combined this with #107. See my comment there.
