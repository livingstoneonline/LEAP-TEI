# [Geolocation: Page specs](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/201)

The URL for the page should be &quot;in-his-own-words/geolocation&quot; and the Browse button dropdown should say &quot;geolocation&quot; also. Other things like the page title etc need to be fixed, but I can do that down the road.

I&#x27;m going to put this on hold, as I&#x27;m a bit divided on whether we should use location or geolocation.

I&#x27;d like to stick with location, so I&#x27;m going to close this ticket.
