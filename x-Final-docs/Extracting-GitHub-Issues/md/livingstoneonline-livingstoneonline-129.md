liv_000093 and liv_000094 should be private and are set up thus on our server, but both are accessible from the viewer. Any idea what&#x27;s going on here? Are there other files like this?

They don&#x27;t appear to be accessible?

You&#x27;re right. I just realized I probably looked at these while logged in. I&#x27;d forgotten that while logged in, the inaccessible is accessible.
