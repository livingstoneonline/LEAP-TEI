# [Spectral image viewer: adjustments](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/95)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2016-11-2**

See attached for adjustments, but in short here is the list:

1. Remove all caps in spectral image dropdowns.
2. Have the image dropdown say &quot;Select spectral image type&quot; by default
3. Please put a thin white line down the middle to separate the two panes.
4. Put spectral images in the order given. &quot;spectral_ratio&quot; should be the default on the right.
5. Put the lightning flash (in black) after the word &quot;Compare&quot; in that button for a little clarity as to what the button does.

&gt; Have the image dropdown say &quot;Select spectral image type&quot; by default

Are you sure you wish to have that dropdown say that? As a selection is presented automatically and it&#x27;s not possible to show a non-selection?

The concern is that user are not going to know what they spectral image name is/means. What about some text that appears on hover, as we have already set up for when the transcription button is not clickable? We could do the same thing, working/looking the exact same way, and the hover would say &quot;Select a spectral image type&quot;

Added a tooltip, ready for review on stage.

Still some adjustments needed. See two attachments.

Even without the padding, and the new text the tooltip is larger than the select field.

What about just slightly widening the spectral image dropdown? That would also allow you to put a touch of left-right padding on the tooltip.

Doing so causes the button row to break to the next line.

What about reducing the size of the text in the tooltip one notch? Also, please de-capitalize the first &quot;S&quot; in the tooltip.
