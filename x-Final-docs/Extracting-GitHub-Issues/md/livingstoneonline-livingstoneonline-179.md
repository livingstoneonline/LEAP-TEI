# [Desktop: Catalogue download text](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/179)

The placement of the download text on the Catalogue page doesn&#x27;t look good on desktop being flush right. Can you put it to the left, after the Full record check box. In other words, this should just look more like a line of regular text. Also, the download text seems to be smaller than the Full record text. Please make everything the size of the Full record text.

This still needs some work as it doesn&#x27;t quite look right. Can you please do the following:

Put a little more space to the left of download.

Change the download text so that it reads as follows:

Download: PDF transcriptions, TEI transcriptions, MODS Records

In other words, let&#x27;s make this look more like regular text. I&#x27;ve removed the stuff in the parenthesis, I&#x27;ve reworded slightly, I&#x27;ve put in commas (these would be black) between the download terms (these would be hyperlinked blue).

My apologies for this, but two more changes please:

1. Reduce the padding to the left of &quot;Download&quot; to 25px.
2. Replace the two &quot;,&quot; in the text with &quot; -&quot;. In other words, separate with an n-dash rather than a comma; the n-dash has a space both on the left and right of it.
