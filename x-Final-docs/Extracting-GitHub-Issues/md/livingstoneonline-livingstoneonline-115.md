# [Long paths in topmenu](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/115)

Just a reminder that we need to look at the issue with long paths in the topmenu for which I had to turn to bit.ly as a temporary solution. Either of the images &amp; texts options in the dropdown for the 1870 Field Diary is an example of this.

No longer using topmenu but there is now no limit on the length of a url in a menu link.

OK, we can discuss on Thursday. Also, on the back end, I can&#x27;t see where to access importing content from remote FTP and updating modules via the Livingstone development settings so you&#x27;ll have to show me that as well. Leave this ticket open for now as a reminder.

All sorted on this one. Thank you.
