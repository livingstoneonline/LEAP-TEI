&gt; In terms of downloading the packets, the sizes range from two that are just over a GB, a handful between 100 and 700 MB, and the rest below 100 MB, so I wonder if next to the download icon we couldn&#x27;t put/auto-generate the file size in parenthesis just so people know what they&#x27;re getting into before they download. Could you do that? So in the access column it would look like this 
&gt; [eye icon] [download icon] (135 MB)

Should take &lt; 1hr.

Since the icons are sort of related to this issue, I&#x27;ll just put this here, but feel free to move it to a new issue if you prefer:
1. Please replace the eye icon with the camera icon: http://fontawesome.io/icon/camera/
2. Please replace the download icon with the arrow-down icon: http://fontawesome.io/icon/arrow-down/
3. Please make the restricted icon muted red (better) or gray. The bright red you&#x27;ve chosen stands out too much and overshadows the blue icons. Also, the tooltip on this should read &quot;Restricted&quot; only.

Finally, when you add the download size, you might put just a touch of padding to the right of the camera icon so that the down-arrow and the file size group together in a way that indicates that they go together.

Set colour of text to #808080, font-size 0.8 em, and vertically center.

Looks good. You may push to prod when ready!
