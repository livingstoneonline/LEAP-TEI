# [Manuscript Viewer: Ordered List of Spectral Images](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/84)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2016-9-10**

I&#x27;m creating this ticket so you have an easy reference for the order of images in the spectral image viewer. No single page will have all these renderings, so only those that are available for the given page should show up in the dropdown.

I forgot to tell you that we ended up shortening a lot of these names and that these new short names should be used in the viewer. I hope this will be OK to change the names. I attach a spreadsheet which shows you the short name for each of the images above. Also, please remember that the images should be shown (when present) in the order given above. The order is also in the spreadsheet for the new short names.

This is fine as long as the file names don&#x27;t change on the FTP server, as the file name is how we derive the identifier and determine what&#x27;s to be copied over.
