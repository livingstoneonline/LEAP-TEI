# [All levels: Search box dropdown](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/170)

It looks like you&#x27;ve added a dropdown to the main site search box, whereas before the dropdown simply appeared when a user clicked in the search box. Although the click dropdown is an elegant solution, it also means extra clicking and if a user is trying to search multiple time, in only part of the site, it can quickly get cumbersome. Please restore this dropdown to how it is on prod.
