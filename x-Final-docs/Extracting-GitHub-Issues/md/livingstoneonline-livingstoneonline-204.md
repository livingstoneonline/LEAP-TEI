# [Manuscript Viewer: 2bugs](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/204)

I found two issues with the MS viewer:

1. Desktop: http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/in-his-own-words/catalogue?f%5B%5D&#x3D;dateRangeYear_mi%3A%221872%22&amp;view_pid&#x3D;liv%3A000049&amp;view_page&#x3D;0

See screen shot. The blue issue is here (though I assume that will be resolved per previous discussion), but also note how the display is working: Item details is crammed over to the left and there&#x27;s the extra white gap in the middle.

2. Mobile: When one advances to a given page of a transcription, the page number should appear at the top below the header, but you&#x27;ll note that in the attached image the page number actually goes under the header. This is how it rendered when I selected image/page 2.

These issues have been addressed in previous tickets.

Indeed, they have. However, in reviewing the second one, I found a new bug. See screen shot. The background color of the transcription changes halfway across the screen.
