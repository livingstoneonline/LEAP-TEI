# [Dropdown on non-edition pages](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/97)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2016-11-6**

Just a reminder, the dropdown needs to be configured so that it does not appear on pages that are not in an edition, but to which the edition is pointing. For example:

http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/notes-processed-spectral-images

That page is in the &quot;Spectral Imaging&quot; section (rather than being a child of the critical edition) so should not have a dropdown at top, although the critical edition dropdown does point to it.

K this should be sorted now, but it&#x27;s important to note that the page must exists somewhere else in the top menu for this to take affect for  example it&#x27;s still showing on [edition guide](http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/edition-guide) but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not yet been placed elsewhere in the [topmenu](http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/admin/structure/menu/manage/menu-topmenu).

OK, this looks sorted. Thank you! Closing this ticket.
