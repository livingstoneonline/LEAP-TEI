# [Multitext Viewer: Space between panes](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/189)

Please put about 14px padding between the panes. Right now there is no space between them at all. In other words, this padding should be added to the right of the scroll bar in the center of the page.
