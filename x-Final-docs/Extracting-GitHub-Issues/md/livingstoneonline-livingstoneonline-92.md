Still some adjustments needed. See attached.

Hmm I can&#x27;t seem to reproduce the scroll bar on firefox chrome or safari?

I&#x27;m using Firefox 49.0. The gray border both at bottom and at right is for the scroll bar. If on a given page the scroll bar is needed (as in my screen shot above), then it appears inside of that gray bar, so clearly that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for; at the bottom it&#x27;s obviously for side to side scrolling. That said, given that it&#x27;s light gray, it&#x27;s fairly low key and innocuous so if you can&#x27;t figure out how to turn it off when not needed, then we can just leave it.

Ready to review on stage (still couldn&#x27;t get the scroll bar issue to occur).

This also looks fantastic. Just a few additional tweaks:

1) Put some padding above the title (1.5em). Right now the title is too close to the top.
2) As this narrows, please watch that the X box in the upper right-hand corner does not go over the text (see screen shot below).

3) At the most narrow width, the download files should not break over two lines (see screen shot). There&#x27;s enough room for them to stay on one line.

K, changed from 1em to 1.5em.

&gt; 2) As this narrows, please watch that the X box in the upper right-hand corner does not go over the text (see screen shot below).

With the additional top padding it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen anymore.

&gt; 3)  At the most narrow width, the download files should not break over two lines (see screen shot). There&#x27;s enough room for them to stay on one line.

Should be sorted now.

&gt; K, changed from 1em to 1.5em.

Actually I meant add 1.5em to what was there already. Looking at this now, however, you could make it 3em total from the top, rather than 1.5em total from the top as now.

&gt; With the additional top padding it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen anymore.

Unfortunately, still happening. See attached this is an issue on longer title. Moving it farther down, as I just asked, may help.

Indeed, the line breaking is no longer happening

OK, that is fixed, but on reviewing I still see two issues. See screenshot.

This one&#x27;s a wrap. Thank you for your work on this!
