# [Question re: Level 2 Grid and Level 3 Carousel Images](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/229)

I see that Level 2 Grid and Level 3 Carousel Images can be reviewed via the &quot;Files&quot; option from the Content menu. 

I also see that these images appear in the list of items in the root menu of File Browser, but I don&#x27;t not see them in the page subdirectories where I would expect to see them. So, for instance, the subdirectory in File Browser for the &quot;Livingstone Online: An Introduction&quot; page (http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-this-site/livingstone-online-introduction) has the two images used to illustrate that page, but does not have the tile or carousel images for this page.

Can you clarify the workflow for how I should edit, delete, add, etc. these grid and carousel images going forward?

These images should not be edited directly if you wish to change these images just upload / select a image a new image on the edit page for that particular section page.

Unlike the files in &quot;Livingstone Online: An Introduction&quot; folder and so on, these files are actually managed by Drupal.
