Partially done, not 100% but is functional.

OK, thank you for this update. So should I be looking at anything (and if so, what?) or should I wait on you to bring this closer to the end?

Wait for now, at the moment it&#x27;s functional in that nothing is hidden and it resizes appropriately, but the margins between icon isn&#x27;t ready yet; this also ties into issues/24.

Pretty solid now for responsive resolutions, I paid special attention to iPad in landscape mode, so the bar fits on the entire line. With large screens it should look good as well.

As noted in #24, we&#x27;ll come back to review this after sorting out #24.
