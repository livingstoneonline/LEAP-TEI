# [Catalogue: width of access column](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/128)

This may be taken care of with the work you&#x27;re already planning with the catalogue, but if not here&#x27;s a ticket for it. The access column changes width (i.e., gets more narrow) when users click the full view box. I would like the width to stay fixed as it is when the box is not clicked.
