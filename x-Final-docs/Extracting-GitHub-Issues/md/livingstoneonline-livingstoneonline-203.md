Right now there are two options: Map and Satellite and one checkbox for each of them. What are the possibilities for what we could have here?

Can we make the default display to be Satellite view (rather than Map) but with both &quot;labels&quot; for Satellite and &quot;terrain&quot; for Map checked. See screen shot for the desired view, although note that it shouldn&#x27;t be zoomed in like in the screen shot.

These are all the possibilities.

Done except there isn&#x27;t a &quot;labels&quot; for Map.
