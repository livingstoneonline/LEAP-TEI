# [Tooltips issue in MS Viewer](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/240)

I&#x27;ve also found a small issue with tooltips in the MS viewer (also in spectral image viewer). The tooltips appear easily on mouseover, but then are very peristent and it is hard to get them off the screen.

By contrast, tooltips work fine in the multitext viewer.
