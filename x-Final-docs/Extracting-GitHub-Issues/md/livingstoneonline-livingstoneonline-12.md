Please make the column widths on the new Catalogue the same as those on the existing catalogue on prod, etc.

This has been deployed to stage, but note that they will not be 100% the same, as a table is meant to be fluid (growing to the given size). But the min-width will be respected.

OK, what you&#x27;ve done looks good. However:

Please make the genre column somewhat wider by default.
Please make the title and date columns wider when the full table is shown.

We walked though the widths in a call today and I adjusted them and they are now deployed to stage, so I think we can close this one.
