# [Multitext Viewer: Stying of text in panes](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/188)

The text in the panes, although generally styled properly, is not being fully styled per the relevant CSS. For instance, compare this page on stage and prod: http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/spectral-imaging/three-versions-the-1870-field-diary and you&#x27;ll see that the main title is not being properly rendered on stage.

This is covered by ticket: https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/137 we can&#x27;t use recent changes to the XSLT until after the migration (during which we have to sort out the CSS issues of no longer rendering in an iframe).
