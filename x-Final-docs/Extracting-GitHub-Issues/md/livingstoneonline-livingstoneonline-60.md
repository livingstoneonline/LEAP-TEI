On the &quot;Item Details&quot; page, in the &quot;Digital Edition&quot; section, after the &quot;Date&quot; line, please put a new line that says:

Download item: [down-arrow] [size of item]

So, in other words, the last two things should look just like they do in the catalogue.

Looks good, except you put it after the Date in the &quot;Item Details&quot; section, but you&#x27;ll note above that I said it should go after the Date in the &quot;Digital Edition&quot; section.
