# [Spectral image viewer: transcriptions](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/96)

There is an issue with viewing spectral images in that if you choose a page other than the first one (for instance, page 2 or page 3 -- i.e., I&#x27;m not talking about choosing a different spectral image), then look at the transcription it doesn&#x27;t not automatically adjust to the page that you are on.

Thanks! This looks to be resolved except for the point I noted in the other ticket.
