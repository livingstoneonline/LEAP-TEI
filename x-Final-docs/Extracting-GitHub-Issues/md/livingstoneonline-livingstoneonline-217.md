# [Edition URLs](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/217)

Each of the editions in the site have some common pages, among them the following:

Edition Guide
1871 FD: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/edition-guide-1
1870 FD: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/edition-guide
Bambarre: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/edition-guide-0

Project Team
1871 FD: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/project-team-1
1870 FD: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/project-team
Bambarre: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/project-team-0

Acknowledgments
1871 FD: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/acknowledgments-1
1870 FD: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/acknowledgments
Bambarre: http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/acknowledgments-0

The URLs for these are similar, but of course not identical and point to different pages based on the given edition. I mention this because I see that some of the edition URLs throughout the editions on stage (and on the site guide page: http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-this-site/livingstone-online-site-guide) have gotten mixed up. Is there a way to compare against prod other than manually?

I&#x27;m going to have to go through them manually, the issue arised from random ordering when the alias were generated on the deployment to stage. I&#x27;m gonna change them to have explicit names like:

- http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/1870-acknowledgments
- http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/1871-acknowledgments
- http://livingstoneonline.org/spectral-imaging/bambarre-acknowledgments

Ok, let me know if I can help with this. 

There is also the following, in addition to the ones cited above:

Should be sorted now.

OK. Thank you. I can take it from here, once we go to prod, and change myself in case any instances are missed.
