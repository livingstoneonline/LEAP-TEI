The end of the table is full of pages of empty boxes:

http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search/*%3A*?type&#x3D;edismax&amp;page&#x3D;144

These should be removed.

I&#x27;m still seeing it:

http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search/*%3A*?type&#x3D;edismax&amp;page&#x3D;28

This doesn&#x27;t come up if I click on the link I cited in the first post in this thread. But if I start from that link, then go to, for example, page 26 of the records, then go to page 28 (the link I&#x27;m giving you here), you can see that the issue is still there.

You&#x27;ll note too that by following this process &quot;:&quot; is also again appearing in the search box.

Should be sorted now.

Yes, appears resolved. Thank you!
