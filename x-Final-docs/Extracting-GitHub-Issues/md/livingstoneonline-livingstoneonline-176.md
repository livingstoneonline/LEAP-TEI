Also, there is an odd white box to the right of the alphabet. See screen shot.

It might also be my imagination but it seems to me that the lines are bunched together on this page, suggesting that the line height needs to be increased to match other pages on the site.

Carousel added, odd white box removed, line height appears resolved. Thank you.
