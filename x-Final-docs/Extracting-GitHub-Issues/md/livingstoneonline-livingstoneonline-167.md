# [Tablet: Grid boxes](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/167)

See screen shot. At this size, the grid boxes are too large (about 460px width). I realize this is one of those tricky in-between sizes, but at this size please add some white space at the size so that the grid boxes are smaller. The issue are 1) that we never wanted the grid boxes this large and 2) the images are sized at 390px width, so are getting distorted at this size.
