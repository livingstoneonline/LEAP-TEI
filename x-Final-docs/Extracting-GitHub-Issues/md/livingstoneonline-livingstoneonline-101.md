# [Sticky header: Critical edition label](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/101)

Ideally, the sticky header would have the title of the specific page on which the user is, but if that&#x27;s took tricky then it should at least be the title of the main critical edition page, so in this case &quot;Livingstone&#x27;s 1870 Field Diary&quot;

Also note that since there&#x27;s no level 2 tile for this page (since it&#x27;s part of the critical edition), &quot;Spectral Imaging&quot; in the sticky header is not purple when it should be.
