# [Back end order for creating section pages](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/219)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2017-9-15**

Please rearrange the order of items on the &quot;Create Section Page&quot; page from the top down as follows:

Pre-Title
Title
Subtitle
Main Text
Byline
Critical edition
Overview
Teaser

[rest of the order is fine]

Also, note that the overview and teaser sections will rarely have a lot of text, so both can be cut to about 1/3 their current height.

For the author and editor sections, please add the following descriptive text: Please give the name in the last name, first name format: &quot;Wisnicki, Adrian S.&quot;

Finally, the &quot;date&quot; and &quot;outbound link&quot; sections can be removed as we don&#x27;t use them.

Done.

Unfortunately this is not an exposed setting I can tweak.

&gt; For the author and editor sections, please add the following descriptive text: Please give the name in the last name, first name format: &quot;Wisnicki, Adrian S.&quot;

Done.

Date has been removed but we do use &quot;outbound link&quot; on one section page, the one used to link to the digital catalogue and pass some parameters in via the url. The &quot;The Livingstone Spectral Image Collection&quot; node does this, so we can&#x27;t remove it.

OK, all looks good. Thank you. 

Can you let me know where this is edited so I can do it myself in the future if necessary.

You&#x27;ll need to be logged in as the admin user to change the ordering or the fields.
