            <p>See screen shot. The search boxes are bunched too close together vertically. Please put some space between them.

          <div class="body"><p>OK, but see screen shot. I don&#39;t think the search boxes need to be this wide at this resolution. Rather, we could have it so that two were in the first row (and the row still need not be so wide) and in the second row, we could have one on the left and and the search/reset boxes on the right. See mockup. Also, although I&#39;ve not done it in the mock up, the research/reset buttons could each be made wider so that together they were as wide as the search box above and the whole thing looked symmetrical.
