<p>Same way to update production just go to the deploy tab and choose stage rather than prod. Note that this doesn&#39;t move content around just the code. The content can only be moved around manually. It&#39;s best that you work from production when creating / changing section pages and just mark them as unpublished rather than working with any content on stage directly as changes to the content will get remove during deployments etc.</p>

<p>Those are just notices and warnings, the update worked (the green section above) they aren&#39;t anything to worry about.</p>

<p>In this case it was a new bug not related to the warnings above that arose from a configuration change. A fix has been deployed, in the future if you do notice things are off on the browse by catalogue page you can run the &quot;Reindex Solr&quot; job and it should sort it, if not feel free to create a ticket.</p>
