            <p>Given the change discussed in #199 and the focus of this page, I think the first search box should be &quot;Search by geolocation&quot; rather than date. The search box could search two fields in the MODS records, those with Livingstone&#39;s locations and those with the normalized LoC location names</p>

          <div class="body"><p>After further review of this with one of our collaborators, it&#39;s become clear that we&#39;d not like to have the row of search boxes on this page, so let&#39;s plan to remove it.</p>
<p>Ideally, it&#39;d be preferable to have a series of facets here. Would it be possible to have those on this kind of page rather than the search boxes? The facets would be drawn from the MODS.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be driven by facets as this display is driven by Drupal Views (MySQL) rather than the Digital Catalogue which is driven by Solr which has support for facets.</p>
<p>I have removed the various searches which allows us to use caching so I can now display all 3000+ records on the map at once with reasonable performance.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Oh that&#39;s great. I think this works well as is. I don&#39;t see all 3,000 records currently, but I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re just not on stage (I believe you said that before).</p>
<p>Once I add the &quot;overview&quot; text add the top, I can use that to explain how the page works, etc. </p>
<p>When you push to prod, please leave the Geolocation page as unpublished and then I&#39;ll finalize it before it goes live.</p>
<p>Feel free reopen the comment if there&#39;s anything else to add about this, but otherwise thank you again on this one.</p>
