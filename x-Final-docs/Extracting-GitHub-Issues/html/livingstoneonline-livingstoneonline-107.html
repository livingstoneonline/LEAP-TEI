            <p>This page (and others like it) have tooltips that Kathy created:</p>

<p>They work fine on desktop, but on mobile often popup partly off the screen with no way to move them into the screen.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Sounds good. Let me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to help. Also, I thought I noted this in another ticket, but now don&#39;t see it, but we did email about it. There are also tooltips in the XSLT display and these work fine on desktop but also don&#39;t work on mobile. Example page:</p>
<p><a href="http://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search/%221870%20Field%20Diary%22?f%5B%5D=genre_ms%3A%22spectral+color%22&amp;view_pid=liv%3A000202&amp;view_page=0">http://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search/%221870%20Field%20Diary%22?f%5B%5D=genre_ms%3A%22spectral+color%22&amp;view_pid=liv%3A000202&amp;view_page=0</a></p>
<p>So the issue is slightly different, but still related to tooltips.</p>

<p>However, could you put a touch or left/right padding on these so when they show up they&#39;re not completely against the edge of the screen?</p>
<p>The tooltips on the pages rendered by XSLT (multi-viewer and manuscript viewer) are kind of wonky. They don&#39;t seem to be working in the multiviewer in my iPhone, while the ones on the manuscript viewer appear but are jamming the page from working, as once one appears I can no longer scroll up and down in the transcription.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t the library we&#39;re using qtip doesn&#39;t provide a way to do this consistently as it computes and positions the element, any overrides via CSS just lead to wonky behavior and it&#39;s not exposed through the javascript so that we can make modifications to the algorithm easily.</p>

<p>Seems they were appearing but just unbelievably slowly. They also locked the ability to scroll until they displayed. Fixing this took the better part of day. It should now work just as fast on mobile as it does on desktop.</p>
<p>This is now deployed to production.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Tooltips on the multiviewer now work great. However, I also discovered that the date selection dropdown does not work. If you select a date and click on it, nothing happens on the page.</p>
<p>Tooltips on the manuscript viewer also appear to work well. However, when I open a spectral image, selection a transcription, and then try to view it, I&#39;m not able to move in the transcription either up or down, or right to left. See attached screen shot. It&#39;s stuck like this. More oddly, when I try to scroll up and down, a small scrollbar appears at right, but it seems to be moving the catalogue page <em>behind</em> the transcription.

          <div class="body"><p>Additional text from #119:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve run into issue with the image viewer when looking at it on my iPhone. As I explained, sometimes when I open an image and try to move it around it &quot;skips&quot; i.e., kind of disappears off the screen and I return momentarily to the catalogue. Also, when I last use the view to look at images, select both a second page of an item or a transcription, returned an unfunctioning black screen.</p>
<p>Since this seems to be related to the issue I cited above, I&#39;m putting the text here and closing #119.</p>

<p>This appears to be the same behaviour as on the production site? Should I assume that you want tooltips to disappear if the user continues to scroll?</p>

<p>Spectral transcriptions are also sorted, so thank you x 2.</p>
<p>For tooltips, let&#39;s indeed have it that they disappear when the user starts to scroll again. Can we have it work like this on both regular pages and in the manuscript/spectral image viewer.</p>
<p>Finally, in going back above, I see the reason why you increased the Browse and Search text to 16pt font for mobile. However, I&#39;d only like it that size for mobile. On all big sizes, please take it back to what it is on production. 16pt for iPad and Desktop is too big.</p>
