            <p>In looking at the site on stage on my mobile, I found four minor issues. See screen shots. The first two are taken from the following page but are not exclusive to it: <a href="http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-this-site/leap-2013-2017-project-history-part-ii">http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-this-site/leap-2013-2017-project-history-part-ii</a></p>

<li><p>The tooltips are not the right shade of blue. They should be the same as hyperlinks. See image for the different colors. (This is not exclusively a mobile issue; I just caught it on mobile). The first screen shot below shows this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The images used to illustrate section pages should of course narrow like the text. However, some images are spilling off the page. The second screen shot below shows this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the timeline, occasionally some text is being rendered off the screen. See third screen shot below, text on the left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Critical edition subpages are showing the grid image. See fourth screen shot below.</p>

<p>This issue exists on production as well, it&#39;s cause you have a hard-coded width for the table in the HTML. You&#39;ll have to remove that from the nodes content.</p>

<p>Issue with older iPhones, should be sorted now.</p>

<p>This is because the fields are filled out, if no image is placed in them then no image will appear.</p>

<p>When I do the migration I&#39;ll remove this &#39;place holder&#39; images from the nodes content.</p>

<li>I&#39;ll leave that with you. I&#39;ve added a note about it to ticket #159.</li>
<li>Although what you&#39;ve indicated is correct, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the issue. See screen shot, which shows the same image on prod (left) and stage (right). As you can see, the image on prod -- despite the fixed width -- still sizes correctly on mobile.

<p>If you check with Chrome (and likely other browsers) aside from Firefox / iPhone you&#39;ll see the issue exists on production. </p>
<p>The reason it&#39;s working on Firefox, iPhone is because <code>max-width: 100%</code> is also specified for tables on production. </p>
<p>The spec (the CSS 3 spec for CSS Intrinsic &amp; Extrinsic Sizing refers to the CSS 2.1 spec on this rule) clearly states (<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#width-height-keywords">https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#width-height-keywords</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all elements but non-replaced inline elements, table rows, and row groups
which would mean it should apply to table elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means Chrome is in the wrong, but there&#39;s nothing we can do about that.</p>
<p>Either way for this to work on all browsers you can&#39;t use explicit <code>width</code> on table elements, try instead to use only <code>max-width</code> when you&#39;re specifying that you want the image to be at most a certain size, which should be safe.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Ok, thanks for letting me know and looking into this. Interesting to learn about this shortcoming of Chrome. Is there any way of generating a list of pages with tables/images that have a width set like this? It&#39;s easy to fix, but without list, I&#39;ll have to go through the pages one by one to find the bits to fix.</p>
