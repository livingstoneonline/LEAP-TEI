<ol>
<li>Multiple instances of creator should be separated by a semi-colon, not comma</li>
<li>Please change &quot;Authors&quot; to &quot;Creator(s)&quot;</li>
<li>Repository field is showing Addressee plus repository.</li>
<li>Image credits field appears to be static and exactly the same for each item, whereas it should be pulled dynamically from the MODS like the other field here.</li>

          <div class="body"><p>I can&#39;t pull the image credits from the MODS <em>and</em> replace text with a URL as the text is <strong>not</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language">regular</a>. So I&#39;m currently just pulling whats in the MODS. If you are guaranteed to have only a certain set of copyright types I could match explicitly against those (but cases in which there is a spelling mistake or some such it won&#39;t work), alternatively you could alter the data such the the links and the text that represent them by extending the <code>mods</code> to make use of the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/groups/rmg/">CDL Copyright schema </a> for more info <a href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/accesscondition.html">MODS Documentation</a></p>

          <div class="body"><p>OK, I think there are two easier solutions here:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could take a URL that appears in the MODS Access Condition field and simply hyperlink it. I believe that would be straightforward, no?</li>
<li>I could modify the MODS records so that the access condition field has an &quot;a href&quot; tag with proper URL around any item that should be hyperlinked. I just tested this out and the MODS schema seems to accept it. This change would be easy to make and appears to achieve what we need. Should I go ahead and do it?</li>
