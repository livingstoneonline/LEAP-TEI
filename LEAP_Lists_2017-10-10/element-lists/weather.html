These separate tiers of air con- -tinually overlap each other and strike either side of the elevated Watershed as the Sun has Northern or Southern Declination. When the Sun is South, the Nor WestNorth West wind is cool and heavy, and naturally takes its place nearest the earth, and vice versa - But this subject to a reader possesses ^ nolittle interest - the changes here ^ however occur so regularly that to an observer they have an interest which cannot be realized in our variable climate

            <li>The South East wind from the Indian Ocean and Madagascar sea is the prevailing wind of the year, and more especially of the dry season - Its influence is well marked on the trees on the islands in Bangweolo having their branches stunted or killed on the South 498 Copy letter of 26 March 1869 Ujiji East sides, while those on the Nor WestNorth West sides run out straight - To this side also or away from the South East the trunks are bent - and in the forests, the Lichens cover the South East sides and branches thickly while leaving the Nor WestNorth West comparatively free - the other pre- -vailing wind is the North West from the Atlantic and lowhow damp West coast of Africa is the active agent in the heavy rains - these winds blow constantly - In the dry season when hundreds of acres of dense long grass are burned off every the heated smoke is carried up through the South East, now the lower stratum, into the Nor WestNorth West going the opposite way as the upper statum - In the heavy rains the Nor WestNorth West becomes the lower stratum in turn. These separate tiers of air con- -tinually overlap each other and strike either side of the elevated Watershed as the Sun has Northern or Southern Declination. When the Sun is South, the Nor WestNorth West wind is cool and heavy, and naturally takes its place nearest the earth, and vice versa - But this subject to a reader possesses ^ nolittle interest - the changes here ^ however occur so regularly that to an observer they have an interest which cannot be realized in our variable climate[weather]
