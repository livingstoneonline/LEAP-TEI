<lb/><p>1861</p>
<lb/><p>Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>We returned a few days ago 
<lb/>from a three months<reg>'</reg> tour on the <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>A boat was carried past Murchison's cataracts 
<lb/>a distance of about forty miles. We then 
<lb/>sailed sixty more before entering the Lake 
<lb/>which is over 200 miles in length. It is 
<lb/>from twenty to fifty or more miles broad, 
<lb/>and very very deep. According to our 
<lb/>present experience a ship could find 
<lb/>anchorage only near the shore, but she might 
<lb/>get a rock through her bottom a good way 
<lb/>out besides. There are several rounded 
<lb/>rocky islands covered with dense forest 
<lb/>and uninhabited. Adjacent to those and 
<lb/>also opposite all the rocky headlands 
<lb/>detached rocks jut out or are covered with 
<lb/><choice><sic>with</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> only a few feet of water. The lake 
<lb/>is surrounded by mountains or by 
<lb/>high table lands that appear as such, 
<lb/>the Eastern are higher than the Western<reg>.</reg>

<lb/>A mountainous Cape which we named 
<lb/><placeName>Cape Maclear</placeName> divides the Southern end 
<lb/>into two bays one 30 the other 18 miles 
<lb/>in length. The Lake has thus a forked 
<lb/>appearance there, and with the help of a 
<lb/>little imagination somewhat of the boot 
<lb/>shape of <placeName>Italy</placeName>. We went along the Western 
<lb/>shore and found it a succession of 
<lb/>bays until in the far north the spurs 
<lb/>of the mountains running sheer down 
<lb/>to the water scarcely afforded landing 
<lb/>places. In the south while rounding <placeName>Cape 
<lb/>Maclear</placeName> no bottom was felt with 
<lb/>our sounding line of 35 fathoms. In 
<lb/>the north none was found with a fishing 
<lb/>line of 696 feet but it broke in coming 
<lb/>up and was therefore unsatisfactory<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We were there during the prevalence of the 
<lb/>Equinoctial gales and found that 
<lb/>tremendous seas like those that play off 
<lb/><placeName>Quillimane</placeName> rose in fifteen or twenty 
<lb/>minutes. An Arab dhow lately built to 
<lb/>carry slaves across fled from us twice 
<lb/>to the Eastern shore. We could not cross 
<lb/>though at certain seasons the natives can

<lb/>in their canoes. We never saw so many 
<lb/>people anywhere else as on its shores and 
<lb/>slaving is the only trade - they were upon the 
<lb/>whole very civil. We were objects of great 
<lb/>curiosity to them - no fines were levied 
<lb/>nor dues demanded. Fish abound &amp; 
<lb/>the people seem all fishermen catching with 
<lb/>large trawling nets - creels - hooks, torches, 
<lb/>or poison. One species resembles salmon 
<lb/>or trout in shape and goes up the rivers to 
<lb/>spawn. It tastes somewhat like herring. 
<lb/>Elephants and hippopotami very tame 
<lb/>Alligators seldom kill men so we could 
<lb/>bathe in the delicious cool waters when 
<lb/>we liked. When we passed Lat. 11ยบ 40ยบ South 
<lb/>we were in the borders of a tribe of zulus 
<lb/>called Mazite or Mazitu from the South 
<lb/>(originally: - they live on the highlands West 
<lb/>of the North end of the Lake. Very many 
<lb/>skeletons and putrid bodies of the slain 
<lb/>were seen and the land was depopulated. 
<lb/>We heard of course but one side of the 
<lb/>story and could form no opinion as 
<lb/>to the cause of this terrible slaughter. I 
<lb/>met and had a short interview with 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001692_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>seven of these Marzite, they seemed as 
<lb/>much afraid of me as I ought to have 
<lb/>been of them. We saw some Marzite skulls 
<lb/>on trees and remains of burned bodies so 
<lb/>they do not always come off unscathed<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We returned about as wise as we went 
<lb/>about the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> - plenty of assertions 
<lb/>but in nothing did all agree except that 
<lb/>it is a very large river. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>Col<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">l</hi></hi> Rigby</persName> says <add place="above">in a letter to you</add> that most of the slaves 
<lb/>entered at the port of <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> come from 
<lb/><placeName>Nyassa</placeName> and a small steamer <add place="above">on it</add> would soon 
<lb/>break the neck of the traffic without knowing 
<lb/>his opinion till lately we have been 
<lb/>working towards this and will now be 
<lb/>employed the best part of a year carrying 
<lb/>a vessel past the cataracts<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The bishop will tell you all about 
<lb/>his mission better than I can - three 
<lb/>of his men came up the <placeName>Shire </placeName> in common 
<lb/>country canoes without knowing a word 
<lb/>of the language or a bit of the way, this 
<lb/>feat was never performed by white 
<lb/>men before.  I am &amp;c </p>
