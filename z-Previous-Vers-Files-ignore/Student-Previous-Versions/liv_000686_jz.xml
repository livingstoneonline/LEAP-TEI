<lb/><salute>the Rev<hi rend="sup underline">d</hi> J.J. Freeman
<lb/>My Dear Sir,</salute></opener><!-- Change line info as appropriate -->
<lb/><p>We have indulged
<lb/>the hope for several months past that you would
<lb/>find it convenient to visit us, but having
<lb/>lately heard from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> that you seemed
<lb/>inclined to make <term type="tribe">Kurumen</term><!-- is this a tribe? --> your farthest
<lb/>point North I not take the liberty of entreating
<lb/>you to reconsider your resolution - I hope
<lb/>our <term type="tribe">Kurumen</term> friends will press on your
<lb/>attention the superior claims of the stations 
<lb/>in this quarter to those of the <term type="nationality">French</term> bretheren 
<lb/>by which you propose to return - But before
<lb/>I urge any other consideration I may mention
<lb/>that before undertaking my late journey I 
<lb/>expected to return in time to meet you at 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Kurumen</term> before the departure of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> L.
<lb/>my journey was much longer than I expected
<lb/>and M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> L. wanted 2 months here along -
<lb/>I have been eight months from <unclear cert="low">house</unclear>
<lb/>this year - two of these were spend in trying
<lb/>place <unclear cert="low"> I and</unclear> with the tribe of <term type="tribe">Mokatha</term>

<pb facs="liv_000686_0002" n="0002"/>
<lb/>there is always a great deal of work to be done
<lb/>after an absence from a station - our house is yet
<lb/>unfinished- But were there no other considerations
<lb/>the <term type="animal">oxen</term> are altogether unfit to travel - one half
<lb/>have been worked for six months and have
<lb/>done &amp; endured more than <term type="animal">oxen</term>ever did before 
<lb/>the others have all been affected by a disease
<lb/>which renders them unable to travel
</p>
<lb/><p>For your coming I have to urge - that
<lb/>when you have visited the Colonial stations
<lb/>you have only seen one end of the <app><rdg cert="medium">chain</rdg><rdg>chair</rdg></app>, and 
<lb/>as your advice at home will probably vitally
<lb/>affect the <unclear cert="low">one</unclear> and movement of the whole you
<lb/>ought for your own satisfaction to see the other end 
<lb/>this is the more necessary because the Directors<!-- is this an occupation? -->
<lb/>seem by our expression in the Report for /47
<lb/>to have <unclear cert="low">unbibed</unclear> our erroneous impression
<lb/>as to the position a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> occupies when 
<lb/>beginning with a new tribe - It is stated
<lb/>that I had been under the necessity of returning 
<lb/>to Meelestsa<!-- is this a place? --> - a step I never dreamed of for 
<lb/>although put to shifts from the beginning
<lb/>till now for <term type="foodstuff">vegetables &amp; corn</term>, the uniform
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">kindness</unclear> of the people endeared us to them 

<pb facs="liv_000686_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>and I am fully persuaded that any missionary may
<lb/>live in perfect security ^ <!-- above "with any tribe" --> in so far as the natives
<lb/>are concerned if he have only a decent smack
<lb/>of common sense, so strong is my connection
<lb/>on this point I do not believe there is any necessity 
<lb/>for two europeans to be present with any one tribe 
<lb/>and I should consider giving countenance to a college
<lb/>-gue <!-- mispelled? -->to settle here as inflicting a wrong on some
<lb/>other tribe which might otherwise be enjoying
<lb/>his services - Then again you stated, I think 
<lb/>most truly in a speech delivered in Cape Town 
<lb/>that since teh failure of the <placeName><country>Niger</country></placeName> expedition
<lb/>this must be considered the key to the interior
<lb/>Now we have sailed on the southern end
<lb/>of a navigable highway to a large tract of
<lb/>country - this discovery belongs to Missionaries
<lb/>will you not come in &amp; give your advice 
<lb/>as to how we are to taeke advantage of it
<lb/>If I incur any expense I have the rod offer 
<lb/>vote of disaprobation in committee over my
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">head</unclear> and then the world we have beyond
<lb/>in the North (is that to be left to traders
<lb/>&amp; boers) presseds had on the other side
<lb/>I do most sincerely wish you may be

<pb facs="liv_000686_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>induced to come for many reasons but hope
<lb/>you will be guided by His counsel who 
<lb/>cannot err
