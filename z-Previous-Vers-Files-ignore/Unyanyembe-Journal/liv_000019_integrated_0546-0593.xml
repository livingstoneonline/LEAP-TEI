<lb/>and bushes</term> cannot spare the few inches
<lb/>of soil required for the side of the foot, and
<lb/>down he comes into the slough - the path
<lb/>often runs along the bed of the rivulet for <!-- geog:  -->
<lb/><measure>sixty or more yards</measure>, as if he who first
<lb/>cut it out went that distance <del type="strikethrough">along</del> seeking
<lb/>for a part of the forest less dense for his
<lb/>axe - In other cases the "<term type="plant"><hi rend="underline">Muale</hi>" palm</term>
<lb/>from which here as in <placeName><country>Madagascar</country></placeName> grass
<lb/>cloth is woven and called by the same
<lb/>name "<hi rend="underline"><foreign xml:lang="mg">Lamba</foreign></hi>", has taken possession
<lb/>of a valley - the leaf stalks as thick as a

<lb/>all passage save by a path made and
<lb/>mixed up by the feet of <term type="animal">elephants</term> and
<lb/><term type="animal">buffaloes</term> - the slough therein is groan
<lb/>compelling and deep - Every now and

<lb/>panting = the sweat trickles down my
<lb/>face and I suppose that I look as grim
<lb/>as they though I try to cheer them with
<lb/>the hope that good prices will reward
<lb/>them as the coast for ivory obtained with
<lb/>so much toil - In some cases the
<lb/>subsoil has given way beneath the
<lb/><term type="animal">elephants</term> enormous weight - the deep hole
<lb/>is filled with mud, and one taking it
<lb/>all to be <measure>about calf deep</measure>, steps in to
<lb/>the top of the thigh, and flaps on to a

<lb/>are covered with living <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetable</term> bridges -
<lb/>a species of dark glossy leaved grass with
<lb/>its roots and leaves felts itself into a mat
<lb/>that covers the whole stream = When stepped
<lb/>upon it yields twelve or fifteen inches and
<lb/>that amount of water rises up on the leg -
<lb/>At every step the foot has to be raised high
<lb/>enough to place it on the unbent mass in
<lb/>front - This high stepping fatigues like
<lb/>walking on <seg type="weather">deep snow</seg> - Here and there
<lb/>holes appear which we could not sound
<lb/>with a stick six feet long - they gave the
<lb/>impression that anywhere one might
<lb/>plump though and finish the chapter -
<lb/>There the water is shallow the <term type="plant">Lotus</term> or
<lb/>sacred <term type="plant"><choice><sic>lilly</sic><corr>lily</corr></choice></term> sends its roots to the bottom,
<lb/>and spreads its broad leaves over the
<lb/>floating bridge so as to make believe that
<lb/>the mat is its own, but the grass referred to
<lb/>is the real felting and supporting agent,
<lb/>for it often performs duty as bridge where no
<lb/><term type="plant"><choice><sic>lillies</sic><corr>lilies</corr></choice></term> grow - The bridge is called by the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Manyema</term> - "<foreign xml:lang="und"><term type="plant">Kintefwetefwe</term></foreign>"<!-- Not sure on this spelling. Or if it should be marked as a plant. EM --> as if he

<lb/>large belts of the primeval forest still stand
<lb/>into these <seg type="weather">the sun though vertical cannot
<lb/>penetrate except by sending down at
<lb/>midday thin pencils of rays into the
<lb/>gloom - The rain water stands for months
<lb/>in stagnant pools made by the feet of ~
<lb/><term type="animal">elephants</term></seg> - and the dead leaves decay
<lb/>on the damp soil and make the water
<lb/>of the numerous rivulets of the colour
<lb/>of strong <term type="plant_foodstuff">tea</term> - The <term type="plant">climbing plants</term>

<lb/>The ancient path is the only passage - When
<lb/>one of the giant trees falls across the
<lb/>road, it forms a wall breast high to be
<lb/>climbed over - and the mass of tangled
<lb/>ropes brought down makes cutting a
<lb/>path round it a work of time which
<lb/><orgName>travellers</orgName> never undertake - the shelter of
<lb/>the forest from the sun makes it
<lb/>but the roots of trees high out of the soil
<lb/>across the path keep the eyes <term type="animal">ox</term>like on
<lb/>the ground - The trees are so high that
<lb/>a good shotgun does no harm to
<lb/><term type="animal">parrots</term> or <term type="animal">guinea fowls</term> on their tops
<lb/>and they are often so closely planted 
<lb/>that I have heard <term type="animal"><choice><sic>gorillahs</sic><corr>gorillas</corr></choice></term> here called
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="und"><term type="animal">Sokos</term></foreign> -<!-- Should this be marked as animal. EM --><!-- Yes :) HB --> growling about <measure>50 yards off</measure>

<lb/>It exhibits no more <w>arch<add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">it</add>ectural</w> skill

<lb/>Here he sits in <seg type="weather">pelting rain</seg> with his

<lb/><p>Bad water and <seg type="weather">frequent wettings</seg>

<lb/>in <placeName><region>Marungu</region></placeName> I had <term type="ailment">pneumonia</term> = the illness

<lb/>in preparing to follow the river but my <!-- geog: Lualaba, I think. HB -->
<lb/>attendants were fed and lodged by the

<lb/>away <add place="marginleft"><metamark function="insertion"/>from <lb/>the <lb/>camp</add> on trade and pretended to fear going

<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="river">Lualaba</geogName></placeName></orgName> were reported by the <orgName>slaves</orgName> to
<lb/>be remarkably friendly - I have heard

<lb/>found them - Elsewhere I could employ

<lb/>Lakes are in no sense sources for no large river

<lb/>to the phenomena of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName>. The structure
<lb/>and economy of <placeName><geogName type="watershed">the watershed</geogName></placeName> answers very much
<lb/>the same end as the great Lacustrine rivers but <!-- Again, Lacrustine? HB -->
<lb/>I cannot at present copy <bibl>a lost Despatch</bibl> which
<lb/>explained that - The mountains on <placeName><geogName type="watershed">the watershed</geogName></placeName>

<lb/>From their bases I found that the springs of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName>
<lb/>do unquestionably arise - this is just what <persName>Ptolemy</persName>
<lb/>put down &amp; is true geography - We must accept that

<lb/>passes current in modern times - Before <del type="strikethrough">the</del>
<lb/>leaving the subject of <placeName><geogName type="watershed">the watershed</geogName></placeName> I may add that I
<lb/>know about <measure>600 miles</measure> of it, but am not yet satisfied
<lb/>for unfortunately the <measure>7<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> hundred</measure> is the most interesting
<lb/>of the whole - I have a very strong impression that

<lb/>to <placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName> -  the half South to <placeName><region>Inner <placeName><country>Ethiopia</country></placeName></region></placeName> -
<lb/>These fountains at no great distance off become <!-- geog: fountains of the Nile -->
<lb/>large rivers, though at the mound they are not

<lb/>I had to feel my way - and every step of the
<lb/>way &amp; was generally groping in the dark,
<lb/>for who cared where the rivers ran - Many a <!-- geog: Great rivers -->
<lb/>weary foot I trod ere I got a clear idea
<lb/>of the drainage of the <placeName><geogName type="valley">Great <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName> Valley</geogName></placeName> - the

<lb/>all the rivers of the Upper part of that valley <!-- geog: Great Nile Valley -->
<lb/>flowed into <placeName><geogName type="lake">Tanganyika</geogName></placeName> - But the Barometer
<lb/>told me that to do so the water must flow
<lb/>uphill - the great rivers &amp; the great lakes
<lb/>all make their water converge into the deep
<lb/>trough of the valley which is <measure>a full inch of
<lb/>the Barometer lower than the Upper <placeName><geogName type="lake">Tanganyika</geogName></placeName></measure> -
<lb/>It is only a sense of duty which I trust <term type="occupation">your

<lb/>in no boastful style the mistakes of others who have
<lb/>bravely striven to solve the ancient problem, and it will
<lb/>be seen that I have cogent reasons for following the

<lb/>He also divined on the <bibl>Koran</bibl> and it told the

<lb/>in search of me and from the people above
<lb/>mentioned that returned from a camp

<lb/>I understood but few of the words that
<lb/>flew off their glib tongues of the women

<lb/>to compare them with those of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Nile</geogName></placeName> lower

<lb/>whom I had seen with guns and felt inclined
<lb/>to reprove them for bringing them into the

<lb/><orgName>Another party</orgName> down at the canoes rained their

<lb/>It was horrible to see one head after another

<lb/>and going down - some of the men who
<lb/>got canoes out of the crowd paddled quickly
<lb/>with hands and arms to help their friends

<lb/>when he told him that he was about to 
<lb/>start it was not forthcoming - It was 
<lb/>probably destroyed to prevent my seeing
<lb/>the list of goods you sent by one 
<lb/><persName>Hassani</persName> to <placeName><settlement type="town">Unyanyembe</settlement></placeName> -</p>
<lb/><p>With due deference to your judgement
<lb/>I claim all the expenses incurred as
<lb/>set down against me in <bibl><persName>Ludha</persName>'s 
<lb/>books</bibl> from the <orgName>Banians</orgName> who by fraud
<lb/>converted the caravan to help me into
<lb/>the gratification of their own greed -
<lb/><persName>Muhamad Nassur</persName> can reveal
<lb/>the names of the other <orgName>Banian</orgName>
<lb/>accomplices of <persName>Shereef</persName> who connived

<lb/>in supplanting help for me into a trade <w>specu-

<lb/><persName>Ludha</persName> and let them (the <orgName>Banians</orgName>) recover
<lb/>from <persName>Shereef</persName> - I report this case to <orgName><choice><abbr>H.M.</abbr><expan>Her Majesty's</expan></choice> -
<lb/>Government</orgName> as well as to you and believe
<lb/>that your hands will thereby be strengthened 
<lb/>to see that justice is done and that due
<lb/>punishment be inflicted on the <orgName>Banians</orgName> -
<lb/>on <persName>Shereef</persName> and <persName>Awathe</persName> - and on the <orgName><orgName>Banian</orgName> 
<lb/><orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> who baffled and thwarted me instead
<lb/>of fulfilling the engagement entered into
<lb/>in your presence - <bibl>A note</bibl> is enclosed to 
<lb/><persName>His Highness Seyed Benghash</persName> which you
<lb/>will please to present -</p>
<lb/><p>In entrusting the matter of supplies and men to the <persName>Baman Ludha</persName> you seem to have
<lb/>been unaware that our <orgName>Government</orgName> <w>for-
<lb break="no"/>-bids</w> its <orgName>servants</orgName> to employ <orgName>slaves</orgName> - the <w>com<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>missioners</w> and <term type="occupation">Consul</term> at <placeName>Loanda</placeName> on the 
<lb/><placeName><region>West Coast</region></placeName> sent all the way to <placeName>St <persName>Helena</persName></placeName> for <!-- Not exactly sure if St. Helena is a village/region/etc.? HB -->
<lb/>somewhat stupid <orgName>servants</orgName> rather than incur
<lb/>the displeasure of the <orgName>Foreign Office</orgName> by 
<lb/>using very clever <orgName><term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> <orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> within
<lb/>call - In the very trying circumstances 
<lb/>you mention during the visitation of <term type="ailment">Cholera</term>
<lb/>and in the absence of the instructions I had 
<lb/>enclosed to employ <orgName>free men</orgName> and not <orgName>slaves</orgName>
<lb/>as also in the non appearance of the cheques 
<lb/>for money enclosed in the same <bibl>lost packet</bibl>
<lb/>the call on <persName>Ludha</persName> was perhaps the easiest
<lb/>course and I trust that you will not
<lb/>consider me ungrateful if I point out
<lb/>that it involved a grave mistake - <persName>Ludha</persName>
<lb/>is polite enough but the <orgName>slave trade</orgName> and 
<lb/>indeed most other trade is carried on chiefly
<lb/>by the money of <orgName>Banians</orgName> - <orgName><term type="nationality">British</term> subjects</orgName>
