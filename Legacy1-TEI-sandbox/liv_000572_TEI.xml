<lb/>population found me in my monkish all a few days ago as happy 
<lb/>as any of you domesticated animals and (<foreign xml:lang="la">mirerbile dictu</foreign>) first on 
<lb/>the eve of becoming one myself. <foreign xml:lang="la">Tempus muntantar</foreign> &amp;c. But 
<lb/>I cannot leave the <choice><sic>batchelor</sic><corr>bachelor</corr></choice> life without a sigh. What infatuation 
<lb/>you labour under to rejoice after having <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">had</add> your nose held to the 
<lb/>"grindstone" for such a length of time and what infatutation I am 
<lb/>under myself. In love!! words yea thoughts fail so I leave it to your 
<lb/>imagination &amp; recollection -- I am it seems after all to be 
<lb/>hooked to <persName>Miss Moffat</persName>, (<choice><sic><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffats</persName></sic><corr><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>'s</corr></choice> eldest daughter) in about three 
<lb/>weeks hence. I am just finishing my house. It is something like 
<lb/>your own I suppose, <add place="above">only</add> rather more primitive. 52 feet in length &amp; 
<lb/>20 broad, containing a study bedroom &amp; parlour - , &amp; pantry, kitchen 
<lb/>apart from the house. Is it stone do you think? Nay but 
<lb/>a much easier material to mould, viz. plastic mud. We dash 
<lb/>it on about a foot thick and then cut it straight with a spade 
<lb/>and such is the heat of the luminary that <persName>Fairbrother</persName> would call 
<lb/>the sun over our heads before two hours you would wonder 
<lb/>where the water has gone. Indeed one <choice><sic>hours</sic><corr>hour's</corr></choice> exposure makes 
<lb/>it difficult to cut. We <unclear cert="medium">run</unclear> up walls in no time after the <w>found<supplied cert="high">-</supplied>

<lb/>good dear fellow know of my marriage. It will comfort all 
<lb/>your hearts to know I am become as great a fool as 
<lb/>any of you. The pickle he was in at the time he wrote 
<lb/>the note predicates something in the population line I suppose 
<lb/>But he did not mention among his other duties the washing of 
<lb/>the baby's <unclear cert="medium">unmentionables</unclear>. <space extent="3" unit="chars"/>He <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> stick in the world nor will 
<lb/>I if I can help it. </p>
<lb/><p>Now after the above nonsense I must give you something 
<lb/>better if I can. And first of all I must tell you that this 
<lb/>station has been recently formed by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> &amp; myself

<lb/>which works in iron &amp; wood, the founderies are of the

<lb/>if the refusal is in a joculent or friendly manner they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice>
<lb/>seem to take it ill. They have cleared their conscience and had 
<lb/>they gone away without making a <unclear cert="low">trial</unclear> they would have perhaps 
<lb/>felt its stings. Deceitful, liars to a man and as proud as 
<lb/>Lucifer if they think you are under any sort of obligation 
<lb/>or dependant for anything on them. I should say in general 
<lb/>we ought to place but little dependance on a <orgName>native</orgName> <choice><orig>untill</orig><corr>until</corr></choice> we 
<lb/>get him into Heaven, and as a rule of conduct Let us 
<lb/>act with uniform kindness to them expecting that at one 
<lb/>time or other they will repay it with ingratitude, perhaps 
<lb/>insult. It will be a great misfortune if we (as some have) 
<lb/>allow our tempers towards them to become <unclear cert="medium">soured</unclear> or 
<lb/>disgusted. I know one who has placed confidence on 
<lb/>many and having been ungratefully treated his talk regarding 
<lb/>them would savour badly if reported any where. The case 
<lb/>is instructive. I have tried as much as possible to avoid 
<lb/>making the conduct of others to me any part of my rule 
<lb/>of conduct to them and have got on comfortably sometimes 
<lb/>when others got broken heads (much grief) <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>Our <term type="occupation">chiefs</term> are

<lb/>The "Boguera" or circumcision is more (or rather entirely) a 
<lb/>national civil right than religious observance. It takes

<lb/>was looked upon by the early <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>  as sinful, 
<lb/>They keep it secret as a measure &amp; perhaps this was one 
<lb/>portion of the reason why the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> came to the 
<lb/>conclusion. You will <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> that war proclaimed against 
<lb/>this might easily be interpreted as war against the feudal 
<lb/>system which exists &amp; it was so, and this jealousy for 
<lb/>the existing form of government was very extensively 
<lb/>engendered, this has been a great hindrance to the spread 
<lb/>of <term type="faith">Christianity</term>. Each <term type="occupation">chief</term> is absolute lord of his people 
<lb/>He knows all their affairs &amp; they <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> transact any

<lb/>a vengeance after <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>, <persName>Hamilton</persName> &amp;c had preached to 
<lb/>him so long. But we must be charitable &amp; hope against hope 
<lb/>that it was true. The <term type="nationality">French</term> <orgName>missionaries</orgName> have been 
<lb/>very successful among the <term type="tribe">Basutos</term> to the eastward of us 
<lb/>and a great deal under God has been owing to the influence 
<lb/>of an enlightened but unbelieving <term type="occupation">chief</term>. He has never 
<lb/>like the others thrown obstacles in the way, on the contrary 
<lb/>has encouraged the people to attend to the instruction 
<lb/>of the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>. Our <term type="occupation">chief</term> is a real <persName>Johnny Raw</persName> 
<lb/>but he is kind as yet &amp; civil &amp; encourages the people 
<lb/>to attend our meetings. You speak of the expedition 
<lb/>to endeavour to make peace. Had you been here 
<lb/>church members would not have been deemed acknowledgement 
<lb/>of the <term type="occupation">teachers</term> as <term type="occupation">chiefs</term> &amp; a certain attack would have

<lb/>You seem to have been shocked by the indecency of the

<lb/>the thigh is the <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> female dress when working. The 
<lb/>men have a <unclear cert="low">nondescriptum</unclear> always and the <orgName>Caffres</orgName> go 
<lb/>stark naked. I have seen the men stand in the presence 
<lb/>of <orgName>European</orgName> females with as little consciousness of
