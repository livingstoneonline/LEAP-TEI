<lb/><p><space unit="words" extent="7"/><placeName><geogName type="river">Lake Nyassa</geogName></placeName> - 28 August
<lb/><space unit="words" extent="12"/>1866</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="chars" extent="3"/>My Dear <persName>Tom</persName></p>
<lb/><p><space unit="words" extent="3"/>We have had a long &amp; weary trudge from <placeName><region>the 
<lb/>coast</region></placeName> up to this and have been almost shut up from letting <!--geog: Lake Nyassa -->
<lb/>our whereabouts be known. The <orgName><orgName>Arab</orgName> <term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName> traders</term></orgName> all
<lb/><choice><sic>skiddadle</sic><corr>skidaddle</corr></choice> as soon as they hear of our approach and away 
<lb/>they go scuttling through pathless forests. I entrusted <bibl>one 
<lb/>letter about the <orgName><term type="occupation">sepoys</term></orgName></bibl> to a <term type="occupation">chief</term> to be given to a <orgName><term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName> trader</term></orgName>
<lb/>for I had no hope of looking one in the face, and at the 
<lb/>time I gave it I had small hopes of its ever reaching its <w>destina
<lb break="no"/>-tion</w> for the fellows must conclude that they were bearing 
<lb/>no good news about themselves - I write however in 
<lb/>case I may light on one as I did on <persName>Seph Rubéa</persName> by accident 
<lb/>he heard that I was famishing and came forward like a 
<lb/>man and brother with an <term type="animal">ox</term> and big bag of <term type="foodstuff">flour</term> - We had 
<lb/>just accomplished a march of <measure>eight days across</measure> a <w>depopu
<lb break="no"/>-lated</w> tract of country and he with some 800 <orgName>slaves</orgName> was just 
<lb/>entering on it - I had made forced marches on the 6<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> &amp; 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day 
<lb/>to buy food and send it back to the weaker <choice><sic>bretheren</sic><corr>brethren</corr></choice> - 
<lb/>all but four had given in, when this good <orgName><orgName>Samaritan</orgName> <term type="occupation"><orgName>slave</orgName>
<lb/>trader</term></orgName> took the precaution of taking the bull by the horns. 
<lb/>"The <term type="people">English</term> coming" - "Why what can the <orgName>christians</orgName> want but 
<lb/>our <orgName>slaves</orgName>", and off they all scamper - This dread of the <term type="people">English</term>
<lb/>has the disadvantage that I cannot get a dhow though there 
<lb/>are two on the Lake for fear that I should burn it -</p> <!-- geog: Lake Nyassa -->
<lb/><p>The country is a gradual slope from <placeName><region>the coast</region></placeName> up to <!-- geog:  -->
<lb/><measure>within fifty miles of this shore</measure> - When within the influence 
<lb/>of the humidity of the <placeName><geogName type="ocean">Indian Ocean</geogName></placeName> the forests are dense 
<lb/>to a painful degree - one could no more take bearings of 
<lb/>his position unless he were a <term type="animal">baboon</term> then if he tried to 
<lb/>use his instrument out of the bunghole of a hogshead. 
<lb/>Further up it is more often forest but still so thickly
<lb/>planted that one very seldom sees the horizon - at the 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="confluence">confluence of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Rovuma</geogName></placeName> &amp; <placeName><geogName type="river">Loendi</geogName></placeName></geogName></placeName> we came on a 
<lb/>tract of country destitute of provisions and here the 
<lb/><orgName><term type="occupation">sepoys</term></orgName> entirely failed me - they had done their best to 
<lb/>kill the beasts of burden by way of forcing me to turn &amp; 
<lb/>they certainly succeeded in some instances - The <term type="insect">Tsetse</term> 
<lb/>probably helped but the experiment was vitiated - The 
<lb/><orgName><term type="occupation">sepoys</term></orgName> were morally unfit for travel and then we had 
<lb/>hard lines all of us - food was not to be had for love or 
<lb/>money - our finest cloths only got miserable morsels 
<lb/>of the <term type="plant_foodstuff">common grain</term> - I trudged it the whole way
<lb/>and having no animal food save what <term type="animal">turtle doves</term>
<lb/>and <term type="animal">guinea fowls</term> we occasionally shot I became 
<lb/>like one of the <term type="occupation">Pharaoh's</term> lean kine. the last tramp 
<lb/>that referred to above brought us to a land of plenty.

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002501_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>It was over a very fine country but quite depopulated
<lb/>I counted in <measure>one <choice><sic>days</sic><corr>day's</corr></choice> march</measure> fifteen running burns 
<lb/>and this in the dry season - The country was then undulating <!-- geog:  -->
<lb/>and mountainous - generally from 2000 to 3000 <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">then 4000</add> feet 
<lb/>above the sea - cool &amp; pleasant - The <orgName>people near <placeName><region>the 
<lb/>coast</region></placeName></orgName> are called <term type="tribe">Makonde</term> - then <term type="tribe">Matambwe</term> - then <term type="tribe">Makoa</term>
<lb/>then <term type="tribe">Waiau</term> or <term type="tribe">Waiyau</term> - the <term type="tribe">Ajawa</term> further south 
<lb/>and lastly <term type="tribe">Manganja</term> or <term type="tribe">Wanyassa</term> here on the Lake <!-- geog: Nyassa -->
<lb/>The principal <term type="occupation">chief</term> named <persName>Mataka</persName> lives on <placeName><region>the watershed</region></placeName>
<lb/>overlooking this but <measure>fifty miles or more distant</measure> --
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">his town</settlement></placeName> contained a thousand houses many of <!-- settlement: Mataka's -->
<lb/>them square in imitation of the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> - Large patches 
<lb/>of <term type="plant_foodstuff"><term type="nationality">English peas</term></term> in full bearing grow in the moist 
<lb/>hollows or were irrigated - <term type="animal">Cattle</term> <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> that no 
<lb/><term type="insect">Tsetse</term> existed - When we arrived <persName>Mataka</persName> was just 
<lb/>sending back a number of <term type="animal">cattle</term> &amp; <orgName>captives</orgName> to their 
<lb/>own homes - they had been taken by <orgName>his people</orgName> without 
<lb/>his knowledge from <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> - I saw them by 
<lb/>accident <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>there were 54 women and children --
<lb/>about a dozen young men &amp; boys and about 25 or 
<lb/>30 head of <term type="animal">cattle</term> - as the act was spontaneous it 
<lb/>was all the more gratifying to witness - From  
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town"><persName>Mataka</persName>'s</settlement></placeName> I sent the <orgName><term type="occupation">sepoys</term></orgName> back - a more useless 
<lb/>lot I never saw - It was all against the grain that 
<lb/>they came, and they had such a sullen hangdog expression 
<lb/>of face <orgName>the country people</orgName> used to remark of them - "these 
<lb/>are the <orgName>slaves</orgName> of the party".</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="1"/>To come back to <placeName><geogName type="lake">Nyassa</geogName></placeName> was like visiting an old 
<lb/>home I never expected to see - The roar of the waves 
<lb/>and a dash in the breakers or rather rollers was quite 
<lb/><choice><sic>exhilerating</sic><corr>exhilarating</corr></choice> - We get <term type="foodstuff">milk</term> here and often fine 
<lb/>fresh <term type="animal">fish</term> very like <term type="animal">herring</term> in taste &amp; appearance
<lb/>These are putting flesh on our bones - Where 
<lb/><persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Roscher</persName> came I cannot make out - Nobody 
<lb/>knew him as a <orgName>European</orgName> and no one knows 
<lb/>his name - <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I believe he travelled as an <orgName>Arab</orgName>.
<lb/>I have to stand a deal of staring as the first <term type="nationality">English</term>
<lb/>man they ever saw but a <term type="animal">poodle dog</term> is as popular 
<lb/>as anyone - His appearance is so terrific to the 
<lb/><term type="animal">country curs</term> that they flee from him as if he were 
<lb/>a <term type="animal">lion</term> and he chases them as if he believed the 
<lb/>same thing of himself - I think his fierce appearance 
<lb/>arises from it being difficult to decide at 
<lb/>which end his tail lies - the rest of <orgName>my party</orgName> 
<lb/>do pretty well</p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002501_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="1"/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>I sometimes remember you with some anxiety 
<lb/>as not knowing what opening may be made 
<lb/>for you in life. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>The Dear of Ely <!-- Adrian, not sure what this is? HB --> - the <persName><unclear cert="medium">Red</unclear> Harvey <!-- Adrian, not sure if this is just a non-sup abbr for Reverend? HB -->
<lb/>Goodwin</persName> said to me that he might be able to do some 
<lb/>thing to help forward the education of my children. 
<lb/>The <orgName><orgName>church of <placeName><country>England</country></placeName></orgName> people</orgName> have much in their 
<lb/>power - It is a rich Establishment, and they have
<lb/>many educational <choice><sic>priveleges</sic><corr>privileges</corr></choice> of which we have
<lb/>scarcely a vestige in <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName> - they have presentations 
<lb/>to schools and colleges which provide for young 
<lb/>men of ability, and open up higher situations - though 
<lb/>I do not know how your tendencies be I wrote to 
<lb/><persName><term type="occupation">Professor</term> Sedgwick</persName> to put the <term type="occupation">Dean</term> in mind of 
<lb/>his kind intentions - the <bibl>letter</bibl> will go with this 
<lb/>and I should he write to <persName>D<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Buchanan</persName> or <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Young</persName>
<lb/>you will have made up your mind what to 
<lb/>answer - They require very thorough scholarship, 
<lb/>and I have no doubt but you are working for 
<lb/>that with a <app><rdg>will</rdg><rdg>wile</rdg></app> - If you incline to the mercantile line 
<lb/>you will require to be a year or two in a <term type="occupation"><choice><sic>merchants</sic><corr>merchant's</corr></choice></term>
<lb/>office in <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>, but whatever you feel yourself best 
<lb/>fitted for "Commit thy way unto the Lord" Trust also in him 
<lb/>and he will bring it to pass" - One ought to endeavour to devote 
<lb/>the peculiarites of his nature to his Redeemer's service whatever 
<lb/>these may be - Many make mistakes, as for instance a person 
<lb/>of a solid practical turn of mind &amp; body, looking to a minister of a 
<lb/><unclear cert="high">fervid</unclear> impulsive nature as his model - and aspiring to that 
<lb/>for which he was never intended - <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Young</persName> you will find a  
<lb/>good counsellor and a warm friend - you can scarcely go 
<lb/>wrong with his advice - It would be well to visit them as 
<lb/>often as convenient - <persName><term type="occupation">Captain</term> Sherard Osborne</persName> said to me 
<lb/>that he could assist you in his line that is get you a situation 
<lb/>in an <orgName><term type="nationality">Indian</term> Railway</orgName> - they are well paid but you could 
<lb/>look to that only if you enetered on it - I said that I would tell you
<lb/>Let nothing come between your work of mental preparation 
<lb/>for the present <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>--</p>

<lb/>reaped its fruits in a miserable destitute depopulated 
<lb/>country - It is one great forest with mountain &amp; flood 
<lb/>very fine to look at but toilsome - dripping with 
<lb/>showers every day - small patches of millet at wide 
<lb/>intervals &amp; scanty population who have nothing to sell

<lb/>porridge</term> &amp; <term type="plant_foodstuff">Mushrooms</term> - woe is me - good enough to produce 
<lb/>fine dreams of the <term type="foodstuff">Roast beef</term> of Old <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> but nothing else
<lb/>I have become very thin - thought I was so but now 
<lb/>if you weighed me you might calculate very easily how much 
<lb/>you might get for the bones only but I take on flesh easily &amp; 
<lb/>we got a <term type="animal">cow</term> yesterday &amp; I am to get <term type="foodstuff">milk</term> tomorrow &amp; will wait 
<lb/>a little with the <term type="occupation">chief</term> <persName>Chitapangowa</persName> a good fellow so far as we
<lb/>have seen him - I am on <placeName><region>the Watershed</region></placeName> I think at last about 4500 <choice><abbr>ft</abbr><expan>feet</expan></choice> 
<lb/>above the sea - We crossed one range 6600 feet &amp; then a spot where 
<lb/>I grieve to write it poor <term type="animal">Poodle</term> "<foreign xml:lang="und">Chitane</foreign>" was drowned - We had 
<lb/>to cross a marsh a mile wide &amp; waist deep - bottom soft peaty 
<lb/>stuff in which one did well enough but deep holes made by <term type="animal">buffaloes</term>
<lb/>feet caused us flounder - I went over first &amp; forgot to give orders about 
<lb/>the <term type="animal">dog</term> - all were too much engaged in keeping his balance to notice 
<lb/>that he swam among them till he died - He had more spunk than a 
<lb/>hundred <term type="animal">country dogs</term>, took charge of the whole line of march - ran to 
<lb/>see the first in the line then back to the last &amp; barked to haul him up 
<lb/>then when he knew what hut I occupied would not let a 
<lb/><term type="animal">country cur</term> come in sight of it &amp; never stole himself - He was 
<lb/>becoming yellowish red like the <term type="animal">country dogs</term> - and he shared 
<lb/>the starving with me - We have not had any difficulties 
<lb/>with the people - made many friends - imparted a little 
<lb/>knowledge sometimes and raised a protest against <orgName>slaving</orgName> 
<lb/>very widely - some will remember what was said &amp; at all 
<lb/>events a beginning was made - Some <orgName><orgName>black</orgName> <orgName>slaves</orgName></orgName> from 
<lb/><placeName><region>the Coast</region></placeName> were found here - their first visit - but they go off 
<lb/>tomorrow &amp; I try the experiment of sending <bibl>letters</bibl> - a few half 
<lb/>ready in ones &amp; hope they may reach you. The rains hold us 
<lb/>back but we hope to be at our second supply of goods 
<lb/>at <placeName><geogName type="lake">Tanganyika</geogName></placeName> by May - not a line has come to me 
<lb/>from <placeName><region>the coast</region></placeName> so I am as ill off for news of you as you 
<lb/>may be of me. I have but nine <orgName>African</orgName> boys with me 
<lb/>the <orgName><placeName><geogName type="island">Johanna</geogName></placeName> men</orgName> ran back in sheer terror of the <term type="tribe">Mazitu</term> or
