<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Senna</placeName>6 <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> April 1860 </p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>By the fragments of our 
<lb/>lost mail bag which were picked up by some 
<lb/>
seven miles West of the shoal where they were 
<lb/>set afloat, we <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the very cheering news 
<lb/>that you were returning to the <placeName>Cape</placeName>, and that 
<lb/>your good Bishop was guiding a mission 
<lb/>from the Universities of <placeName>England</placeName> to the Interior of this country. Right good tidings 
<lb/>they are, and I am extremely glad &amp; thankful 
<lb/>in consequence. I had written you in 
<lb/>the supposition that you were in <placeName>England</placeName>. 
<lb/>I now add a little information of considerable 
<lb/>importance to us all. </p>
<lb/><p>We met our friend <persName>Major Secard</persName> at 
<lb/><placeName>Mazaro</placeName> last week on his way to <placeName>Kongone 
<lb/>harbour</placeName> to hoist the Portuguese flag and 
<lb/>possibly build some sort of fort <hi rend="underline">alias</hi>
<lb/>custom house. This is by orders from high 
<lb/>quarters. We gave him a sketch of the route 
<lb/>through the mangroves of the Delta to guide 
<lb/>him to the point where he will find two 
<lb/>flagstaffs ready made by <persName>Captain Berkeley</persName>
<lb/>of H.M.S. Lynx. When in line they 
<lb/>point out the deep channel across the bar.

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001557_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>The <placeName>Kongone</placeName> was quite unknown to the Portuguese 
<lb/>authorities but the conjecture of the <persName>Governor of Quilimane</persName> that it may have been used for shipping slaves by native born Portuguese 
<lb/>
is probably correct = only there is no evidence in the way of barracoons or stockades remaining<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>A <persName>Senhor Cruz</persName> of <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> was the 
<lb/>great slave emigration agent of <placeName>Bourbon</placeName> for 
<lb/>two years. When the French bullied the Portuguese 
<lb/>in <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>, <persName>His Excellency of Mozambique</persName> uttered 
<lb/>a strong <choice><sic>denuntiation</sic><corr>denunciation</corr></choice> of all &amp; sundry who had 
<lb/>dared to promote French emigration. He must 
<lb/>have been entirely ignorant of the existence of 
<lb/><persName>Cruz's</persName> regular experts though nobody else 
<lb/>was; and he invariably told our naval officers 
<lb/>that he was accused of bribery, but falsely, 
<lb/>as he has gained nothing by coming out 
<lb/>here but the loss of his health. We sympathize 
<lb/>with the poor man, as worse things have 
<lb/>been said of ourselves. <persName>Cruz</persName>, however, 
<lb/>slipped over to <placeName>Bourbon</placeName> till the blast of 
<lb/>indignation was past, then came (a few 
<lb/>weeks ago) back to <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> with a 
<lb/>sugar mill &amp; coffee cleaning machine - 
<lb/>superior sugar canes &amp; coffee seeds &amp; 
<lb/>two skilled Frenchmen. All sent by the 
<lb/><persName>Governor of Bourbon</persName>, and the <persName>Governor 
<lb/>of Mozambique</persName> sent orders to all the authorities 
<lb/>here to assist them in every means in 
<lb/>their power. The Frenchmen died, it is said 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001557_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>of fever, but the coffee &amp; sugar cane are planted<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The Portuguese hate us partly because of our 
<lb/>religion, but chiefly because our nation 
<lb/>has opposed the slave trade, and largely benefitted 
<lb/>Portugal. And all desire the French to come 
<lb/>and occupy this country. This was avowed 
<lb/>to me by the <persName>Governor of Quilimane</persName> in 
<lb/>a conversation I had with him lately at 
<lb/><placeName>Shupanga</placeName>. He avers that <placeName>Portugal</placeName> having 
<lb/>no population to spare it is natural to 
<lb/>look to <placeName>France</placeName>. We see that <placeName>France</placeName><w>colon-<lb break="no"/>izing</w> here would be a death blow to all our 
<lb/>hopes for the civilization of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. <persName>Cruz</persName>
<lb/>bribed largely in favour of a brother 
<w>in-<lb break="no"/>law</w> named <persName>Marianno</persName>, who had a stockade 
<lb/>at the mouth of the <placeName>Shire</placeName>, and by slave 
<lb/>hunting among the Manganja powerfully 
<lb/>aided in the French emigration scheme. 
<lb/>He will get <persName>Marianno</persName> back again by next 
<lb/>October, but this time to aid in forming 
<lb/>French slave plantations in <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> - 
<lb/>He <add place="above"><persName>(Marianno)</persName></add> will then have undergone a sentence 
<lb/>of three years imprisionment at <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>
<lb/>for rebellion and murder. Matters are 
<lb/>kept as secret from us as possible, 
<lb/>but if we have good information that a 
<lb/>half caste from <placeName>Quilimane</placeName> has engaged 
<lb/>the Bajaua to join him in slave forays 
<lb/>against the very Manganja among whom 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001557_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>we lately travelled. They are spoken of as 
<lb/>"conquistada" one man with a few slaves 
<lb/>conquering the Bajaua who are great 
<lb/>slave traders themselves, simply means, 
<lb/>he had induced them to kidnap by the 
<lb/>help of his guns those who have none. 
<lb/>My old friends the Boers used to speak in 
<lb/>the same pompous manner when doing 
<lb/>the same dirty deeds. You will now <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice>
<lb/>that I have reason to be glad to hear of a 
<lb/>prospect of the introduction of a better system, 
<lb/>and that you have returned to promote that 
<lb/>and every other good work. I like the plan 
<lb/>of the Universities sending forth missions 
<lb/>like those in ancient times, and I know 
<lb/>of no more inviting field than the the Highland 
<lb/>Lake region. The proposal to have a 
<lb/>bishop to head the party is an admirable one, 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">and</del> should they secure an energetic prudent 
<lb/>leader there can be no doubt of their ultimate 
<lb/>success. I am sure I wish the mission may 
<lb/>prosper from the very bottom of my heart. </p>
<lb/><p>I have lost my communications from 
<lb/>Government &amp; do not know whether we are to 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">have another ship</hi>. If one is sent we ought to be 
<lb/>authorized to hoist a Pendant - for the sake of the 
<lb/>effect it would have on our Portuguese (open 
<lb/>friends but) secret enemies. She must remain at 
<lb/>the Cape till next rise in November as we 
<lb/>hope to be back to <placeName>Kongone Harbour</placeName> from the <placeName>Makololo COuntry</placeName> on the 30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of that month<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p rend="center">Ever Affectionately yours <persName>D. Livingstone</persName></p><addSpan spanTo="#p1r-01" place="marginright"><!--addSpan/@place='right hand margin of fol.01'--></addSpan>
<lb/><p>I take the liberty of troubling you to draw some money as by the enclosed receipt.
