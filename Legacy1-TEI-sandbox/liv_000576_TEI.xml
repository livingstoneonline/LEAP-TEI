<lb/>a letter from <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Williams</persName> and He too has departed. He 
<lb/>has been the means of establishing a Welsh Missionary 
<lb/>Magazine and his letter contained earnest entreaties for 
<lb/>correspondence for it. I shall begin immediately 
<lb/>&amp; furnish the needful as far as my abilities go. I 
<lb/>wish I were more able to furnish intelligence. I have 
<lb/>been so busy of late I could not do anything and 
<lb/>what was all the fuss about do you think only about 
<lb/>being married. I am sorry I had not an opportunity 
<lb/>of telling you before this for it was settled long
<lb/>ago &amp; not long ago it only seemed long to me. It was 
<lb/>a few months since &amp; I had to build a house after 
<lb/>I was engaged. Well I am hooked now &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Drummond</persName>
<lb/>will no longer have it in his power to accuse 
<lb/>me of being a monk. By the way I am glad you 
<lb/>have heard from him and &amp; that our dear departed 
<lb/><persName>Miss Marshall</persName> heard <choice><sic>to</sic><corr>too</corr></choice> before she died. He says to 
<lb/>me "revere her memory" &amp; utters many affectionate 
<lb/>things respecting her, <!--mike: squiggle--> who can speak otherwise 
<lb/>respecting her. I never heard that to which you 
<lb/>refer &amp; am sure she never had any thoughts 
<lb/>such as those presented to her by -- As for myself 
<lb/>I never thought myself good enough to aspire so high 
<lb/>I may mention that my wife is in bodily appearance 
<lb/>very much like her only a great deal stouter</p>

<lb/>Moore</persName> during the time he was writing to me. It runs 
<lb/>thus Dear <persName>Chisholm</persName>, my hands are so full having to 
<lb/>cook fetch water, sweep rooms &amp;c &amp;c that I have only 
<lb/>time to say I hope you are enjoying the presence of our 
<lb/>beloved saviour &amp; prospering abundantly in your 
<lb/>work. <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>My <choice><sic>hearts</sic><corr>heart's</corr></choice> desire is that you may never 
<lb/>labour in vain Here alas everything goes wrong - The

<lb/>distress truly - the Union Jack upside down &amp; no 
<lb/>mistake But I must not crow over poor <persName>Joseph </persName>
<lb/>for I too am married <space extent="2" unit="chars"/>I am at present at 
<lb/><placeName>Kuruman</placeName> but intend leaving a week or two for 
<lb/><placeName>Mabotsa</placeName>, this place begins to assume an air of 
<lb/>prosperity and this chiefly by the residence of 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>. He has toiled manually ever since he 
<lb/>came, building repairing thatching improving in 
<lb/>everything &amp; makes me see that a great deal 
<lb/>can be done when one's heart is in this work, His 
<lb/>excellencies make the differences of those who 
<lb/>had the care of the station more apparent <space extent="1" unit="chars"/>But I 
<lb/>must not praise now that he is my father 
<lb/>in law</p>
<lb/><p>At <placeName>Mabotsa</placeName> matters go on pretty well But I 
<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> expect to remain there long. The sphere is 
<lb/>too small for the missionaries, as I am the 
<lb/>younger I propose to go to the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> of 
<lb/>either <persName>Bubi</persName> or <persName>Sechele</persName>. If I remained at <placeName>Mabotsa</placeName>
<lb/>the utmost I could hope for would be the part of 
<lb/>introduction of the gospel to a tribe while by going 
<lb/>to another it would be an introduction of the 
<lb/>gospel wholly by my intrustrmentalility the additional 
<lb/>labour &amp;c does not weigh anything in the 
<lb/>calculations so I think I shall go as soon as poss</p>
