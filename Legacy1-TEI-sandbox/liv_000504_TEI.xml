<lb/><p rend="right">Tropic of Capricorn, Long. 28ยบ 10โฒ E,</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1842</p>
<lb/><p>My very dear friends</p>
<lb/><p>You will see by the date if this that I am coming nearer 
<lb/>you, I am not quite certain whether I am actually on the Tropic but by a 
<lb/>dead reckoning carried on from the last observation I had an opportunity 
<lb/>of taking I am very near it, if not perhaps a few miles on the northing 
<lb/>of it. I am at present with <persName>Bubi</persName> one of the chiefs of the <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> or 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakone</term> as it is sometimes spelled. I have come for the purpose of helping 
<lb/>a native teacher to commence operations amongst them &amp; as far as we 
<lb/>have proceeded with them we have found all to our wishes. A great cause 
<lb/>of thankfulness to him who thus opens up our way amongst a fickle people. 
<lb/>I read one of your letters on Sunday evening last &amp; it brought back to my 
<lb/>recollection many pleasing thoughts. It was so full of kindness I resolved to 
<lb/>devote the only remaining large sheet of paper at present with me to you. 
<lb/>But I fear I cannot give you anything like the ideas of this country which the 
<lb/>actual presence in it gives. It is prodigiously large, &amp; I think there are 
<lb/>far more wild animals than human beings in it. During our long 
<lb/>journey hither we came to no village except one &amp; that did not contain 
<lb/>500 of a population<reg>.</reg> But every day we were sure of seeing large herds of 
<lb/>different kinds of game. In travelling - there is not much to excite interest 
<lb/>one has to keep near the waggon not so much for conveyance as defence<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Lions abound, they seldom however shew themselves in the day but make 
<lb/>a disgreeable noise at night, the Rhinocerous is exceedingly like a gigantic <unclear cert="low">big 
<lb/>Pig</unclear> both in his motions &amp; general appearance<reg>.</reg> But I need not begin to 
<lb/>describe animals, I may however mention that one loses much of the 
<lb/>feelings with which we think of them while in England, even on serpents 
<lb/>&amp; the enormous centipedes disgusting at first from their size &amp; length I 
<lb/>now look with indifference &amp; like the natives I walk among the long grass 
<lb/>as tall in some parts as myself without the least apprehension, I am very 
<lb/>much astonished at the change which has taken place on my mind in so 
<lb/>short a time, had anyone told me of it beforehand I could not have credited it 
<lb/>for the first one I nearly trod upon 6 or 7 feet in length almost petrified 
<lb/>me. By thinking of this change you will understand how inhabitants of 
<lb/>tropical climates can live just as well as you do in England 
<w>notwithst-<lb break="no"/>anding</w> all the reptiles which would destroy our comfort if more sensitive <del type="strikethrough">on the</del><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I intend remainig here for 6 weeks &amp; them proceeding still further to the North 
<lb/>in order to visit other tribes still more distant, they are so few &amp; far 
<lb/>scattered it will be impossible or rather impolitic for the people at home 
<lb/>to supply them with European <unclear cert="low">mind</unclear>! If we were stationed here all 
<lb/>the best portions of his time would be occupied in travelling towards the 
<lb/>colony for supplies &amp; oxen will be pretty well worn out before reaching 
<lb/><placeName>Kuruman</placeName>. Native teachers are the only hope &amp; unless we can open up 
<lb/>a route to <placeName>Delagoa Bay</placeName> or some other on the West Coast<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>I have with me an excellent man as teacher, today he began school for 
<lb/>the children, the chief himself collecting them for him. I could not go near 
<lb/>to see how he was getting on for if I had only looked at the little naked 
<lb/>brats an instant dispersion of the whole school would have taken place, their 
<lb/>terror at the sight of a white face though mine scarcely merits that 
<w>appel-<lb break="no"/>ation</w> now is extreme, even girls of 10 years scream with terror if brought 
<lb/>forcibly by their parents for medicine. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his chief is the most sensible 
<lb/>I have seen among chiefs of <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>. He is not considered legally chief 
<lb/>but by his own abilities has drawn around him a number of people 
<lb/>equal to that of the legal chief. This latter a greedy nasty fellow is very 
<lb/>anxious to fight but being afraid to try alone has been soliciting and in 
<lb/>different quarters against <persName>Bubi</persName>. In order to defend himself better <persName>Bubi</persName>
<lb/>has recently taken up his residence on a hill about 600 feet high, &amp; 
<w>surrou-<lb break="no"/>nded</w> on all sides by rocky precipitous approaches. It is about 1/2 a mile 
<lb/>broad at the top. I outspanned at the bottom but he came down &amp; pressed 
<lb/>me to ascend on another side where the ascent was less steep. Here then 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000504_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>on a cool spot I shall remain a little, my presence will probably deter the other fellow 
<lb/>fromm attempting anything, <persName>Bubi</persName> feels this &amp; is perhaps more kind than he 
<lb/>in other circumstances might be. He brings milk to me morning &amp; evening 
<lb/>himself, just now sent a huge pot of beer &amp; when I proposed to him yesterday 
<lb/>to pay for the milk &amp;c. I received, he said, "No, drink my milk &amp; eat 
<lb/>my corn &amp; let your heart feel pleasant so long as you remain &amp; don<reg>'</reg>t say 
<lb/>anything about payment" "I can<reg>'</reg>t hear of it<reg>.</reg><reg>"</reg> Some of his people went with 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> &amp; <unclear cert="low">S</unclear> to K. there received me with great joy, the wild bursts of 
<lb/>laughter by which they testified it was very gratifying, and what to me was 
<lb/>amusing was the enquiry some of them put respecting an old ox of mine left 
<lb/>behind to rest himself, "Where is Canute?" &amp;c. I suppose their affection is 
<lb/>about as strong for the oxen as for myself, the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> are devotedly 
<lb/>attached to cattle. My establishment consists of a Driver &amp; Leader, the 
<lb/>latter is necessary because no reins are used. He goes before &amp; leads the two front oxen 
<lb/>the driver manages to propel the ponderous machine by guiding and thrashing the animals 
<lb/>with a whip as long as a fishing rod. He is the commander in chief &amp; presides at 
<lb/>meals &amp;c. and his orders are implicitly obeyed. He cooks, washes shirts &amp; is the 
<lb/>sort of valet of the owner of the waggon. Mine is a heathen but the most 
<lb/>energetic obliging fellow I have seen amongst them, more so indeed than most 
<lb/>of the Christians. I took him on account of his energy &amp; hope to be useful 
<lb/>to him. He is besides a famous Nimrod &amp; we never want a supply of 
<lb/>meat if I only allow him powder &amp; shot. My leader is a Christian &amp; an 
<lb/>amiable man, when a boy he was driven out of his own country by <persName>Mozilikatze</persName>
<lb/>he requested to come with me because he was poor &amp; wanted to make a 
<lb/>little money to buy a cow. A few beads to assist him in trading for foxes 
<lb/>skins has made him very grateful. My native teacher <persName><unclear cert="low">Tomore</unclear></persName> is 
<lb/>the son of an old heathen chief &amp; has considerable influence wherever he 
<lb/>goes. He is a good man &amp; far before most of his countrymen in knowledge<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He has resolved to bring his wife &amp; children here as soon as the corn is cut<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It being still green was the cause he left her behind when we set out<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>All his father<reg>'</reg>s family are Christians &amp; when they became so one after another it was 
<lb/>a great affliction to the old man. He looked upon them as dying &amp; now they are all dead 
<lb/>as he expresses it. He says sometimes his heart sweats &amp; he should like to be a 
<lb/>Christian but how can he give up his wives (he has 3 or 4)<reg>.</reg> Last year he came 
<lb/>to this part of the country seeking another &amp; being much annoyed by his sons who 
<lb/>accompanied him for the purpose of trading, preaching wherever they came<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He at last proposed to precede them to the next town. He came to this &amp; the next 
<lb/>village &amp; told the people that some men would soon follow who would begin &amp; talk 
<w>nonsen-<lb break="no"/>se</w> But they must not believe them it was all lies - When his last son <persName>Moffat</persName> went 
<lb/>to <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> for the purpose of being admitted to the church, the old man manifested violent anger 
<lb/>and in addition to sending off a messenger to bring him back by force went about <unclear cert="low">steaming</unclear>
<lb/>at a great rate against Believers for three days. But at length fearing his other dead sons 
<lb/>would be offended with him, he went to them privately &amp; said "you know my sons that I 
<lb/>am a man of the world, It is necessary for me to make this shew in order to please 
<lb/>my fellow chiefs still in heathenism, never mind me but go on praying as before  
<lb/>Don<reg>'</reg>t stop for me or anything I may say or do, such is old <persName>Seretse</persName> father of my friend <persName><unclear cert="low">Tomore</unclear></persName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Another man <unclear cert="low"><persName>P.s. sowaat</persName></unclear> constitutes the whole of my establishment. You will think I 
<lb/>have enough to support But it is not so difficult to support them here as it is at 
<lb/>home, although it is much more so here than in India the abundance of game is 
<lb/>a great help. Everything is eaten except the wolf between whom &amp; the natives a most 
<lb/>determined enmity exists because he is the enemy of their cattle. The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>never eat fish &amp; hold them in the greatest detestation, perhaps this owing to those 
<lb/>of <placeName>Kuruman River</placeName> being deleterious to <gap agent="illgblDel"/> most stomachs, they are disgusting 
<lb/>looking things, having a broad flat head &amp; a kind of <unclear cert="low">beard</unclear> &amp; without scales - On 
<lb/>our way here we halted on the banks of a stream containing three parts, as <unclear cert="low">T</unclear>
<lb/>asserted that fish always even in small quantity acted as emetics to him &amp; other 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> I took out a few with a pin in order to try the experiment on him 
<lb/>again<reg>.</reg> He ate them with rellish &amp; no vomiting took place. I think if the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>knew the difference of the different kinds they would soon add another article 
<lb/>to their already large bill of fare. Certainly they are preferable to the flesh of Rhinocerous<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>They are perfectly tame having never been troubled by the <unclear cert="low">arms</unclear> of the angler - I at one time 
<lb/>intended to make a collection of insects &amp;c. for <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> P.</persName> but after some further endeavours 
<lb/>I am obliged to give up the idea, the butterflies are very beautiful but my fingers are too 
<lb/>clumsy for them &amp; the heat is so great that when dead they are quite brittle &amp; the jolting 
<lb/>of the waggon makes them crumble to powder. She must therefore excuse me on that 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">head</unclear>. I shall endeavour to send some other things not so frail as insects, the box 
<lb/>for the college I have sent. There was an opportunity for one only but I have told 
<lb/><persName>Professor Owen</persName> I shall entrust yours to his care by the next opportunity. It will be 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000504_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>June or July before I reach <placeName>Kuruman</placeName> &amp; it may be some time after that before an 
<lb/>opportunity occurs of sending, of course this letter remains by me till then. I hear 
<lb/>nothing but Sithuana &amp; hope to make more progress toward the attainment of the 
<lb/>language in this - than when mixing with Europeans. I read addresses long ago 
<lb/>in it but of course full of imperfections. It is a poor language except in what relates 
<lb/>to cattle &amp;c. Energy is expressed chiefly by reputation, the loudness of the tone &amp; gestures more 
<lb/>or less violent according to its intensity. You may understand the meaning of a <unclear cert="low">far</unclear>
<lb/>by the way the speaker elevates his voice <choice><sic>Untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> it is lost in a rough sort of breathing 
<lb/>straining the eyes in the direction spoken of &amp; repeating the word for it incessantly<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Theological terms have all to be constructed for them &amp; <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> they have learned their 
<lb/>meaning, It is all greek to them. If I should speak to the people here in this 
<lb/>language used in the new Testament scarsely one in this whole tribe would 
<lb/>understand what I said, I believe not one. They are all children &amp; are as easily 
<lb/>amused as they. A few buttons or beads <unclear cert="low">puts</unclear><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/> the wisest among them into 
<lb/>extremes. As a whole they are exceedingly ungrateful, mean to the last degree<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Liars for the sake of lying &amp; the most disobeying selfish nation on the face of the 
<lb/>earth. The Christians don<reg>'</reg>t lose this character when they make a profession. There 
<lb/>are exceptions however you must remember but they are few &amp; far between<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>If you are habitually kind to anyone you are more to spoil him, the Christian ones 
<lb/>never knew an exception to this. He becomes impudent &amp; <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/>  &amp; a slanderer<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>We have therefore to labour for this good with a certainty of getting no thanks 
<lb/>for them. Those who are nearest missionaries are the worst. Believers at 
<lb/>a distance on receiving a visit from us receive us with great joy &amp; it 
<lb/>is really a pleasure to visit them - &amp; it is so with friends in heathen towns 
<lb/>but still the chief expense of the friendship devolves on the stranger. By <unclear cert="low">working</unclear>
<lb/>on their character as expressesd above (the universal testimony by all the missions 
<lb/>I have met in this country confirms it) I have found no difficulty in getting on 
<lb/>well with them. I scarcely ever propose anything to those with whom I have to 
<lb/>do without pointing out the personal advantage - make stops in dispensing 
<lb/>favours, never ask one to do anything because he can do it better if there is a 
<lb/>poor person who can do it in any way &amp; who would esteem employment a 
<lb/>favour. All those I have now with me are obliging in the greatest degree, &amp; I 
<lb/>have not been obliged to reprove one of them &amp; the chief reason is I allow 
<lb/>them to carry their little stocks of merchandise in the waggon &amp; give them an 
<lb/>opportunity of trading when we come to a village by remaining a day or two at it 
<lb/>&amp; if a very good bargain offered, they know they can make a draught 
<w>before-<lb break="no"/>hand</w> on their wages to secure it. Besides the tea you so kindly gave <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/>
<lb/>is occasionally produced on a wet day or after a fatiguing day<reg>'</reg>s work 
<lb/>a cup of tea has wondeful effect on their tempers or when we get a 
<lb/>large animal &amp; then they eat &amp; laugh all day long, suppose it is Sunday 
<lb/>&amp; we have got a good fat wild horse the day before, the pot is never cool 
<lb/>one large potful disappears one after another all the day. In these <unclear cert="low">cases</unclear>
<lb/>bread is never thought of, the lean is dipt in the fat &amp; down it goes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Different modes of cooking are continually in process &amp; during the intervals 
<lb/>of eating some one begins a hymn in which all <unclear cert="low">form</unclear> but a concert of 
<lb/>screech owls might be denominated the "music of the spheres" coompared to 
<lb/>the spelling books are also in request but it seems only to ease their consciences 
<lb/>these are occasionally taking up, these are our company, <persName><unclear cert="low">Tomore</unclear></persName> is 
<lb/>not quite so bad as the others<reg>.</reg> But it would be a great offence indeed if 
<lb/>temperence were insisted on I should be scandalized over the <del type="strikethrough"><unclear cert="low">old</unclear></del> whole country 
<lb/>as one who starved my people &amp; instead of being anxious to go with me 
<lb/>I should find it difficult to get a complement for the waggon -</p>
<lb/><p>I have lately become acquainted with some excellent friends. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><unclear cert="low">Lempe</unclear></persName>
<lb/>of the French mission. They are as polite as we think the <gap agent="illegible"/> &amp; amiable 
<lb/>&amp; kind even to a fault, the same may be said of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Helmore</persName> of <placeName><unclear cert="low">Sekatlon</unclear></placeName>. 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> L.</persName> is at <placeName>Mohito</placeName> about 35 miles from <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>, they were lately most anxious 
<lb/>I should take up my abode with them for 3 or 4 months - in time during which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r Edwards</hi></persName>
<lb/>is on a visit to the colony. But I prefered coming here. Both of them speak Eng. well 
<lb/>but I can converse with the children only by means of <gap agent="illegible"/><reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May 1842 Perhaps you may dislike this patchwork like letter but I have just to 
<lb/>write as I have opportunity. I hope therefore you will excuse me. After finishing 
<lb/>what is above, I was busied for a month directing the people how to lead out the water 
<lb/>of their river, &amp; after that was finished on one side I left this &amp; proceeded to the North 
<lb/><choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> I arrived within 2 days of the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>, my route skirted the great sandy 
<lb/>desert which lies to the West of this<reg>,</reg>  the sand completely exhausted the strength of the oxen 
<lb/>3 of them were sick &amp; one died. If any of the others failed I saw my waggon must 
<lb/>stand still. There was no water nearer than 1/2 a day before us &amp; behind us nearly a whole 
<lb/>day. I directed our people to endeavour to take them back &amp; remain at that water <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice>
<lb/>I should return from the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>. We were received with great kindness 
<lb/>by the chief <persName>Sekomi</persName> &amp; in addition to a present of an elephant<reg>'</reg>s tusk in value sufficient 
<lb/>to pay <persName><unclear cert="low">Tomore's</unclear></persName> salary the first half year, I have him for myself &amp; this is a 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000504_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>is the hand of our Father providing. I had no authority from the Directors but thinking 
<lb/>good could be done I could not want their sanction but rather suffer the loss myself  
<lb/>but loss it can<reg>'</reg>t be called for it is spent in the service of him from whom are all 
<lb/>that I have &amp; to him all should be dedicated. I ought to have said in addition to the Ele 
<w>-<lb break="no"/>tusk</w> I lived on his bounty for a fortnight. This town is larger than any I have 
<lb/>seen in this country but the huts are miserably small<reg>.</reg>  We lived in one as large as 
<lb/>the chiefs &amp; three of us could not sleep in it without kicking each other unless the fire was out<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I then visited the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> another portion of the Bechuana nation, they are in bad 
<lb/>repute among the other tribes so much so some of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> who accompanied me 
<lb/>refused to go to them. The reason is a few years ago they poisoned a trader 
<lb/>&amp; his people in order to get his waggon &amp;c. They heard by one of <persName>Sekomi<reg>'</reg>s</persName> people 
<lb/>that I was on the way to visit them &amp; the whole tribe fled my presence, they said 
<lb/>to him that foreigner must be coming to kill us on account of the waggons we 
<lb/>destroyed, there were only three who had courage to look me in the face at my first 
<lb/>entrance into the town, the chief &amp; two others but after I had sat &amp; talked a while with 
<lb/>them the others ventured to come from their hiding places. If anyone ought to have 
<lb/>feared it ought to have been myself but I was quite amused with this <unclear cert="low">???</unclear> instead 
<lb/>of being terrified myself. When the others came near I could not help feeling sad 
<lb/>for I saw pieces of gun locks hung round their necks &amp; other things which I am 
<lb/><anchor xml:id="envelopePosition" type="positionMarker"/> sure belonged to these unfortunate visitors - one had a piece of the waggon sail 
<lb/>round his head &amp; another a piece of a tin jug attached to his ear. They shewed 
<lb/>considerable uneasiness <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> they got a bowlful of porridge cooked for me &amp; saw me eating of it heartily. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his seemed to give them more satisfaction anything I had 
<lb/>before said. Next day I assembled them &amp; told them of the Blood which cleanses them 
<lb/>from all sin &amp; earnestly hope some of these murderers may yet turn to that <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="damage"/>
<lb/>fountain of mercy. <persName><unclear cert="low">Tomore</unclear></persName> was then taken with fever &amp; so ill I feared we should 
<lb/>not remain long tegether, &amp; to add to the difficulty I had given away all the medicine 
<lb/>I had brought with me. A copious bleeding relieved him considerably when it 
<lb/>was at its height. The <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> felt great anxiety on his account as in the 
<lb/>event of his death they would be blamed by the neighbouring tribes. All their 
<lb/>native remedies were put into requistion but the fever ran its course &amp; left 
<lb/>him very weak. I then left him &amp; <add place="above">having</add> requested <persName>Sekhomi</persName> to send men for one of 
<lb/>my oxen. When they arrived I sent them on for <persName><unclear cert="low">Tomore</unclear></persName>. We then bid <persName>Sekomi</persName>
<lb/>farewell &amp; instead of riding myself I had the pleasure of walking about 70 miles <gap extent="1" unit="lines" agent="illegible"/>

<lb/>him back a faithful report of all the wonderful things I had told him of. 
<lb/>When I came back here I found an embassy of 16 men from a 
<lb/>chief of the <term type="tribe">Wanketze</term> who lives in the desert 200 miles West of this, the 
<lb/>tribes to the Southward wish to plunder him of his cattle &amp;c<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000504_0005"/><!--pb/@n='1r'-->
<lb/>He lives so far in the desert almost without water they are unable to attack him. He sent ambassadors to them &amp; his own brother murdered 
<lb/>them, again he sent others who passed his brother by another route. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hose to whom they went assured him that they were friendly to him 
<lb/>told him to leave the desert, come out &amp; sow corn, (his own ardent wish as he may get nothing but roots &amp; the flesh of his cattle where he is) And  
<lb/>at the same time they were purchasing horses in order to attack him. His object in sending to me is to ascertain 

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000504_0006"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>the truth. If I should say come out He will come with his people directly. But I can<reg>'</reg>t bid him now He would be safe with me so
