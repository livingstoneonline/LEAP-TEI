<lb/><p rend="right">Kuruman 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 1841  </p>
<lb/><p>My dear friend</p>
<lb/><p>having lately travelled in company with <persName>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> R. Edwards</persName> a distance 
<lb/>between 6 &amp; 700 miles in the interior of this country and visited many tribes 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> some never before seen by missionaries, I lose no time in 
<lb/>transmitting you some information respecting the state &amp; prospects of the 
<lb/>cause of Christ among them.</p>
<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>you are already aware are divided into a great many 
<lb/>distinct tribes or clans and they extend a great way into the Interior<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Many of them have not yet been visited by any European, the language 
<lb/>of the whole is however essentially the same varying less in proportion 
<lb/>to the extent of country they occupy than do the different dialects in 
<lb/>the provinces of our own empire. The feudal system of 
<w>govern-<lb break="no"/>ment</w><unclear cert="low">obtains </unclear> amongst them in all its glory and in many respects 
<lb/>they resemble the Ancient Highlanders. Each clan is governed by its 
<lb/>own chieftain who comes into office by right of birth and although 
<lb/>hereditary succession produces just the same effects here as in more 
<lb/>civilized countries, each chief looks upon himself as a wiser &amp; 
<lb/>better man than <unclear cert="low">all</unclear><add place="above">of</add> his tribe and superior to all his contemporaries<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>He has the power of Life &amp; death - the administration of the laws and 
<lb/>many <unclear cert="medium">prerequisites</unclear> of office. Although he has councellors who in 
<lb/>public assemblies are allowed by law to use the greatest freedom 
<lb/>of speech towards him, yet all the people are in a state of abject 
<lb/>subjection to his authority. The different tribes possess with 
<lb/>respect to each other feelings similar to those of the chiefs to their 
<lb/>fellows. One tribe calls itself a race of kings &amp; superior to all 
<lb/>others while a neighbouring tribe indulges the same lofty pretensions 
<lb/>to superior dignity in the scale of humanity. This clannish pride 
<lb/>has fortunately vanished considerably during the last 10 years or so 
<lb/>but previous to that period it stood at such a height. It was 
<lb/>hardly possible for missionaries to endure it. No foreigners were 
<lb/>could be equal in  point of wisdom &amp;c. to the royal <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>, conseq
<lb/>uently to deal with them a large stack of patience &amp; self denial 
<lb/>were <del type="strikethrough">requisite</del><add place="above">needed</add> and these seem to have been possessed in the requisite 
<lb/>degree by <persName>Read</persName>, <persName>Hamilton</persName> &amp;c. Those devoted pione<add place="above">e</add>rs of this Mission 
<lb/>who have now grown <del type="strikethrough">old</del><add place="above">grey</add> in their work of faith &amp; labour of love 
<lb/><unclear cert="medium">At present</unclear> only the remnants of this haughty spirit prevail<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Very few consider themselves equal to foreigners and we can 
<lb/>now travel through the whole country without fear of molestation<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The question now becomes one of interest, to what is this 
<w>favor-<lb break="no"/>able</w> change to be attributed? and to us whose prejudices are on the 
<lb/>side of the gsopel it would be pleasant could we place it to the 
<lb/>account of the operation of that mighty agent<reg>.</reg> But when we 
<lb/>take a retrospective glance at the events which have transpired 
<lb/>in this country within the last 20 years and examine the state 
<lb/>&amp; feelings of those who have been most in contact with 
<w>Missi-<lb break="no"/>ons</w> and those also who on account of their distance know nothing 
<lb/>at all about these things we shall be compelled to give the credit 
<lb/>of the change to an instrumentality far less to be admired<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But while we cannot feel any complacency in the instrument   

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000496_0002"/><!--pb/@n='76v'-->
<lb/>or the operations we cannot help adoring the superintending Providence of 
<lb/>Himwho has in all ages &amp; countries carried on his purpose right through 
<lb/>heart of human wickedness &amp; canstantly brought good out of evil<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>And since in this country a great good has followed the horrid scourge 
<lb/>of war  <del type="strikethrough">may</del><add place="above">one</add> we <del type="strikethrough">not be</del> justified in turning our eyes with intense interest 
<lb/>to another large portion of the world, long shut against the gospel, wher 
<lb/>war is now actually in progress, and confidently expect that however 
<lb/>unjustifieable the pretext for that may be, it will eventually turn out 
<lb/>for the advancement  of that <del type="strikethrough">place</del><add place="above">kingdom</add>  which consists of righteousness &amp; 
<lb/>peace. <add place="inline">The finder of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> rendered them one once nearly as insensible to the 
<lb/>gospel  as the <unclear>laves</unclear> in China <gap extent="1" unit="lines" agent="illegible"/></add></p>
<lb/><p>At a time when pride &amp; arrogance were rampant amongst the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>a large swarm of marauders more savage than they camr pouring 
<lb/>down <add place="above">from the interior</add> upon those nearer to the colony. Their cruelties &amp; successes 
<lb/>spread terror though the whole country, one tribe fell before them 
<lb/>after another <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> they were thought invicible by the thousands 
<lb/>of fugitives who flocked towards the south; But a few mounted 
<lb/>Griquas with guns succeeded in <unclear cert="low">routing</unclear> the whole with immense 
<lb/>slaughter of the invaders &amp; scarcely any loss to themselves<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>By &amp; bye came another swarm  more dreadful than the former 
<lb/>under <persName>Moselekatsi</persName>, they spared none except the young men who 
<lb/>were capable of being soldiers. The old men with the women &amp; children 
<lb/>were all cruelly butchered. As in the former case those who <add place="above">could</add>escape 
<lb/>fled in terror in this direction and <persName>Moselekatse</persName> following came 
<lb/>with 2 miles of <placeName>Kuruman</placeName>. There, having ventured to capture the 
<lb/>waggons of some  Boers &amp; put some of them to death he  aroused 
<lb/>the vengeance of their relatives who although a mere handful in 
<lb/>number <unclear cert="low">routed</unclear> &amp; compelled him to retire far into the Interior. There 
<lb/>successive defeats of powerful marauders have contibuted more towards 
<lb/>producing an impression of the superiority of Europeans than anything 
<lb/>else. This applies more especially to the tribes who have not been 
<lb/>subjected to the scourge of European warfare. What the effect is in 
<lb/>the minds of the people of <persName>Moselekatse</persName> I have not had an opportunity 
<lb/>of ascertaining. Most probably they are "chafed in their minds" 
<lb/>and the possibilty of our intercourse with them may for a long 
<lb/>time be retarded.</p>
<lb/><p>Those tribes which in the time of danger flocked around the 
<lb/>mission stations have <del type="strikethrough">mostly</del><add place="above">all</add> retired, not  so far inland as they 
<lb/>formerly were. The terror of <persName>Moselekatse's</persName> name wis still 
<w>every-<lb break="no"/>where,</w> fresh in their minds preventing <del type="overwritten">their</del><add place="over-text">them</add><del type="strikethrough">return northwards</del>. But 
<lb/>there is one unfortunate feature in the character of all the tribes 
<lb/>who have been within the sphere of missionary operations 
<lb/>they know somewhat of the requirements of the gospel but 
<lb/>they are all decidedly averse to it. Those tribes who have 
<lb/>never been near missionaries always behaved with more respect 
<lb/>&amp; kindness than those who had. At a point 250 miles nearly 
<lb/>directly north, the people had never before seen a white face. 
<lb/>There they were all we could expect a savage nation to be &amp;  
<lb/>forcibly reminded us of those in a similar state in the South Seas<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>There was no begging, no <gap extent="3" unit="words" agent="illegible"/>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000496_0003"/><!--pb/@n='77r'-->
<lb/>After <add place="above">having</add> overcome their fears <add place="above">sufficiently</add><del type="strikethrough"><unclear cert="low">of that</unclear> first approach sufficiently</del> they gazed 
<lb/>in astonishment at everything they saw &amp; then brought presents of milk &amp;. 
<lb/>When we went into the town the women peeped past the corners <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice>
<lb/>we approached nearer &amp; when they fled into the houses - the children screamed 
<lb/>in terror - and the very dogs wanted not to bark but were as 
<w>precip-<lb break="no"/>itate</w> in their flight as if they had seen a lion, (the chief of this 
<lb/>place too was the most sensible of this kingly tribe I have seen amongst 
<lb/>them. For in general they are regular fools)<reg>.</reg> Another tribe which 
<lb/>received us courteously was found busily employed in the manufacture 
<lb/>of large wooden bowls, each bowl being hollowed out from the 
<lb/>section of a large tree, costs an immense deal of labour, in addition 
<lb/>to this they were smelting iron for knives<reg>,</reg> spears<reg>,</reg> axes`&amp;<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>This manufacture seemed in its crudest state. ndeed it seems 
<lb/>in their hands to be exactly in that state I suppose Tubal Cain 
<lb/>left it. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he furnace is built of clay, two leathern bags 
<lb/>with clay tubes to enter the furnace, a piece of the bark of a tree 
<lb/>bent upon itself, and a huge stone grasped in both hands 
<lb/>constitute the bellows, tongs, hammer &amp; another stone the anvil 
<lb/>of these antediluvian <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/><add place="above">artificers</add> in iron. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he ore in abundance 
<lb/>they find in the neighbouring mountains. To make up 
<lb/>for the want of knowledge in the manufacture &amp; frequent 
<lb/>in burning the iron to a cinder, they have  
<lb/>many superstitions such as abstinence from connubial 
<lb/>intercourse for several months during which they work
<lb/>the iron &amp;c. &amp;c. There are also manufactures of <del type="strikethrough">brass</del> copper &amp;tin amongst them but these have more superstitions still<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Indeed the further we went towards the north we found 
<lb/>superstition increasing &amp; probably it does increase <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice>
<lb/>we reach the region where idols are worshippeed<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>All whom we visited far in the interior treated us with great 
<lb/>respect &amp; listened attentively to the preaching of the gospel, this att<hi rend="sup">n</hi>
<lb/>of course can be attributed to nothing but the effect of novelty<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But I am persuaded they are much more\likely to receive the 
<lb/>gospel than those who live within 100 or 150 miles of this 
<lb/>&amp; who generally now merit the appellation of scorners &amp; refector of the truth<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>You may be surprised to hear that the state of matters exists amongst those 
<lb/>who lately lived near mission stations. But what else can be expected 
<lb/>from heathens in their sins only occasionally hearing s detached sermon 
<lb/>or two. <del type="strikethrough">If we</del> Before we can reasonably hope for much success 
<lb/>the truth must be brought to bear repeatedly on the mind of the same 
<lb/>individual. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he heathen are in a totally different position from 
<lb/>people at home - there, a single sermon may convert <choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut here 
<lb/>it is hardly possible for the truth to find its way through the thick 
<lb/>darkness which shrouds the mind of the natives by any means but 
<lb/>a continually  pouring it upon them. And after all our chief 
<lb/>hope is in the young, but little comparatively can or has been 
<lb/>done with the old. You must not imagine from the style of 
<lb/>the foregoing remarks that I in the least disparage the labours 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000496_0004"/><!--pb/@n='77v'-->
<lb/>of the devoted bretheren who have long laboured amongst these people <unclear cert="low">the</unclear> it 
<lb/>has not been from any defect in their preaching that the unfortunate state 
<lb/>of the tribes immediately beyond us has resulted. It has been from the 
<lb/>want of means to carry on more extensive operations - their efforts 
<lb/>for want of more agents have been so much confined to one spot 
<lb/>occasionally visits have been made to the interior <choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut  for want of 
<lb/>others to supply their places at the station these attempts have been too 
<lb/>desultory in their nature to result in much good. It would 
<lb/>require many missionaries at different points in the country 
<lb/>before the great body of the people can be influenced,  this <unclear cert="low">defining</unclear>
<lb/>for want of labourers still exists and unless the society can send out 
<lb/>some more labourers there is only one <add place="above">other</add> hope left. I mean 
<lb/>the employment of native agents by private Christians at home<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>To ascertain if you can do anything at all for us in this respect 
<lb/>is my pbject in writing to you. I don't expect upi to publish 
<lb/>this though you were kind enough to request me to write so use 
<lb/>for that purpose. It is too full of inaccuracies for that. But 
<lb/>I hope you may find it convenient to do something with the <gap agent="illgblDel" extent="1" unit="words"/><w>inform-<lb break="no"/>ation</w> it contains - To shew the advantage of native agency amongst the 
<lb/>people <add place="above">I mention</add> a fact which every day stares me in the face. It has all along 
<lb/>beenthe practice of the Griqua town missionaries to employ native teachers 
<lb/>as soon as they were capable of doing anything in the work. This <del type="strikethrough">plan</del>
<lb/>plan was not thought advisable by the bretheren here, the consequence has been 
<lb/>the Griqua mission has augmented and stretched out on every 
<lb/>side <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> now they have more than 20 native agents, at work &amp; all 
<lb/>the people *<!-- asterisk with asterisked note in left margin - addspan?? The Griqua Town Mission has an immense number of <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> under instruction, many more <lb/>than this mission<reg>.</reg>--> on the <del type="strikethrough">three</del><add place="above">2 1/2</add> sides of Kuruman are under their instruction 
<lb/>viz. South &amp; S. East &amp; West <add place="above">&amp; some far to the North West</add> and the missionaries can now do little 
<lb/>else than <add place="above">itinerate &amp;</add> superintend them. We have an open door left for us 
<lb/>only towards the North. During the period of prosperity <del type="strikethrough">the</del> of the 
<lb/>G. Mission, this stood almost stock still <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>
<lb/>went to England, finding the current there strongly in favour of 
<lb/>native agency he appears to have changed his views a little for he  
<lb/>wrote back again instructing the bretheren here to make a trial 
<lb/>of two. These are stationed one at a village 16 miles off 
<lb/>northwards the other much farther to the North East &amp; now 
<lb/>although it is only a few years since they were appointed 
<lb/>each has many more members under him than on 
<lb/>the station here. And they are more consistent in their 
<lb/>walk and so kind to each other it is quite a treat to visit 
<lb/>them after living sometime with those here. The chief accessions 
<lb/>to the church have also been from their ministry, and 
<lb/>indeed this was to be expected for the truth seems to find its 
<lb/>way to the heart much sooner from their lips than 
<lb/>from a foreigner. In their hands it is divested of that 
<lb/>peculiar strangeness which always attaches to foreigners 
<lb/>in every country but more especially among the uncivilized<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>That native teachers have been planted amongst the tribes which 
<lb/>are now the avowed enemies of the gospel who only 

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000496_0005"/><!--pb/@n='78r'-->
<lb/>could have instructed the children <add place="above">to read</add> &amp; brought hoemt eh truths of the 
<lb/>Gospel repeated in their own simple affectionate way. We 
<lb/>might now have beheld a very different race of people, - at 
<lb/>present most of them would refuse a native teacher, I mean those 
<lb/>with 100 miles of us but not so with the tribes beyond<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>They would gladly receive them not however because the chiefs 
<lb/>love the gospel<reg>,</reg><choice><reg>o</reg><orig>O</orig></choice>f this they are entirely ignorant<reg>,</reg><choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut simply 
<lb/>because they imagine as yet that it would be a good thing 
<lb/>to have the whites as their friends &amp; it would add to their 
<lb/>importance a little. They are not yet contaminated by traders 
<lb/>Griquas &amp;c. But they soon will be if something is not 
<lb/><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="illgblDel"/> done for I found in <add place="above">each of</add> three tribes 2 persons who 
<lb/>had been infected with the <term type="ailment">venereal disease</term> from a Griqua 
<lb/>who lately visited them, O I wish much &amp; in this wish the 
<lb/>bretheren <persName>Hamilton</persName> &amp; <persName>Edwards</persName> cordially <del type="strikethrough">agr</del> join, that <del type="strikethrough">I</del>
<lb/>we could place some of our Christians amongst these people 
<lb/>that the blessings of Christianity &amp; civilization may be given 
<lb/>them before the further spread of some of the worst 
<w>accomp-<lb break="no"/>animents</w> of more refined society, there is enough of disease 
<lb/>amongst them already, many a sad case I saw without 
<lb/>the power of contributing effectually to the relief of the sufferer 
<lb/>on account of the shortness of our visit. I had no 
<lb/>idea previously that disease existed to such an extent in
<lb/>uncivilized life. At one small town I had about 40 really 
<lb/>bad cases brought to me, some scarcely able to crawl, the 
<lb/>chief himself was laid up of <term type="ailment">ophthalmia</term> &amp; some of the 
<lb/>cases in the houses were really the personifications of 
<lb/>abject misery. Some come great distances for my 
<lb/>medical advice, they fully appreciate the value of medicine 
<lb/>for bodily maladies<reg>.</reg> O that the Spirit may be poured out 
<lb/>upon them to make them value before it is too late the Great 
<lb/>Physician of souls. As it is however i could travel to 
<lb/>any distance in the character of a medical man &amp;be every 
<lb/>where well received, but in that capacity chiefly 
<lb/>they quite  
<lb/>beseiged my waggon when in the Interior, this liberty of 
<lb/>access I should be glad to employ for any friend who 
<lb/>should feel it his duty to employ a native teacher. If you 
<lb/>know anyone willing to contribute so much more than 
<lb/>they are already doing to the cause of Christ, I can assure 
<lb/>them they employ a most efficient mode of spreading 
<lb/>the gospel for during 
<lb/>the first few years of a 
<lb/>mission at least by teaching the children to read &amp; 
<lb/>preaching in their own way in which there are 
<lb/>imperfections, they do as much to remove prejudice 
<lb/>&amp; spread scriptural knowledge as can be effected by 
<lb/>any European. I know no better way of comme-

<lb/>ncing the work amongst thes people than this. Its efficiency 
<lb/>has been most abundantly testified both at <placeName>Griqua Town</placeName> &amp; here &amp; I may add too in the <placeName>South Sea islands</placeName>. I should 
<lb/>most gladly incur all the fatigue &amp; expense of taking them to 
<lb/>their destinations, help them afterwards as much as in my 
<lb/>faithful account of all that has been done - I don<reg>'</reg>t 
<lb/>know what more I could do but if anything more were needed 
<lb/>I should not I hope be wanting in my attentions to his or her wishes<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>These native teachers don<reg>'</reg>t engage in the work without sacrifice 
<lb/>£10 is by no means sufficient for the support of one in this 
<lb/>country but they take it thankfully &amp; some of them work 
<lb/>most assiduously. Usually they have to spend some <unclear cert="low">time</unclear>
<lb/>in hunting &amp;c. but at these times they employ another &amp; pay him for his labour. During these hunting excursions they 
<lb/>penetrate far into the country &amp; we have lately ascertained 
<lb/>they are not unmindful of their obligations even when far 
<lb/>removed beyond the reach of their teachers &amp; fellow Christians<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>They sometimes collect the natives of villages together &amp; tell them 
<lb/>of the way of life &amp; salvation by Jesus Christ<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>The country to the North abounds in game, the Lion, Elephant, 
<lb/>Rhinoceros, Giraffe<reg>,</reg> Zebra &amp; many kinds of antelope<reg>.</reg> But when 
<lb/>we come within the Tropics the heat is excessive, paricularly in the summer months at which period we visited it<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Water is scarce and it was only by follwoing the tracts of 
<lb/>the hunters to the different wells that we succeeded in 
<lb/>accomplishing our journey. There is a tribe called the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakalihari</term> who live quite with the desert, they have scarcely 
<lb/>any fountains, no cattle &amp; sunsist by snaring wild animals 
<lb/>and eating roots, Providence in a peculiar way supplies 
<lb/>the place of water to these sons of the desert. A species 
<lb/>of bitter melon grows abundantly on many parts of the 
<lb/>sandy plains which contains a considerable portion of sap. 
<lb/>There they collect &amp; making incisions into it bitter juice 
<lb/>exudes into their vessels &amp; by it they manage to quench 
<lb/>their thirst<choice><reg>.</reg><orig>,</orig></choice> It is a poor substitute <del type="strikethrough">for</del> But these 
<lb/>hardy fellows prize their liberty so much nothing 
<lb/>will induce them to quit what appears to us a miserable 
<lb/>mode of existance.<choice><reg>,</reg><orig>,</orig></choice> Probably they have, like the 
<lb/>Laplanders with their sowthistle &amp; smokers with their 
<lb/>tobacco <add place="above">become</add> so accustomed to their little melons they 
<lb/>taste sweetly to them. They are much afraid of the other <term type="tribe">Bechuananas</term>
<lb/>scarcely ever came to the waggons although our people ran after them 
<lb/>and invited them to come &amp; see the white people, they were afraid 

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000496_0007"/><!--pb/@n='79r'-->
<lb/>of being treated by us as they frequently are by their fellow <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>who frequently seize them &amp; reduce them to a kind of slavery</p>
<lb/><p><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Watt</persName> tells me the Glasgow churches are preparing clothing for the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>, these are good but unfortunately they always produce 
<lb/>heart burnings amongst the people. We can<reg>.'</reg>t give to all &amp; those who 
<lb/>don<reg>'</reg>t yet imagine we are partial &amp; have favourites. It is of great 
<lb/>importance for the missionary to appear as a universal friend. If I had 
<lb/>clothes publicly committed to my trust, to be distributed publicly I should 
<lb/>consider it a calamity, the only way to avoid the evil is to do all 
<lb/>privately &amp; never give without making them work some to make 
<lb/>them feel they have earned what they have got. When things are 
<lb/>given gratuitously it takes away all the feeling of independency 
<lb/>and teaches them to become beggars without shame. Lately some 
<lb/>boxes were sent and although all the <add place="above">female</add> members of the church now 
<lb/>appear in European gowns which look much neater than the 
<lb/>skin gowns their own manufacture, yet it has caused a 
<lb/>great deal of heart burning. Even the reigning chief a mean 
<lb/>speaking double faced dirty fellow, without honesty to appear 
<lb/>either on the side of the world or the Christians but conducts himself 
<lb/>one way with the one party &amp; another with the other, is grumbling

<lb/>The feeling in his mind is not to be wondered at, the Church has

<lb/>heinous indeed to justify so much abuse thrown on a
