<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>lake Nyassa</placeName>. 28 August</p>
<lb/><p rend="right">1866</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Tom</persName></p>
<lb/><p>We have had a long &amp; weary trudge from the 
<lb/>coast up to this and have been almost shut up from letting 
<lb/>our whereabouts be known. The Arab slave traders are 
<lb/>skidaddle as soon as they hear of our approach and away 
<lb/>they go scuttling through pathless forests. I entrusted one 
<lb/>letter about the sepoys to a chief to be given to a slave trader 
<lb/>for I had no hope of looking one in the face, and at the 
<lb/>time I gave it I had small hope of it ever reaching its 
<w>destina-<lb break="no"/>tion</w> for the fellows must conclude that they were bearing 
<lb/>no good news about themselves - I write however in 
<lb/>case I may light on one as I did on <persName>Seph Rubéa</persName> by accident 
<lb/>he heard that I was famishing and came forward like a 
<lb/>man and brother with an ox and big bag of flour. We had 
<lb/>just accomplished a march of eight days across a 
<w>depopu-<lb break="no"/>lated</w> tract of country and he with some 800 slaves was just 
<lb/>entering on it - I had made forced marches on the 6<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> &amp; 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day 
<lb/>to buuy food and send it back to the weaker bretheren - 
<lb/>all but four had given in, when this good samaritan slave 
<lb/>trader took the precaution of taking the bull by the horns. 
<lb/>"The English coming." "Why what can the christians want but 
<lb/>slaves", and off they all scamper. This dread of the English 
<lb/>has the disadvantage that I cannot get a dhow though there 
<lb/>are two on the Lake for fear that I should burn it.</p>
<lb/><p>The country is a gradual slope from the coast up to 
<lb/>within fidty miles of this shore. When with the influence 
<lb/>of the humidity of the Indian Ocean the forests are dense 
<lb/>to a painful degree - one could no more take bearings of 
<lb/>his position unless he were a baboon then if he tried to 
<lb/>use his instrument out of the bunghole of a hogshead. 
<lb/>Further up it is more often forest but still so thickly planted that one very seldom sees the horizon - at the 
<lb/>confluence of the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Loanda</placeName>  we came on a 
<lb/>tract of open country destitute of provisions and here the 
<lb/>sepoys entirely failed me - they had done their best to 
<lb/>kill the beasts of burden by way of forcing me to turn &amp; 
<lb/>they certainly succeeded in some instances - the tsetse 
<lb/>probably helped but the experiment was <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="hand"/>. The 
<lb/>sepoys were morally unfit for travel and then we had 
<lb/>hard lines all of us - food was not to be had for love or 
<lb/>money - our finest cloths only got morsels 
<lb/>of the common grain - I trudged it the whole way and having no animal food save what turtle doves 
<lb/>and guinea fowls we occasionally shot I became 
<lb/>like one of the Pharaoh's lean kine. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he last tramp 
<lb/>that referred to above brought us to a land of plenty<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002501_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>It was a very fine country but quite depopulatedf 
<lb/>I counted in one day<reg>'</reg>s march fifteen running burns 
<lb/>and this in the dry season. The country was then undulating 
<lb/>and mountainous - generally from 2000 to 3000 <add place="above">then 4000</add> feet 
<lb/>above the sea - cool &amp; pleasant. The people near the 
<lb/>coast are called Makonde - then Matambwe - then Makoa 
<lb/>thenWaiau or Waiyan - the Ajawa further south 
<lb/>and lastly the Manganja or Wanyassa here on the Lake<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>The principal chief names <persName>Mataka</persName> lives on the watershed 
<lb/>overlooking this but fifty miles or more distant 
<lb/>his town contained a thousand houses many of 
<lb/>them square in imitation of the Arabs. Large patches 
<lb/>of English peas in full bearing grew in the moist 
<lb/>hollows or were irrigated. Cattle shewed that no 
<lb/>Tsetse existed. When we arrived <persName>Mataka</persName> was just 
<lb/>sending back a number of cattle &amp; captives to their 
<lb/>own homes - they had been taken by his people without 
<lb/>his knowledge from <placeName>Nyassa</placeName>. I saw them by 
<lb/>accident there were 54 women and children - 
<lb/>about a dozen young men &amp; boys and about 25 or 
<lb/>30 head of cattle - as the act was spontaneous it 
<lb/>was all the more gratifying to witness - Frao  
<lb/><persName>Mataka's</persName> I sent the sepoys back - a more useless 
<lb/>lot I never saw. It was all against the grain that 
<lb/>they came, and they had such a sullen hangdog expression 
<lb/>of face the country people used to remark of them - "these 
<lb/>are the slaves of the party."</p>
<lb/><p>To come back to <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> was like visiting an old 
<lb/>home I never expected to see. The roar of the waves 
<lb/>and a dash in the breakers or rather rollers was quite 
<lb/>exhilerating. We get milk here and often fine 
<lb/>fresh fish very like herring in taste &amp; appearance<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>These are putting flesh on our bones. Where 
<lb/><persName><unclear cert="low">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rosder</unclear></persName> came I cannot make out - Nobody 
<lb/>knew him as a European and no one knows 
<lb/>his name. I believe he travelled as an Arab. 
<lb/>I have to stand a deal of staring as the first English 
<lb/>man they ever saw but a poodle dog is as popular 
<lb/>as anyone. His appearance is so terrific to the 
<lb/>country curs that they flee from him as if he were 
<lb/>a lion and he chases them as if he believed the 
<lb/>same thing of himself - I think his fierce appearance 
<lb/>arises from it being difficult to decide at 
<lb/>which end his tail lies - the rest of my party 
<lb/>do pretty well<reg>.</reg></p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002501_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><p>I sometimes remember you with some anxiety 
<lb/>as not knowing what opening may be made 
<lb/>for you in life. The Dear of ely - th <persName>Rev Harvey 
<lb/>Goodwin</persName>said to me that he might be able to do some 
<lb/>thing to help forward the education of my children. 
<lb/>The church of England people have much in their 
<lb/>power - It is a rich establishment, and they have 
<lb/>scarcely a vestige in Scotland - they have presentations 
<lb/>to schools and colleges which provide for young 
<lb/>men of ability, and open up higher situations - though 
<lb/>I do not know how your tendencies be I wrote to 
<lb/><persName>Professor Sedgwick</persName> to put the Dean in mind of 
<lb/>his kind intentions - the letter will go with this 
<lb/>and I should write to <persName>D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Buchanan</persName> or <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Young</persName>
<lb/>you will have madde up your mind what to 
<lb/>answer. They require very thorough scholarship, 
<lb/>and I have no doubt but you are working for 
<lb/>that will <unclear cert="low">a will</unclear>. If you incline to the mercantile line 
<lb/>you will require to be a year or two in a merchants 
<lb/>office in London, but whatever you feel yourself best 
<lb/>fitted for "Commit thy way unto the Lond: Trust also in him 
<lb/>and he will bring it to pass." One ought to endevour to devote 
<lb/>the peculiarites of his nature to his Redeemer's service whatever 
<lb/>these may be. Many make mistakes, as for instance a person 
<lb/>of a solid practical turn of mind &amp; body, looking to a minister of a 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">fervid</unclear> impulsive nature as his model - and aspiring to that 
<lb/>for which he was never intended - <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Young </persName> you will find a  
<lb/>good counsellor and a warm friend - you can scarcely go 
<lb/>wrong with his advice.It would be wise to visit them as 
<lb/>often as convenient. <persName>Captain Sherard Obborne</persName> said to me 
<lb/>that he could assist you in his line that is get you a situation 
<lb/>in an Indian Railway - they are well paid but you could 
<lb/>look to that only if you enetered on it. I said that I would tell you<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Let nothing come between your work of mental preparation 
<lb/>for the present.</p>
<lb/><p>1<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">st</hi></hi> Feb<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 1867 at <placeName>Bemba</placeName> about 10º 10′ Lat S. &amp; 31º 50′ East 
<lb/>for we came but yesterday. We crossed <placeName>Loangwa R</placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>then had a long wet hungry march through to <term type="tribe">Babisa</term>
<lb/>country to cross <placeName>Chambeze</placeName> as <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> is there called in 
<lb/>10º 34′ South. The <term type="tribe">Babisa</term> are great slave traders and have 
<lb/>reaped its fruits in a miserable destitute depopulated 
<lb/>country. It is one great forest with mountain &amp; flood 
<lb/>very fine to look at but toilsome - dripping with 
<lb/>showers every day - small patches of millet at wide 
<lb/>intervals &amp; scanty population who have nothing to sell<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002501_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>Mushrooms in plenty in the dark forests but a little millet 
<lb/>porridge &amp; mushrooms - woe is me - good enough to produce 
<lb/>fine dreams of the Roast beef of Old England but nothing else<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have become very thin - though I was so but now 
<lb/>if you weighed me you might calculate very easily how much 
<lb/>you might get for the bones only but I take on flesh very easily &amp; 
<lb/>we got a cow yesterday &amp; I am to get milk tomoroow &amp; will want 
<lb/>a little with the chief <persName>Chitapangowa</persName> a good fellow so far as we have seen him. I am on the watershed I think at last about 4500 ft 
<lb/>above the sea. We crossed one range 6600 feet &amp; then a spot where 
<lb/>I grieve to write it poor Poodle "Chitane" was drowned. We had 
<lb/>to cross a marsh a mile wide &amp; waist deep - bottom soft peaty 
<lb/>stuff in which one did well enough but deep holes made by buffaloes 
<lb/>feet caused us flounder. I went over first &amp; forgot to give orders about 
<lb/>the dog - all were too much engaged in keeping his balance to notice 
<lb/>that he swam among them till he died. He had more spunk than a 
<lb/>hundred country dogs, took charge of the whole line of march - ran to 
<lb/>see the first in the line then back to the last &amp; barked to haul him up 
<lb/>then when he knew what hut I occupied would not let a 
<lb/>country one come in sight of it &amp; never stole himself. He was 
<lb/>becoming yellowish red like the country dogs - and he shared 
<lb/>the starving with me. We have not had any difficulties 
<lb/>with the people made many friends - imparted a litle 
<lb/>knowledge sometimes and raised a protest against slaving 
<lb/>very widely - some will remember what was said &amp; at all 
<lb/>events a beginning was made. Some black slaves from 
<lb/>the Coast were found here - their first visit - but they go off 
<lb/>tomorrow &amp; try the experiment of sending letters - a few half 
<lb/>ready in ones &amp; hope they may reach you. The rains hold us 
<lb/>back but we hope to be at our second supply of goods 
<lb/>at <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> by May not a line has come to me 
<lb/>from the coast so I am as ill off for news of you as you 
<lb/>may be of me. I have but nine African boys with me 
<lb/>the Johanna men ran back in sheer terror of the <term type="tribe">Mazitu</term> or 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Zulus</term>. In fact did that at the South end of the Lake which I 
<lb/>feared would occur at the North end, but we have fewer 
<lb/>mouths to fill &amp; when we are in a game country I generally 
<lb/>secure a beast. My love to <persName>Agnes</persName><reg>,</reg><persName>Oswell</persName> &amp;the <unclear cert="low">Anties</unclear> with 
<lb/><persName>Anna Mary</persName> - the Lord bless &amp; keep you all. I expect letters 
<lb/>at <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName>. You must send love to <persName>John</persName> &amp; family 
<lb/>in America &amp; also to <persName>Charles</persName> for I cannot write them 
<lb/>at present<reg>.</reg></p>
