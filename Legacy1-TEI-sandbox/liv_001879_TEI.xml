<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Elephant Marsh</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">12 Feby 1863 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Waller</persName></p>
<lb/><p><persName>Johnstone</persName> passed us on 
<lb/>28<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Alt with the melancholy intelligence 
<lb/>that our poor dear <persName>Scudamore</persName> had been 
<lb/>taken from us. We have had one blow 
<lb/>after another and did we not believe 
<lb/>in the special Providence of Him who 
<lb/>doeth all things well we might dispair 
<lb/>but so it was on the West Coast 
<lb/>I trust here these sad experiences 
<lb/>may be followed with similar 
<lb/>successes. I fear that living in the 
<lb/>lowlands as you have been forced 
<lb/>to do by vile slavehunting 
<w>com-<lb break="no"/>plications</w> may result in worse. 
<lb/>We have a bad case on board in 
<lb/><persName>Wilson</persName> the stoker who is quite jaundiced 
<lb/>and here we must stay victimized 
<lb/>by the deep drought of Pioneer - four 
<lb/>feet in front of us now is a poor 
<lb/>look out. Even Lady Nyassa draws 
<lb/>within 2 inches of four feet. We came 
<lb/>up easily till we got to the sudden 
<lb/>bends of the river beyond <placeName>Ruo</placeName> and 
<lb/>then with two ships it was trying 
<lb/>work. No mortal man can realize 
<lb/>the bother and worry one has to put 
<lb/>up with if he means to do good in his

<lb/>day &amp; generation - but I need not inflict 
<lb/>any of it on you. </p>
<lb/><p>Between ourselves <persName>Earl Russell</persName> gave 
<lb/>me a warm touch of approbation 
<lb/>for our doings when last up and 
<lb/>sent orders to our minister at 
<lb/><placeName>Lisbon</placeName> to make a strong representation 
<lb/>to the Portuguese Government about 
<lb/>the deeds of the Tettites. I have been 
<lb/>following up my former statements 
<lb/>by giving an account of the sad 
<lb/>depopulation that has gone on by 
<lb/>means of Mariamo - Belshore &amp;c &amp;c 
<lb/>We have counted 31 bodies floating 
<lb/>down - and I have taken good care 
<lb/>to point out to <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName>
<lb/>the causes of the failure of his policy 
<lb/>on the East coast which has been 
<lb/>so triumphant on the West 20 
<lb/>missions established 20 dialects reduced 
<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c lawful commerce from 
<lb/>20 000 to between £2 000 000 V £ 
<lb/>000 000, while here it is still the old 
<lb/>paltry peddling in ivory &amp; gold dust and 
<lb/>the only mission attempted struggling 
<lb/>against strangulation by slave hunters 
<lb/>backed by Portuguese Governors. It 
<lb/>would have been so on the West had 
<lb/>only a few convert Portuguese been 
<lb/>admitted to the interior. I trust that

<lb/>by the blessing of the Highest this may lead 
<lb/>to an alteration of policy, but this of course 
<lb/>is only among ourselves to be talked of 
<lb/>for the present. A canoe load of 
<lb/>ammunition wines &amp;c for Mariamo 
<lb/>was caught up at the mouth of the <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>coming up in name of the Mission 
<lb/>Oh the scamps! And His Excellency of 
<lb/>Quilliamane has been writing to the 
<lb/>other of <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> saying that 
<lb/>so much merchandise as powder 
<lb/>arms &amp; calicoes are introduced for 
<lb/>the scientific &amp; exploring Expeditions 
<lb/>under <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> L</persName> and <persName>bishop M</persName>. That the 
<lb/>commerce of the country is injured 
<lb/>it is likely that the <persName>Governor of Q</persName> is 
<lb/>contriving at the supplies of Mariamo 
<lb/>and trying to divert attention elsewhere 
<lb/>It will all come out right at last 
<lb/>you have lots of provisions coming 
<lb/>I towed them over <placeName>Quillimane</placeName> bar 
<lb/>for you in <persName>Col Nunes</persName> launch which 
<lb/>was leaky and I fear may have 
<lb/>damaged some things. We took them 
<lb/>out of the "Rapid" a new cruizer 
<lb/>that thrust them into the launch &amp; 
<lb/>set sail. We had to remain out all 
<lb/>night. As soon as we saw her 
<lb/>to be leaky we took the good &amp; aboard 
<lb/>though crowded with cattle &amp; full of 
<lb/>provisions<reg>.</reg>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001879_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>Had it began to blow we must have thrown 
<lb/>them &amp; the oxen over. We put them in again 
<lb/>next day in the River but the slaves 
<lb/>probably did not bale as we hear of 
<lb/>damage done more than was when 
<lb/>we had them - the nail - a large one I 
<lb/>sent up to <placeName>Quillimane</placeName> - thinking it 
<lb/>would go quicker that way. Nyassa 
<lb/>failed us miserably - promised to sail 
<lb/>down for the goods and never knowing 
<lb/>him to lie before I advised <persName>Proctor</persName>
<lb/>just to leave the affair in his hands 
<lb/>He did not send - and time was lost 
<lb/>thereby. Lots of medical comforts 
<lb/>coming &amp; one cask of brandy. As 
<lb/>for ourselves we took as much 
<lb/>provisions from Johanna as we 
<lb/>could but we shall be out in June 
<lb/>so must go back. Forty mouths 
<lb/>eating and not an ounce coming 
<lb/>in. We had eight months stores and 
<lb/>must go back for eight more as 
<lb/>so as we can get Nyassa up. </p>
<lb/><p>I thought you were wrong in attacking the 
<lb/>Ajowa till I looked on it as defence 
<lb/>of your poor orphans. I thought that 
<lb/>you had shut yourselves up to one 
<lb/>tribe and that the Manganja but 
<lb/>I think differently now &amp; only wish 
<lb/>they would send out <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Pusey</persName> here 
<lb/>he would learn a little sense of
