<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="5"/><space unit="chars" extent="4"/>I wrote you some months ago <del type="cancelled">but</del>
<lb/>but was <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>favoured with the <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>means of transmission only 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">last</del> <add place="above">two</add> weeks ago. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>We are <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>famishing for want of <bibl>news</bibl> from 
<lb/><placeName><region>the South</region></placeName> having had no arrivals from <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> for 
<lb/>many months, <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>and as the next best to <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">myself</add> I begin

<lb/>to listen for months to the <bibl>news</bibl> of this dark region 
<lb/>without anything to turn our thoughts away to the world 
<lb/>of light &amp; civilization. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>After the first two sentences 
<lb/>were penned an instance of what we have to listen 
<lb/>to perpetually occurred in the arrival of two <term type="occupation">messengers</term> 
<lb/>from a <term type="occupation">chief</term> concerning his gun, somebody is 
<lb/><term type="occupation">tailor</term> to <term type="occupation">her Majesty</term> But I am <term type="occupation">gun <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>mender</term> to all - the 
<lb/>tribes <del type="strikethrough">no</del> &amp; their <term type="occupation">sovereign</term> <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. The 
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term> of the <term type="tribe">Bamangueto</term> sent all the way here for 
<lb/>assistance in that particular, and I am sure 
<lb/>you would smile if you heard the supplicating 
<lb/>tone assumed by that as well as other potentates 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>when their guns are "dead" <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>And the authoritative 
<lb/>tone I assume in threatening to withold any aid if 
<lb/>one drop of human blood is ever shed by fire arms
<lb/>In <persName>Sekhomi</persName>'s case I threaten if he attacks the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakaas</term> (As he recently attempted to do) I shall not 
<lb/>only refuse aid but prevent <orgName>white men</orgName> <w>sell-
<lb break="no"/>-ing</w> guns to him <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>for all time to come. As they 
<lb/>are aware <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>we <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>possess some influence with <orgName>our 
<lb/>countrymen</orgName> - these threats make them almost turn 
<lb/>pale lest we put them into execution. I think 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>I told you in my last <supplied cert="high">letter</supplied> that <persName>Sechele</persName> the <term type="occupation">chief</term> 
<lb/>to whom we have transferred our more stated 
<lb/>labours refrained from attacking the <orgName>murderers</orgName> 
<lb/>of his father "because he would <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>not break 
<lb/>his promise to his <term type="occupation">missionary</term>" <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>We had recently 
<lb/>at <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName> a number of visitors from a

<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Toolah</term> or <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> race and came
