<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="12"/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> June 1843</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="chars" extent="3"/>My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="4"/><space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> your most welcome &amp; long expected <bibl>letter</bibl> a few days 
<lb/>ago, and I assure you my heart was made white by its perusal. I am 
<lb/>glad you have at length arrived at a sphere of labour &amp; that there is a 
<lb/>prospect of your labour being crowned with success. May you have 
<lb/>an unction from the Holy one that <choice><sic>magny</sic><corr>many</corr></choice> sinners may through your 
<lb/>instrumentality be baptized with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven
<lb/>But while I am glad to hear of your prospects I feel sorry that you 
<lb/>have some <del type="cancelled"><gap agent="illegible" extent="1" unit="words"/>/&gt;</del> pain in that you are not enjoying the full cooperation <!-- Adrian, for some reason this del tag with "cancelled" isn't working properly - how fix? HB -->
<lb/>of your dear partner in life. The debility of which you spoke 
<lb/>I hope however is by this time removed and you may now be 
<lb/>both vigourously prosecuting the great work for which we have 
<lb/>been sent to the <orgName>Heathen</orgName>. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I am not going to give you medical 
<lb/>advice at such a distance but you could easily manufacture 
<lb/>a shower bath which if used when you are <term type="ailment">not sensible 
<lb/>of either chill or fatigue</term> I have no doubt would benefit you 
<lb/>both. You must present my <term type="faith">Christian</term> Love to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>D</abbr><expan>Drummond</expan></choice></persName> &amp;
<lb/>her little <persName>Jean</persName>. I mention it now lest as I am still this old 
<lb/><choice><sic>batchelor</sic><corr>bachelor</corr></choice> I should forget it at the end. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/><persName>Ingles</persName> is married &amp; 
<lb/>now on his way up here, so is <persName>Moore</persName> &amp; now on his way 
<lb/>to your quarter. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/><persName>Prentice</persName> is married to <persName>Catrine</persName> &amp; has a child 
<lb/>I believe he got her because he intended to be a <term type="occupation">missionary</term> 
<lb/>now he is stuck up in his <choice><sic>fathers</sic><corr>father's</corr></choice> <orgName>counting house</orgName> at <!-- Not sure if counting house is like custom house, which I believe we tag? HB -->
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Stowmarket</settlement></placeName> &amp; <persName>John <unclear cert="medium">Hay</unclear></persName> is expected home to be noosed to 
<lb/><persName>Lucy</persName>. Thus you see the world goes on and all my good 
<lb/>example is lost upon it. <foreign xml:lang="la">O Tempores O mores</foreign>! You 
<lb/>thought I should turn foolish at <placeName><region>the Cape</region></placeName> What nonsense 
<lb/>man <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>Do you think I would take a thing in hand &amp; 
<lb/>not carry it through <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>But I suppose I must give in 
<lb/>directly for I shall get a few of the wise sayings of
<lb/><persName>Magregor</persName> before long.</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="2"/><space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I am happy to hear you are succeeding with the  
<lb/>language. I had to speak long before I knew what to 
<lb/>say. <term type="ailment">Colics</term> came in by dozens &amp; <term type="ailment">sore bellies</term> by the score &amp;
<lb/>if I did not help them they were sure to help me. I then 
<lb/>set off <choice><abbr>N</abbr><expan>North</expan></choice> left all <orgName>European</orgName> Society, went far north 
<lb/>&amp; beyond every other <orgName>white man</orgName> in order to learn the 
<lb/>different dialects of the language, the latter I partially 
<lb/>effected &amp; now I can speak so as to be understood 
<lb/>by any of them. The language of the other tribe however is 
<lb/>that in which I am most expert, I can preach
<lb/>in it with nearly the same ease as I can speak 
<lb/>English But still I have something to learn, I can not 
<lb/>apply all the words I know at the exact time when 
<lb/>I wish to <add place="above">use</add> <del type="strikethrough">have</del> them. By the above course I have 
<lb/>been made acquainted with the customs &amp; modes of thinking 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000526_0002"/><!--pb/@n='14v'-->
<lb/>of <orgName>the people</orgName> better than if I had remained as one station, and 
<lb/>there being but a very slender assistance to be to be derived from the 
<lb/>language used in <bibl>the testament</bibl> the above course was absolutely 
<lb/>necessary. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>During my first visit to <placeName><region>the Interior</region></placeName> I went as 
<lb/>far <choice><sic>as</sic><corr/></choice> North East as far as <choice><abbr>Lat</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice> 22ยบ <choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice> <choice><abbr>Long</abbr><expan>Longitude</expan></choice> 29ยบ <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice> &amp; visited many 
<lb/>tribes who had never before seen a white face. By 
<lb/>means of <orgName><orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term></orgName> with me I was enabled in a poor 
<lb/><del type="cancelled"><gap agent="illegible" extent="2" unit="chars"/>/&gt;</del> way to proclaim the message of mercy. That tour <!-- Same for this del tag as above. HB -->
<lb/>lasted 4 months &amp; now I am just returned from another 
<lb/>of a like duration, <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>But this is a weary wide wide
<lb/>country &amp; <orgName>the people</orgName> are scattered over it at immense
<lb/>distances from each other. I could give you many 
<lb/>anecdotes of wild beasts if you were a lover of such 
<lb/>stuff but as I know you are not I would fain 
<lb/>give you something more profitable. I have not been 
<lb/>allowed to attempt anything of a permanent nature in 
<lb/>consequence of an <bibl>interdict of the <term type="occupation">Directors</term></bibl>, they forbade
<lb/>information of any new station <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> the <orgName>whole 
<lb/>mission</orgName> should be organized, this organization was 
<lb/>to take place after the arrival of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> &amp; the 
<lb/>other <choice><sic>bretheren</sic><corr>brethren</corr></choice> &amp; means simply, a <orgName>committee</orgName> is to
<lb/>be got up by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> in opposition to the former 
<lb/>state of things by <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phillip</persName>. A <orgName>committee</orgName> it is to be 
<lb/>alias a <orgName><choice><sic>presbetery</sic><corr>presbytery</corr></choice></orgName>. <choice><sic>this</sic><corr>This</corr></choice> is as much against the grain 
<lb/>with me as the <orgName><choice><sic>bishoprick</sic><corr>bishopric</corr></choice></orgName> is. But if it will advance 
<lb/>the cause I <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> spend time quarelling. I have not 
<lb/>the least confidence in the wisdom either collective or 
<lb/>individual of our <orgName><term type="nationality"><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice> African</term> <choice><sic>bretheren</sic><corr>brethren</corr></choice></orgName>. There has been 
<lb/>too much <unclear cert="medium">jarring</unclear> &amp; now a <orgName>committee</orgName> the result of a <unclear cert="medium">jar</unclear>
<lb/>It does not bode well. I shall give it the go by if I 
<lb/>see nonsense springing up. O that none of my life 
<lb/>may be spent in vain <unclear cert="low">jangling</unclear> after I have had 
<lb/>such an opportunity of devoting it to him who 
<lb/>died to save me.</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="words" extent="1"/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/><orgName>This mission</orgName> has been pretty successful among
