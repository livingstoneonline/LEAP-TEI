<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Ujiji</placeName> - 30<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> May 1869 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear <persName>Col. Playfair</persName> or <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his note goes by Musa 
<lb/>Kamaals who was employed 
<lb/>by Karoji to drive the buffaloes 
<lb/>hither, but by <add place="above">over</add> driving them 
<w>un-<lb break="no"/>mercifully</w> in the sun &amp; tying them 
<lb/>up to save trouble in herding 
<lb/>they all died before he got to <placeName><w>Unyin-<lb break="no"/>yembe.</w></placeName> He witnessed the plunder
<lb/>ing of my goods 
&amp; got a share of 
<lb/>them. I have given him beads 
<lb/>and cloth sufficient to buy 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>visions</w> for himself in the way 
<lb/>back to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName>. He has done 
<lb/>nothing here. He neither went 
<lb/>near the goods here nor tried to 
<lb/>prevent them being stolen in the 
<lb/>way. I suppose that pay for 
<lb/>four months in coming - other 
<lb/>four of rest - and four in going 
<lb/>back would be ample <del type="strikethrough">pay</del>
<lb/>but I leave this to your decision<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I could not employ him to 
<lb/>carry my mail back, nor can 
<lb/>I say anything to him for he 
<lb/>at once goes to the Ujijians 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002538_0002"/><!--pb/@n='35v'-->
<lb/>and gives his own version of all 
<lb/>he hears. He <add place="above">is</add> untruthful and 
<w>ill-<lb break="no"/>conditioned</w> and would hand off 
<lb/>the mail to anyone who wished to 
<lb/>destroy it. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he people here are like 
<lb/>the Kilwa traders <del type="strikethrough">from Kilwa</del>
<lb/>haters of the English. Those <add place="above"><placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> men</add> whom 
<lb/>I met between this &amp; <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> were 
<lb/>gentlemen and traded with honour<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Here as in the haunts of the Kilwa 
<lb/>hordes slaving is a series of 
<lb/>forays - and they dread exposure 
<lb/>by my letters - no one will take 
<lb/>charge of them - I have got <persName>Thani 
<lb/>bin Suellim</persName> to take a mail <add place="above">privately</add> for 
<lb/>transmission to <placeName>Uny<add place="above">any</add>ambe</placeName> - <!-- TODO SM: addition in other hand needs to be coded properly --> It 
<lb/>contains a cheque on Ritchie 
<lb/>Steuart &amp;co of <placeName>Bombay</placeName> for 
<lb/>Rs 2000 - and some forty letters 
<lb/>written during my slow recovery. 
<lb/>I fear it may never reach you<reg>.</reg> A party was sent to the coast two 
<lb/>months ago. One man volunteered 
<lb/>to take a letter secretly, but his master 
<lb/>warned them all not to do so, 
<lb/>"because I might write something 
<lb/>he did not like." He went out 
<lb/>with the party &amp; gave orders to 
<lb/>the headman to destroy any letter 
<lb/>he might detect in the way. 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002538_0003"/><!--pb/@n='36r'-->
<lb/>This, though I am good friends 
<lb/>outwardly with them all. I 
<lb/>can get no assistance in 
<w>Pro-<lb break="no"/>curing</w> carriers and as you will 
<lb/>see if the mail comes to hand. 
<lb/>I send to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> for fifteen 
<lb/>good boatmen to act as carriers 
<lb/>if required - 80 pieces of 
<lb/>Merikans 40 d<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Kinike 
<lb/>12 Frasilas of the beads called 
<lb/>Samsam - shoes &amp;c and 
<lb/>I have written to Sayad Majid 
<lb/>begging two of his <choice><sic>gaurd</sic><corr>guard</corr></choice> to 
<lb/>see to the safety of the goods 
<lb/>here into <persName>Thani bin Suellim<reg>'</reg>s</persName>
<lb/>hands or into those of <persName>Muhamad bin Saleh</persName>. </p>
<lb/><p>As to the work to be done 
<lb/>by me it is only to connect 
<lb/>the sources which I have 
<lb/>discovered from 500 to 700 
<lb/>miles south of Speke and 
<lb/>Baker's <add place="above">with their <placeName>Nile</placeName></add>. The volume of 
<lb/>water which flows North from Lat. 12ยบ South is <gap extent="3" unit="lines" agent="damage"/>

<lb/>those of the <placeName>Nile</placeName>. I have to go 
<lb/>down the Eastern Line of 
<lb/>drainage to Baker's turning 
<lb/>point. <placeName>Tanganyika</placeName> - Nzige - 
<lb/>Chowambe (Baker's?) are 
<lb/>one water - and the head of it 
<lb/>is 300 miles south of this. 
<lb/><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Western &amp; central lines of 
<lb/>drainage converge into an 
<w>un-<lb break="no"/>visited</w> Lake West or SW of 
<lb/>this. The outflow of this whether 
<lb/>to <placeName>Congo</placeName> or <placeName>Nile</placeName> I have 
<w>to-<lb break="no"/>ascertain.</w><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he people West of 
<lb/>this called <term type="tribe">Menyema</term> are cannibals if Arabs speak truly<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I may have to go there first 
<lb/>and down <placeName>Tanganyike</placeName> if 
<lb/>I come out uneaten &amp; find 
<lb/>my new squad from <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName><reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I ernestly hope that you will
