<lb/>relates more immediately to my own efforts in that cause I shall 
<lb/>give you some account of <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>my recent tour into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent"><space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I left on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> <choice><abbr>Feb.</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice> last &amp; returned a few days ago, Part 
<lb/>of this journey was in my waggon &amp; about 400 miles of 
<lb/>it on a <term type="animal">pack ox</term>. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>It was very warm in that country <!-- geog: the Interior -->
<lb/>I was exposed to some dangers but have much reason 
<lb/>to be grateful to Him who preserved my health &amp; 
<lb/>rescued me <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>from every danger. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>I had many <w>opportun<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>ities</w> of preaching <bibl>the gospel</bibl>, &amp; frequently to those who had 
<lb/>never before heard the voice or seen the face of a 
<lb/><orgName>European</orgName>. <space unit="chars" extent="3"/>My first stage was 10 days from this 
<lb/>&amp; at the village where <persName>Sebegoe</persName> with the <orgName>remains of his 
<lb/>tribe</orgName> have taken up his abode. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I related to you the 
<lb/>sad doings of <persName>Mahura</persName> among that tribe <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>. <orgName>Some of our <!-- term: Sebegoe's tribe -->
<lb/>people</orgName> having been there (with <persName><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>Sebegoe</expan></choice></persName>) at the time of attack 
<lb/>&amp; under <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">in</add> circumstances which could not fail to 
<lb/>excite the minds of the <orgName>Heathen</orgName> against <bibl>the gospel</bibl> I <add place="marginright">therefore</add>
<lb/>felt most <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>anxious to go &amp; by my explanations &amp; 
<lb/>presence endeavour to eradicate their prejudices. <choice><orig>that</orig><reg>That</reg></choice> 
<lb/>you may understand what the feelings of the <orgName>heathen</orgName> were 
<lb/>in reference to <orgName>our people</orgName> I may mention that they 
<lb/>having accidentally fired a gun the night previous to the 
<lb/>attack, it was considered by <orgName><persName><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>Sebegoe</expan></choice></persName>'s people</orgName> as having been the 
<lb/>signal by which to apprise <persName>Mahura</persName> of the situation in which 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Wanketze</term> stood. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/><choice><orig>the</orig><reg>The</reg></choice> singing at family worship their 
<lb/>incantations to <choice><sic>insure</sic><corr>ensure</corr></choice> success in the <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above"><del type="strikethrough">the</del> attack of</add> next morning &amp; 
<lb/>the collecting them together on sunday mornning for worship 
<lb/>as no other than a pretext to get them more easily <w>slaughter<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>ed</w>. On account of these circumstances we felt much 
<lb/>grieved, &amp; earnestly longed for an opportunity to disabuse their 
<lb/>minds But <persName><choice><abbr>S</abbr><expan>Sebegoe</expan></choice></persName> could get no one to go out with me, some who 
<lb/>thought I might ask them immediately absconded for the dread 
<lb/>of certain death was on every mind when they thought on the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>
<lb/>By the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of <choice><abbr>Feb</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice> however I prevailed on three to accompany 
<lb/>me. But a more craven hearted set never ate <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term>, one of 
<lb/>them was with the <orgName>party of believers</orgName> who visited <persName>Sebegoe</persName> previous 
<lb/>to the attack. We unyoked outside his village &amp; fearing to leave their

<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>nised</w> by the <term type="tribe">Wanketze</term> (apart from myself) I said come along Let us 
<lb/>go to the <term type="occupation">king</term>. He seemed reluctant enough but followed. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>When we 
<lb/>came to the place where <persName>Sebegwe</persName> was seated on the ground I squatted 
<lb/>down beside him. His <term type="occupation">warriors</term> immediately recognized my <term type="occupation">servant</term>
<lb/>&amp; neither words nor looks betokened any complacency towards him. <choice><orig>the</orig><reg>The</reg></choice> 
<lb/>poor fellow looked 'unutterable things' and as soon as the uproarious 
<lb/>recognition was over <space unit="chars" extent="2"/><persName>Sebegwe</persName> turned to me &amp; demanded Why I 
<lb/>had attacked him, destroyed all <orgName>his people</orgName>, &amp; stolen his <term type="animal">cattle</term>. I in turn 
<lb/>demanded why he had refused to the advice I tendered him by the <term type="occupation"><w>messen<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>gers</w></term> by whom he sent me an <term type="animal">ox</term> <add place="above">&amp; thus destroy himself</add> not <del type="cancelled">to</del> leave the <placeName>Bakalihari desert</placeName>. 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="2"/>Did the <term type="occupation">messengers</term> fail to deliver <bibl>my message</bibl> or did he discredit my 
<lb/>words . <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>I told him I had said to his <term type="occupation">messenger</term> that if <persName>Sebegwe</persName> left 
<lb/>that country <persName>Mahura</persName> would certainly attack him. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>He answered 
<lb/>the <term type="occupation">messengers</term> told him all. But his heart sore longed again to eat 
<lb/><term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> <term type="ailment">fevers</term> had destroyed <orgName>many of his people</orgName> while his <term type="animal">oxen</term> had 
<lb/>increased so much he could not get them taken care of. He 
<lb/>did not discredit my words but was induced to leave that country 
<lb/>by the <unclear cert="low">unportunities</unclear> of <orgName>his people</orgName>. &amp; not knowing the power of guns 
<lb/>he dispersed the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term>. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>Poor man he now knows it to his cost
<lb/>May these afflictions be blessed to his soul. <choice><orig>some</orig><reg>Some</reg></choice> of the <term type="occupation">messengers</term>
<lb/>who came to me last year still survive &amp; recognized me. <persName>Sebegwe</persName>
<lb/>&amp; I soon became very good friends. <space unit="chars" extent="3"/>The day following that 
<lb/>on which I arrived being Sabbath I was pleased to hear before <w>day<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>light</w> the <term type="occupation"><term type="occupation"><choice><sic>kings</sic><corr>king's</corr></choice></term> herald</term> proclaiming from an emminence "that no 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>work must be done on that day. We must do nothing but pray 
<lb/>to God &amp; listen to the words of the <orgName>foreigner</orgName>, all must come to 
<lb/>hear, <persName>Sebegwe</persName> will not suffer anyone to remain behind<supplied>"</supplied>. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>This 
<lb/>was by way of honouring me I having explained to him the day before 
<lb/>the nature of our Sabbath. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/><orgName>His people</orgName> were all entirely ignorant 
<lb/>of God. He was seen by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> once, But does not 
<lb/>remember anything that was then preached to him. It is probable 
<lb/>as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> was then young &amp; did not understand the language the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Wanketezi</term> did not understand what was preached. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>The comet 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> <choice><abbr>P.</abbr><expan>Pyne</expan></choice></persName> averted to in hers of <choice><sic>december</sic><corr>December</corr></choice> last, we saw in 
<lb/>the month of <choice><sic>march</sic><corr>March</corr></choice>. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>It was a glorious sight But inspired 
<lb/>all <orgName>the inhabitants of <placeName><region>the Interior</region></placeName></orgName> with terror. The <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> thought 
<lb/>that <persName>Sebegwe</persName> had brought it in order to kill them for their 
<lb/>attack upon him, &amp; <persName>Sebegwe</persName> asked me if <persName>Mahura</persName> was dead 
<lb/>as he thought the comet was the signal of that event</p>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">I visited <term type="tribe">the Bakhatla</term>, the <term type="occupation">chief</term> of that tribe fled into the desert <!-- geog: Bakalihari desert -->
<lb/>with <persName>Sebegwe</persName> &amp; has just now returned to his own land. He was 
<lb/>particularly friendly to us, I asked him if he should like me 
<lb/>to come &amp; live with him He held up his hands &amp; exclaimed <reg>"</reg>O I shall 
<lb/>dance if you say you will come<reg>"</reg>, I asked if he would give 
<lb/>me a garden, they have no idea of selling land. Wherever 
<lb/>one chooses to plough that is his land. We however have 
<lb/>to make a bargain in order to have a permanent property near 
<lb/>their villages over which the <term type="occupation">king</term> has no power He said 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000532_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><reg>"</reg>I shall call all <orgName>your people</orgName> to <del type="strikethrough">plow</del> <add place="above">hoe</add> for you , &amp; you shall have more

<lb/>you. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>It is probable <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> &amp; myself will go &amp; settle with 
<lb/>him soon. <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>But I must go on to the rest of my journey. 
<lb/>I visited the <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> again but the recent commotions 
<lb/>have quite <del type="cancelled"><gap agent="illegible" extent="1" unit="words"/></del> changed all the former state of things. No 
<lb/>one now lives <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>where he formerly resided. <persName>Bubi</persName> has fled from 
<lb/>the spot where we led out <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>the <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>water last year, <persName>Sechele</persName> has 
<lb/>come southwards, <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>The <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> have fled into the holes 
<lb/>of the rocks &amp; live like the <term type="tribe">Bakua</term> &amp; <term type="tribe">Bamakalaka</term>, <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>many of 
<lb/><orgName><persName>Sebegwe</persName>'s women</orgName> were taken prisoners by the <term type="tribe">Matibule</term> of 
<lb/><persName>Mosilikatze</persName> (who I may mention now lives 12 days <choice><abbr>E N E</abbr><expan>East Northeast</expan></choice> of the

<lb/>day &amp; fled up some high rock for <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>safety by night during 
<lb/>the whole of this weary journey. Poor creatures it was 
<lb/>affecting to hear their tale of woe. Their sufferings made 
<lb/>them the mere skeletons of what they formerly were But 
<lb/>as they were to use the <orgName>native</orgName> phrase, "only women" nobody 
<lb/><space unit="chars" extent="1"/>cared about them. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>The</corr></choice> sight of <orgName>these people</orgName> frightened 
<lb/>mine. It was in vain I urged I had engaged them to carry 
<lb/>me to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> <unclear cert="low">No</unclear>, they lay down on their faces 
<lb/>&amp; if these had not been <orgName>black</orgName> I am sure they would have <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="blotting"/>
<lb/>pale with fear . <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>I had to leave the waggon with them &amp; <w>pro-
<lb break="no"/><add place="marginleft">-</add>ceed</w> on <term type="animal">ox</term>back with three of <orgName><persName>Bubi's</persName> men</orgName> as <term type="occupation">guides</term>, most 
<lb/>faithful fellows I found them. They were as kind as men could 
<lb/>be. <choice><sic>they</sic><corr>They</corr></choice> always gave me the best place at the fire, the best bed 
<lb/>under the bush at which we slept &amp; the first cut of the <term type="foodstuff">meat</term>
<lb/>However hungry they were themselves <space unit="chars" extent="1"/>they always waited untill
<lb/>I had eaten. <space unit="chars" extent="2"/>We were entirely dependant on my gun for 
<lb/>provisions. When I killed anything we took a meal off the
<lb/><choice><sic>carcase</sic><corr>carcass</corr></choice>, a piece to hang over our shoulders &amp; away we went
<lb/>sometimes we had plenty to eat at other times we had to 
<lb/>feast on the delectable things we saw in our dreams
<lb/>It was a tiresome journey of more than 400 miles But I 
<lb/>saw many whom I should otherwise never spoken to
<lb/>I in particular remember my interviews with the <term type="tribe">Bakalihari</term>
<lb/>through part of whose country we travelled. <del type="blot">The</del> pleasure of 
<lb/>visiting them &amp; making known the way of life to their 
<lb/>poor degraded &amp; <orgName>enslaved people</orgName> far surpassed the fatigue 
<lb/>of travelling<space unit="chars" extent="2"/>. <choice><sic>they</sic><corr>They</corr></choice> were more attentive than any <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term>
<lb/>I have seen. <space unit="chars" extent="3"/>When at <term type="tribe">the <unclear cert="low">Bakaa</unclear></term> in descending the huge 
<lb/>basaltic rocks to our sleeping place below with the <bibl>testament</bibl>
<lb/>in my hand I felt as if falling &amp; making an effort to save

<lb/>by a <term type="animal">lion</term> as near as from your parlour to the opposite side of
