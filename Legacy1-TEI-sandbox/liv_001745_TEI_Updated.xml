<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Shupanga</placeName>, <placeName>Zambesi</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">12 March 1862</p>
<lb/><p><persName>Rev<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">d</hi></hi> D<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Candlish</persName></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p>I am happy to inform 
<lb/>you that <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Stewart</persName> arrived off the 
<lb/>mouth of this river on the last day 
<lb/>of January, and as it appeared 
<lb/>that the most satisfactory way 
<lb/>of going to work would be for 
<lb/>him to come and see the country 
<lb/>and people with his own eyes, 
<lb/>I invited him to accompany us 
<lb/>while trying to take a steamer up 
<lb/>to Lake Nyassa. By the kind 
<lb/>assistance of <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> of 
<lb/><term type="boat">H. M. S. Gorgon</term> we soon had most of 
<lb/>the hull aboard the <term type="boat">Pioneer</term>, but 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001745_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>soon found out that she could not 
<lb/>carry 35 tons of her sister, so we are 
<lb/>forced to put the Lake steamer together 
<lb/>here, and then tow her up to the 
<lb/>cataracts. We did not anticipate this 
<lb/>detention of two months. <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Stewart</persName>
<lb/>will however be employed in 
<lb/>picking up what he can of the 
<lb/>language, and supposing him to be 
<lb/>successful in his noble purpose of 
<lb/>organizing a mission, this will 
<lb/>prove no loss of time. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he language 
<lb/>is unreduced, and if you have 
<lb/>never tried to write down the 
<lb/>gibberish that seems to be bluttered 
<lb/>out of the people's mouths, you 
<lb/>will scarcely believe that the 
<lb/>reduction of a language is such a 
<lb/>gigantic task as it is. The tongue 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001745_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>is spoken at <placeName>Senna</placeName> &amp; <placeName>Tette</placeName> on the 
<lb/><placeName>Zambesi</placeName> - and up to the end of <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Nyassa</placeName> 400 miles to the North - the <persName>bishop <add place="above">Mackenzie</add></persName> is working at it, but years 
<lb/>must elapse before it can become 
<lb/>a proper or copious vehicle of 
<lb/>religious thought.</p>
<lb/><p>I have given <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi> Stewart</persName> a 
<lb/>cordial and hearty welcome. I 
<lb/>rejoice in the prospect of 
<lb/>another mission where there is 
<lb/>so very much room for work. 
<lb/>Nineteen thousand slaves pass 
<lb/>annually through the custom 
<lb/>house of <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> and according 
<lb/>to <persName>Colonel Rigby</persName> H M consul there 
<lb/>the chief portion of them comes from 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName>. We hope to do 
<w>some-<lb break="no"/>thing</w> towards stopping this traffic 
<lb/>but it is only by christian 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001745_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>missions and example that the 
<lb/>evil can be thoroughly rooted out. 
<lb/>From all I have observed of <persName>M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>S.</persName> he seems to have been specially 
<lb/>raised up for the work, and 
<lb/>specially well adapted for it. 
<lb/>Before becoming acquainted with 
<lb/>him I spoke cautiously - perhaps 
<lb/>gave too much prominence to difficulties 
<lb/>of which I myself make small account 
<lb/>and may have been led to it by having 
<lb/>seen missionaries come out with 
<lb/>curious notions - willing to endure 
<lb/>hardships, but grumbling like mountains 
<lb/>in the family way when put about by 
<lb/>things that they did not expect, but to 
<lb/>such a man 
<lb/>I would say boldly, Go 
<lb/>Forward &amp; with the Divine blessing 
<lb/>you will surely succeed.</p>
