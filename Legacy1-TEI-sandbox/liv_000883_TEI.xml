<lb/><p>My Dear Sir </p>
<lb/><p>Reached this the 
<lb/>farthest inland station at present occupied 
<lb/>by the Portuguese early this morning, and 
<lb/>though I feel pretty well tired out from 
<lb/>marching through a rough, stoney, bushey 
<lb/>country without path for the last week 
<lb/>or so. It gives me much pleasure to be 
<lb/>again able to address those whom I left 
<lb/>some years ago in the world. When we 
<lb/>came to the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName> below the falls or 
<lb/>rather near its confluence with the <placeName>Kafue</placeName>
<lb/>or <placeName>Bashukulompo</placeName> river we found 
<lb/>ourselves among tsetse, which soon 
<lb/>settled all the oxen. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he usual mode 
<lb/>of travelling is by canoe and the 
<lb/>thick jungle and hills all along on 
<lb/>both banks of the river make travelling 
<lb/>on foot very tedious. Had I been

<lb/>a little richer and had purchased a canoe 
<lb/>I should have been here six weeks ago. But 
<lb/>I am in perfect health and when rested 
<lb/>will probably be ready to forgive my 
<lb/>ancestors for always acting on the principle 
<lb/>of "Man wants but little here below, nor 
<lb/>wants that little long". <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he Portuguese 
<lb/>are as kind here as they were in <placeName>Angola</placeName>
<lb/>and that is saying a great deal. Somehow 
<lb/>or other I had imbibed a sort of prejudice 
<lb/>against them, probably from their obstinate 
<lb/>persistence in the slave trade. But 
<lb/>actual intercourse has fully convinced 
<lb/>me that we are liable to form a very 
<lb/>wrong opinion of the majority from 
<lb/>the contunaceous acts of the few. 
<lb/>I believe I am a good deal indebted to 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Duprat</persName> for his kind recommendations<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I have not met with a single instance 
<lb/>of incivility among them, and many 
<lb/>of them are men of intelligence with 
<lb/>whom it is refreshing to pass an hour<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is utterly unlike the everlasting

<lb/><p>I cannot give you any precise 
<lb/>information in this note. I believe our 
<lb/>prospects are pretty fair though there will 
<lb/>always be enough of danger in the 
<lb/>enterprise in these parts to make none 
<lb/>but men of pluck engage in it. I think 
<lb/>we have water carriage all the way 
<lb/>by this fine river to within 1ยบ or 2ยบ of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Makololo</placeName>. Near the coast the 
<lb/>fever prevails more than it does inland 
<lb/><choice><sic>until</sic><corr>until</corr></choice> you get into the great valley, then 
<lb/>here and below this there is danger of 
<lb/>being robbed. But on the whole I am 
<lb/>not disposed to think our prospects 
<lb/>dark. Having once been robbed by 
<lb/>a congregation of Christian murderers 
<lb/>one is not timorous of the heathen<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>After resting a few days I intend going 
<lb/>down the river to <placeName>Quillimane</placeName>. Believe 
<lb/>me ever yours Affectionately<reg>.</reg></p>

<lb/><p>I enclose the Director's letter 
<lb/>to you. It would be a mercy 
<lb/>to them to have it copied. It was 
<lb/>so hot the ink would not stick, 
<lb/>yet some of it is for them only. </p>
