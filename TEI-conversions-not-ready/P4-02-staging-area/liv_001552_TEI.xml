<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Mazaro, Zambesi River</placeName></p>
<lb/><p rend="right">25<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> March 1860. </p>
<lb/><p rend="right"><hi rend="underline">Private</hi></p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>In consequence of the loss 
<lb/>of a mail bag on the bar off <placeName>Kongone harbour</placeName>
<lb/>we are <add place="above">not</add> aware whether in the hurry of parting 
<lb/>you bestowed a thought on us. But 
<lb/>feeling persuaded that you will be  
<lb/>disposed to aid us <choice><sic>whever</sic><corr>wherever</corr></choice> you are. I beg 
<lb/>your attention to the question of free 
<lb/>navigation on this river which I have 
<lb/>brought before <persName>Lord John Russell</persName>, the 
<lb/>Portuguese make no use of the <placeName>river Zambesi</placeName>
<lb/>below this point, nor have they ever 
<lb/>ascended the <placeName>Shire</placeName> more than a few miles 
<lb/>above the confluence, their line of 
<lb/>exploration ran across country from 
<lb/><placeName>Sofala</placeName> to <placeName>Senna</placeName>, and then down to <placeName>Quilimane</placeName>. 
<lb/>The Governor of <placeName>Tette</placeName> acknowledges in a 
<lb/>letter to <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Dupratt</persName> published in the Cape 
<lb/>Argus in August last, that we are the first 
<lb/>that ever came from the sea to that district 
<lb/>by the mouths of the <placeName>Zambesi</placeName>. Now I would 
<lb/>not object to own their lordship over 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001552_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>parts known or traded to by them, but 
<lb/>we have opened a new region by going 
<lb/>up the <placeName>Shire</placeName>; and <persName>Burton</persName> &amp; <persName>Speke</persName> have 
<lb/>explored that region still farther, and 
<lb/>confirmed what we advanced respecting 
<lb/>the form and fertility of the country, as 
<lb/>well as the disposition of the inhabitants: 
<lb/>and it seems feasible to suppose that 
<lb/>English settlers in that Highland region 
<lb/>would both <choice><sic>develope</sic><corr>develop</corr></choice> the trade in cotton, 
<lb/>and soon stop the supply of slaves to 
<lb/>various ports on the East coast. 
<lb/>I am so fully persuaded of this, that 
<lb/>should the Government not grant 
<lb/>the means of placing a small steamer 
<lb/>on <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> to afford protection to settlers 
<lb/>and <choice><sic>develope</sic><corr>develop</corr></choice> the lawful trade which 
<lb/>crosses the Lake at various points. 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">that</del> I now send home <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Rae</persName> our 
<lb/>engineer to superintend the construction 
<lb/>of one at my own expense. If the 
<lb/>Portuguese hear of our plan they will 
<lb/>be up in arms against it, and put on 
<lb/>restrictions that will prove real obstructions. 
<lb/>I don<reg>'</reg>t see why they should retain the

<lb/>2/ <!-- TODO SM/CO: Is this correct? --><choice><sic>the</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> power of doing this - we ought to have 
<lb/>free passage in to our discoveries; and 
<lb/>our success without diminishing their 
<lb/>territory an inch, would promote the 
<lb/>prosperity of their establishments. You 
<lb/>will appreciate my earnestness in this 
<lb/>matter when you remember that their 
<lb/>settlements are not colonies, but small 
<lb/>penal settlements entailing a loss of £5000 
<lb/>or £6000 annually on the mother country, 
<lb/>and sending not a particle of trade home; 
<lb/>and never a single African made fortune 
<lb/>to be spent there. The Governors, no matter 
<lb/>what professions they make all get as 
<lb/>much into their pockets from slave traders 
<lb/>as possible. The present <persName>Governor General 
<lb/>of Mozambique</persName> - an educated &amp; enlightened 
<lb/>man, winked at a regular system of 
<lb/>French slave emigration from near <placeName>Quilimane</placeName>
<lb/>for two years, and then when the affair 
<lb/>of the Charles &amp; Georges caused a stir in 
<lb/><placeName>Europe</placeName>, made a formal <choice><sic>denuntiation</sic><corr>denunciation</corr></choice> in 
<lb/>the "Boletin of Mozambique" of those who 
<lb/>carried it on. It was carried on under 
<lb/>the very eye of the <persName>Governor of Quilimane</persName>. 
<lb/>It was well known to His <persName>Excellency of 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001552_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>Mozambique</persName> for everything is reported, 
<lb/>and each Governor knows even the 
<lb/>private affairs of all the people of his district. 
<lb/>When this <choice><sic>denuntiation</sic><corr>denunciation</corr></choice> appeared the emigration 
<lb/>agent <persName>(Senhor Cruz)</persName> retired to <placeName>Bombay,</placeName>
<lb/>and thence to <placeName>Bourbon</placeName>; and as every 
<lb/>one expected, has now returned to <placeName>Quillimane</placeName>
<lb/>to carry on the same or a worse system. 
<lb/>People here talk openly of the Governors 
<lb/>being bribed to allow these things, and from 
<lb/>all I have seen of the officials, I feel certain 
<lb/>that they would hamper a movement 
<lb/>such as I propose by every means in 
<lb/>their power. We want only free access 
<lb/>by harbours and parts of the river of 
<lb/>which the Portuguese make no use 
<lb/>whatever - to parts quite beyond their 
<lb/>trade and even geographical knowledge. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hen their numbers are so small 
<lb/>if we exclude the military there are not 
<lb/>20 real Portuguese on the river and 
<lb/>only 150 or 200 half casts. Portugal does 
<lb/>not intend to send colonists, those 
<lb/>actually sent are a class of military 
<lb/>called "Incorrigibles" and the chief trade 
<lb/>which is only paltry peddling in ivory 
<lb/>and gold dust is in the hands of

<lb/>3/ <!-- TODO SM/CO: Is this correct? If this is just the page number, then it should be coded using fw--> the few officers employed to look after 
<lb/>these worthies. The exclusive - "dog in the 
<lb/>manger" policy pursued, is almost entirely 
<lb/>for the benefit of these men. No women 
<lb/>are sent out, and frightful immorality is 
<lb/>the consequence. I say little about them 
<lb/>publicly, because I have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> much 
<lb/>kindness from individuals among them - 
<lb/>but a more used up syphilitic race does 
<lb/>not exist in the world. With a soil and 
<lb/>climate superior to <placeName>Natal</placeName> we can get neither 
<lb/>fresh meat nor vegetables between the sea &amp; <placeName>Tette</placeName> for either love or money. On the coast 
<lb/>we get abundance of game &amp; live splendidly 
<lb/>bushbuck, waterbuck &amp; the oryx abound 
<lb/>but inland the grass is too tall for hunting 
<lb/>and we are put on salt provisions or 
<lb/>starve. I have laid the whole matter before 
<lb/><persName>Lord John Russell</persName>, and if you can say a 
<lb/>word in behalf of urging a more open 
<lb/>system on the Portuguese, you will confer 
<lb/>a great favour = I do not know 
<lb/>whether a silent system might work 
<lb/>out our ends. If we were allowed to 
<lb/>hoist a pendant the officials could not

<lb/>interfere with us, yet I fear the opposition 
<lb/>of the whole population when they see 
<lb/>whither our efforts tend in eating out 
<lb/>the slave trade. They are rather glad at 
<lb/>having cleverly as they think, restricted my 
<lb/>consulate to <placeName>Quilimane</placeName>, and I say 
<lb/>nothing respecting my being accredited 
<lb/>to the independent tribes beyond them. </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he loss of the mail bag though I hear 
<lb/>of its having been picked up in a damaged 
<lb/>state and conveyed to <placeName>Tette</placeName> has entailed 
<lb/>ignorance of the intentions of Government 
<lb/>respecting the "Bann" which my naval 
<lb/>officer led me to reject, or another steamer. 
<lb/>If we get a powerful vessel we intend 
<lb/>to try and reach <placeName>Lake Nyassa</placeName> by the <placeName>Rovuma</placeName>
<lb/>a river which is said to flow out of it, 
<lb/>and to be navigable 100 leagues in land - 
<lb/>It is beyond Portuguese territory, and from 
<lb/>its situation on the map appears to be about 
<lb/>what we conjecture to be the Northern end 
<lb/>of that Lake. It has a depth of three fathoms 
<lb/>at the entrance and no bar - but free 
<lb/>navigation here would answer our purpose 
<lb/>as well. </p>

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_001552_0007"/><!--pb/@n='4r'-->
<lb/><p>I need scarcely say that I am as 
<lb/>sorry as any one on account of 
<lb/>your departure from the <placeName>Cape.</placeName>
<lb/>But I hope it may be only to 
<lb/>afford you wider scope for 
<lb/>your energies. Should you favour 
<lb/>me with a line will you mention 
<lb/>where a famous despatch respecting 
<lb/>the treatment of native tribes is to 
<lb/>be found. I hear about it 
<lb/>but being long out of the world 
<lb/>never met with it. </p>
