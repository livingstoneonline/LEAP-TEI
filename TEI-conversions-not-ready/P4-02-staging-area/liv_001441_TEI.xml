<lb/><p>My Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>We have lately 
<lb/>discovered a very fine Lake by going 
<lb/>up this river in the steam Launch 
<lb/>about one hundred miles and then 
<lb/>marching some fifty more on foot. 
<lb/>It is called <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> and <placeName>Lake 
<lb/>Ngami</placeName> is a mere pond in comparison<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is moreover particularly interesting 
<lb/>from the fact reported by the 
<lb/>natives on its shores that it is 
<lb/>separated by a strip of land of 
<lb/>only five or six miles in width 
<lb/>from <placeName>Nyanja</placeName> or rather  Lake 
<lb/><placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName> = the stars, which <persName>Burton</persName>
<lb/>has gone to explore. We could 
<lb/>hear nothing of his party at 
<lb/><placeName>Shirwa</placeName> and having got no 
<lb/>European news since you 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001441_0002"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>kindly sent some copies of the 
<lb/>"Times" last year we are quite in the 
<lb/>dark as to whether he has succeeded 
<lb/>or not. <placeName>Lake Shirwa</placeName> has no 
<lb/>outlet and its waters are bitter but 
<lb/>drinkable. It abounds in fishes 
<lb/>Leeches alligators &amp; hippopotami. 
<lb/>We discovered also by examining 
<lb/>partially a branch of the <placeName>Shire</placeName> called 
<lb/><placeName>Ruo</placeName> that one portion of <placeName>Shirwa</placeName>
<lb/>is not more than 30 miles distant 
<lb/>from a point that may easily be 
<lb/>reached by this Launch which by 
<lb/>Newspaper measurement draws 13 
<lb/>inches, and actually 31 inches, the 
<lb/><placeName>Lake Shirwa</placeName> is very grand. It is 
<lb/>surrounded on all sides by lofty green 
<lb/>mountains - <placeName>Dzomba</placeName> or as people 
<lb/>nearest it say <placeName>Zomba</placeName> is over 6000 
<lb/>feet high of same shape as <placeName>Table 
<lb/>mountain</placeName> but inhabited on the top 
<lb/>others are equally high but inaccessible<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It is a high land region - the Lake itself 
<lb/>being about 2000 ft above the sea<reg>.</reg></p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001441_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><p>It is 20 or 30 miles wide - and 
<lb/>50 or 60 long. On going some way 
<lb/>up a hill we saw in the far distance 
<lb/>two mountain tops rising like little 
<lb/>islands on a watery horizon. An 
<lb/>inhabited mountain island stands near 
<lb/>where we first came to it. From the 
<lb/>size of the waves it is supposed to 
<lb/>be deep. <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Maclear</persName> will shew you the map. </p>
<lb/><p><persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName> and I with 15 Makololo 
<lb/>formed the land party, the country 
<lb/>is well peopled and very much 
<lb/>like <placeName>Londa</placeName> in the middle of the 
<lb/>country - many streams rising 
<lb/>out of bogs, the vegetation nearly 
<lb/>identical also. Never saw so 
<lb/>much cotton grown as among 
<lb/>the Mang-anga of the Shire &amp; 
<lb/>Shirwa valleys - all spin and 
<lb/>weave it. These are the Latitudes 
<lb/>which I have always pointed out 
<lb/>as the cotton and sugar lands 
<lb/>they are pre-eminently so, but 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001441_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>such is the disinterestedness of some people 
<lb/>that labour is exported to Bourbon instead 
<lb/>of being employed here. The only trade the 
<lb/>people have is that of slaves; and the only 
<lb/>symptoms of impudence we met were 
<lb/>from a party of Bajaua slave traders 
<lb/>but they changed their deportment instantly 
<lb/>on hearing that we were English and 
<lb/>not Portuguese. There are no Maravi at 
<lb/>or near <placeName>Shirwa</placeName>. They are all West of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Shire</placeName> so this Lake can scarcely be 
<lb/>called <placeName>"Lake Maravi</placeName> but the Portuguese 
<lb/>know nothing of it, but the Minister who 
<lb/>claimed <add place="above">(Blue book for 1857)</add> the honour of first traversing the 
<lb/>African continent for two <hi rend="underline">black men</hi>
<lb/>with Portuguese names, must explain 
<lb/>why they did not cross <placeName>Shirwa</placeName>. It lies 
<lb/>some forty or fifty miles on each side 
<lb/>of the Latitude of <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>. </p>
<lb/><p>(they came to <placeName>Tette</placeName> only &amp; lacked at 
<lb/>least 400 miles of <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>). We go 
<lb/>back to <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> in July and may 
<lb/>make a push for <placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName> but say 
<lb/>nothing at present about it. We have 
<lb/>not told the Portuguese how near <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> is to them. We let that come to them from 
<lb/>our own Government but they mean to 
<lb/>claim all by setting up a station forthwith at 
<lb/>the mouth of this river! <persName>David Livingstone</persName></p>
