<lb/><p>My Dear Sir George </p>
<lb/><p>We have found an 
<lb/>opening in a direction we never expected 
<lb/>for we find that this river really comes 
<lb/>out of <add place="above">the hitherto undiscovered<del type="strikethrough"> Lake</del></add><placeName>Nyassa</placeName> one of those Lakes 
<lb/>with which <placeName>Africa</placeName> is studded. We traced 
<lb/>the <placeName>Shire</placeName> up to the point of departure 
<lb/>in 14· 25' S. lat and we found that 
<lb/>there are only 33 miles of cataracts above 
<lb/>this point when the river becomes 
<lb/>placid again and continues so right 
<lb/>into the Lake. From <placeName>Kongone Harbour</placeName>
<lb/>to this (<placeName>Murchison's cataract</placeName>) we have 
<lb/>at least a two fathom channel all the 
<lb/>year for <placeName>Shire</placeName> never varies more 
<lb/>than from 2 to 3 feet between the dry 
<lb/>and wet seasons - And the Lake itself 
<lb/>never varies more, if so much, so it 
<lb/>must be large, and well fed. We could 
<lb/>not explore it, because we had left 
<lb/><persName>Macgregor's Laird's</persName> precious punt in 
<lb/>a sinking state. Funnel - Furnace 
<lb/>Deck &amp; Bottom all went <choice><sic>done</sic><corr>down</corr></choice> simultaneously 
<lb/>after only 12 months wear. 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001475_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>Nor could we get any information as to "how far off its head lay." <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> or as its 
<lb/>name is <placeName>Tamandua</placeName> is ninety miles 
<lb/>long. <placeName>Shirwa</placeName> means great water only 
<lb/>and is applied to the sea. We have opened 
<lb/>a cotton field of unknown extent and 
<lb/>superior to the American inasmuch as 
<lb/>there are no frosts to cut off the crop, 
<lb/>and instead of the endless labour in 
<lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, one sowing of Foreign seed 
<lb/>already introduced by the natives, yields 
<lb/>for three years. The land beyond the 
<lb/><placeName>cataracts</placeName> lies in three terraces. The <placeName>Shire 
<lb/>valley</placeName> being the lower one is about 
<lb/>1200 feet high - a second East of this &amp; 
<lb/>three miles broad is over 2000 while 
<lb/>a third still East &amp; over twelve miles 
<lb/>broad is upwards of 3000 feet at its 
<lb/>Western edge, or about equal to your 
<lb/><placeName>Table mountain</placeName>. On this terrace rises 
<lb/><placeName>Mount Zomba</placeName> which in round numbers 
<lb/>maybe called between 7000 &amp; 8000 feet 
<lb/>high. Our encampment on its southern 
<lb/>edge was nearly 7000 and <persName>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kirk</persName>
<lb/>in botanizing ascended the S.W. peak 
<lb/>about a mile distant and found it 
<lb/>some 400 or 500 above the camp. 
<lb/>We travelled in the hottest season of the year 
<lb/>that called in <placeName>west Africa</placeName> "the smokes" 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001475_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/>when from the burning of immense tracts 
<lb/>of country covered with tall grass the 
<lb/>atmosphere is a thick haze all around. 
<lb/>It was very hot in the valley but when 
<lb/>we ascended to the second terrace the 
<lb/>air was refreshing. And on the third it 
<lb/>was delightful while on <placeName>Zomba</placeName> it 
<lb/>was cold. The terraces are wonderfully 
<lb/>well supplied with running rills of 
<lb/>deliciously cool water, and cotton is grown 
<lb/>very extensively every where. On <placeName>Zomba</placeName>
<lb/>itself there is a large valley with a fine 
<lb/>stream and much cultivation though not 
<lb/>of cotton. I mention these peculiarities 
<lb/>in the physical conformation of the 
<lb/>country that you may <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> we 
<lb/>have changes of climate within a few 
<lb/>miles of each other. These, for keeping 
<lb/>people will, and I think one of the 
<lb/>greatest benefits this Expedition will 
<lb/>confer is the speedy cure of fever even 
<lb/>in the lowlands without, in general, 
<lb/>loss of strength to the patient. The land 
<lb/>beyond <placeName>Zomba</placeName> contracts between <placeName>Shire</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Nyassa</placeName> or <placeName>Nyinyesi</placeName> into a narrow 
<lb/>isthmus, and the trade from the interior 
<lb/>passes along this isthmus. We met a

<lb/><choice><sic>a</sic><corr>no text</corr></choice> large East coast slaving party with an 
<lb/>immense number of slaves <choice><sic>on</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> elephants<reg>'</reg>
<lb/>tusks - We bought some fine specimens 
<lb/>of Malachite from them which they had 
<lb/>got in Cazamebe's country. They were the 
<lb/>most <choice><sic>blackgaurd</sic><corr>blackguard</corr></choice><add place="above">looking</add> lot I ever saw and 
<lb/>that is saying a great deal seeing I lived 
<lb/>long beyond the colony. They seemed to 
<lb/>get into a panic when they knew we were 
<lb/>English for by night they evaporated. Probably 
<lb/>they had the same opinion of us as we had of them. </p>
<lb/><p><hi rend="underline">Confidential</hi> All the trade for a large tract 
<lb/>of East Coast passes along the Isthmus and 
<lb/>we propose an English station there, but 
<lb/>the Portuguese would be up in arms did 
<lb/>they know. We could with ease cut off 
<lb/>much of the slave trade for <placeName>Mozambique</placeName> the <placeName>Augoxia</placeName> river &amp; other ports and 
<lb/>a plan is sent home to Government 
<lb/>for the purpose. A common road 
<lb/>could with ease be made past the <placeName>cataracts</placeName>
<lb/>and a steamer placed on the Lake - not 
<lb/>a <persName>Macgregor Laird's</persName> sham but a good 
<lb/>one screwed together at home in a 
<w>work-<lb break="no"/>manlike</w> manner. We must have English 
<lb/>colonization. I have no doubt as to 
<lb/>its success had we a man like you 
<lb/>to set it agoing<reg>.</reg></p>
