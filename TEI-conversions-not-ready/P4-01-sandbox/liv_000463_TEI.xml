<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>London</placeName> 17 June 1840 </p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Friend </p>
<lb/><p>In compliance with your request 
<lb/>I shall not now endeavour to give utterance to the 
<lb/>emotions which spring up in my bosom when 
<lb/>I yesterday received your letter. I do this 
<lb/>rather reluctantly because, in returning thanks 
<lb/>to Him who bestows every good &amp; perfect gift, 
<lb/>I would fain include the instrument through 
<lb/>whom the blessing has come - </p>
<lb/><p>I was not aware that I had made 
<lb/>known my pecuniary difficulties to any one 
<lb/>besides him who knows all things, but as 
<lb/>I now address a brother disciple of Jesus &amp; a 
<lb/>friend who (quite unexpected by me) has taken <add place="above">an interest</add> in 
<lb/>my future course, I may mention that these 
<lb/>difficulties were chiefly prospective &amp; that 
<lb/>the Lord has now dispelled all my fears 
<lb/>&amp; lifted off completely all those cares which 
<lb/>I had, with great freedom the very night 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000463_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>proceeding the arrival of your letter, spread out 
<lb/>before his throne of grace<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Allow me also to mention that <add place="above">it may be said</add> through 
<lb/>you Our Gracious Father has assisted one 
<lb/>who, with far greater love &amp; zeal &amp; I might say 
<lb/>also, abilities than mine, has left this for 
<lb/>another country for the purpose of prosecuting 
<lb/>those studies which help to qualify for 
<lb/>engaging in that most honorable work in 
<lb/>which I hope to spend my life. His departure 
<lb/>having been the chief cause of <del type="strikethrough">my</del> the low 
<lb/>state of my resources - </p>
<lb/><p>I feel very grateful for the <hi rend="underline">manner</hi> in which 
<lb/>you have shewn your kindness &amp; would beg an 
<lb/>interest in your prayers that I may not, after 
<lb/>all that the Lord has done for me, become 
<lb/>an unprofitable servant. I shall never cease 
<lb/>to pray that every temporal &amp; spiritual blessing 
<lb/>may descend upon you &amp; that the Lord will 
<lb/>fulfil the utmost desire of your heart with 
<lb/>respect to every one of your beloved family<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>Yours very affectionately <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">D.</hi></hi> Livingston </p>
