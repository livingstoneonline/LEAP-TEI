<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName>Kuruman</placeName> 25 June 1843</p>
<lb/><p>My Dear Friend</p>
<lb/><p>In <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Pyne's</persName> letter I have neglected to give 
<w>Mission-<lb break="no"/>ary</w> information. In this I shall endeavour to supply the 
<lb/>omission and as you may feel a little imterest in what 
<lb/>relates more immediately to my own efforts in that cause I shall 
<lb/>give you some account of my recent tour into the Interior<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I left on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Feb, last &amp; returned a few days ago, part 
<lb/>of this journey was in my waggon &amp; about 400 miles of 
<lb/>it on a pack ox. It was very warm in that country 
<lb/>I was exposed to some dangers but have much reason 
<lb/>to be grateful to Him who preserved my health &amp; 
<lb/>rescued me from every danger. I had many 
<w>opportun-<lb break="no"/>ities</w> of preaching the gospel, &amp; frequently to those who had 
<lb/>never before heard the voice or seen the face of a 
<lb/>European. My first stage was 10 days from this 
<lb/>&amp; at the village where <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> with the remains of his 
<lb/>tribe have taken up his abode. I related to you the 
<lb/>sad doings of <persName>Mahura</persName> among that tribe. Some of our 
<lb/>people having been there (with S.) at the time of attack 
<lb/>&amp; under <add place="above">in</add> circumstances which could not fail to 
<lb/>excite the minds of the Heathen against the gospel I therefore 
<lb/>felt most anxious to go &amp; by my explanations &amp; 
<lb/>presence endeavour to eradicate their prejudices. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat 
<lb/>you may understand what the feelings of the heathen were 
<lb/>in reference to our people<reg>.</reg> I may mention that they 
<lb/>having accidentally fired a gun the night previous to the 
<lb/>attack, it was considered by S's people as having been the 
<lb/>signal by which to apprise <persName>Mahura</persName> of the situation in which 
<lb/>the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="low">Wanketze</unclear></term> stood. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he singing at family worship their 
<lb/>incantations to insure success in the <add place="above"><del type="strikethrough">the</del> attack of</add> next morning &amp; 
<lb/>the collecting them together on sunday mornning for worship 
<lb/>as no other than a pretext to get them more easily 
<w>slaughter-<lb break="no"/>ed.</w> On account of these circumstances we felt much 
<lb/>grieved, &amp; earnestly longed for an opportunity to disabuse their 
<lb/>minds<reg>.</reg> But I could get no one to go out with me, some who 
<lb/>thought I might ask them immediately absconded for the dread 
<lb/>of certain death was on every mind when they thought on the Interior<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>By the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Feb however I prevailed on three to accompany 
<lb/>me. But a more craven hearted set never ate corn, one of 
<lb/>them was with the party of believers who visited <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> previous 
<lb/>to the attack. We unyoked outside his village &amp; fearing to leave their 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000532_0002"/><!--pb/@n='1v'-->
<lb/>man by the waggon as mischief might have ensued had he been 
<w>recog-<lb break="no"/>nised</w> by the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="low">Wanketzi</unclear></term>(apart from myself)I said come along let us 
<lb/>go to the king. He seemed reluctant enough but followed. When we 
<lb/>came to the <unclear cert="low">cove</unclear> where <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> was seated on the ground I squatted 
<lb/>down beside him. His warriors immediately recognised my servant 
<lb/>&amp; neither words nor looks betokened any complacency towards him. The 
<lb/>poor fellow looked 'inutterable things' and as soon as the uproarious 
<lb/>recognition was over <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> turned to me &amp; demanded why I 
<lb/>had attacked him, destroyed all his people, &amp; stolen his cattle. I in turn 
<lb/>demanded why he had refused to the advice I tendered him by the 
<w>messen-<lb break="no"/>gers</w> by whom he sent me an ox <add place="above">&amp; thus destroy himself</add> not to leave the <placeName>Bakalihari desert</placeName>. 
<lb/>Did the messengers fail to deliver my message or did he discredit my 
<lb/>words. I told him I had said to his messenger that if <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> left 
<lb/>that country <persName>Mahura</persName> would certainly attack him. He answered 
<lb/>the messengers told him all. But his heart sore longed again to eat 
<lb/>corn, <term type="medical">fevers</term> had destroyed many of his people while his oxen had 
<lb/>increased to much he could not get them taken care of. He 
<lb/>did not discredit my words but was induced to have that country 
<lb/>by the <unclear cert="low">?</unclear> of his people. &amp; not knowing the power of guns 
<lb/>he dispersed the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term>. Poor man he now knows it to his cost<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>May these afflictions be blessed to his soul. <choice><reg>S</reg><orig>s</orig></choice>ome of the messengers 
<lb/>who came to me last year still survive &amp; recognised me. <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName>
<lb/>&amp; I soon became very good friends. The day following that 
<lb/>on which I arrived being Sabbath I was pleased to hear before 
<w>day-<lb break="no"/>light</w> the kings herald proclaiming from an emminence "that no 
<lb/>work must be done on that day. We must do nothing but pray 
<lb/>to God &amp; listen to the words of the foreigner, all must come to 
<lb/>hear, <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> will not suffer anyone to remain behind.<reg>"</reg> This 
<lb/>was by way of honouring me I having explained to him the day before 
<lb/>the nature of our Sabbath. His people were all entirely ignorant 
<lb/>of God. He was seen by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> once, But does not 
<lb/>remember anything that was then preached to him. It is probable 
<lb/>as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> M.</persName> was then young &amp; did not understand the language <term type="tribe">the 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">Wanketzi</unclear></term> did not understand what was preached. The comet 
<lb/>which <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> P.</persName> averted to in hers of december last, we saw in 
<lb/>the month of march. It was a glorious sight <choice><reg>b</reg><orig>B</orig></choice>ut inspired 
<lb/>all the inhabitants of the interior with terror. <term type="tribe">The Batlapi</term> thought 
<lb/>that <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> had brought it in order to kill them for their 
<lb/>attack upon him, &amp; <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> asked me if <persName>Mahura</persName> was dead 
<lb/>as he thought the comet was the signal of that event<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I visited <term type="tribe">the Bakhatla</term>, the chief of that tribe fled into the desert 
<lb/>with <persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe</unclear></persName> &amp; has just now returned to his own land. He was 
<lb/>particularly friendly to us, I asked him if he should like me 
<lb/>to come &amp; live with him<reg>.</reg> He held up his hands &amp; exclaimed <reg>"</reg>O I shall 
<lb/>dance if you say you will come<reg>"</reg>, I asked if he would give 
<lb/>me a garden, they have no idea of selling land. Wherever 
<lb/>one chooses to plough that is his land. We however have 
<lb/>to make a bargain in order to have a permanent property near 
<lb/>their villages over which the king has no power<reg>.</reg> He said 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000532_0003"/><!--pb/@n='2r'-->
<lb/><reg>"</reg>I shall call all your people to <del type="strikethrough">plou</del><add place="above">hoe</add> for you, &amp; you shall have more 
<lb/>corn &amp; sweet seed than I have<reg>"</reg>. We shall do every thing to assist 
<lb/>you. It is probable <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> &amp; myself will go &amp; settle with 
<lb/>him soon. But I must go on to the rest of my journey. 
<lb/>I visited the <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> again but the recent commotions 
<lb/>have quite <del type="strikethrough"><gap agent="illgblDel"/></del> changed all the former state of things. No 
<lb/>one now lives where he formerly resided. <persName>Bubi</persName> has fled from 
<lb/>the spot where we led out the water last year, <persName>Sechele</persName> has 
<lb/>come southwards, <term type="tribe">the Bamangwato</term> have fled into the holes 
<lb/>of the rocks &amp; live like <term type="tribe">the Bakua</term> &amp; <term type="tribe">Bamakalaka</term>, many of 
<lb/><persName><unclear cert="low">Sebegwe's</unclear></persName> women were taken prisoners by the <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> of 
<lb/><persName>Mosilikatze</persName> (who I may mention now lives 12 days E N E of the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> &amp; still acts as formerly)<reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hese escaping from 
<lb/>them met us at <term type="tribe">the Bakwains</term><reg>.</reg><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey had subsisted on roots by 
<lb/>day &amp; fled up some high rock for safety by night during 
<lb/>the whole of this weary journey. Poor creatures it was 
<lb/>affecting to hear their tale of woe. Their sufferings made 
<lb/>them the mere skeletons of what they formerly were<reg>.</reg> But 
<lb/>as they were to use the native phrase, "only women" nobody 
<lb/>cared about them. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he sight of these people frightened 
<lb/>mine, it was in vain I urged I had engaged them to carry 
<lb/>me to <term type="tribe">the Bamangwato</term><unclear cert="low">tho</unclear>, they lay down on their faces 
<lb/>&amp; if there had not been black I am sure they would have <gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="blotting"/>
<lb/>pale with fear. I had to leave the waggon with them &amp; 
<w>pro-<lb break="no"/>ceed</w> on oxback with three of <persName>Bubi's</persName> men as guides, most 
<lb/>faithful fellows I found them, they were as kind as men could 
<lb/>be. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey always gave me the best place at the fire, the best bed 
<lb/>under the bush at which we slept &amp; the first cut of the meat<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>However hungry they were themselves they always waited <choice><sic>untill</sic><corr>until</corr></choice>
<lb/>I had eaten. We were entirely dependant on my gun for 
<lb/>provisions. When I killed anything we took a meal off 
<lb/>the carcase, a piece to hang over our shoulders &amp; away we went<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Sometimes we had plenty to eat at other times we had to 
<lb/>feast on the delectable things we saw in our dreams<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>It was a tiresome journey of more than 400 miles<reg>.</reg> But I 
<lb/>saw many whom I should otherwise never spoken to<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I in particular remember my interviews with <term type="tribe">the Bakalihari</term>
<lb/>through part of whose country we travelled. The Pleasure of 
<lb/>visiting them &amp; making known the way of life to their 
<lb/>poor degraded &amp; enslaved people far surpassed the fatigue 
<lb/>of travelling. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey were more attentive than any <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term>
<lb/>I have seen. When at <term type="tribe">the <unclear cert="low">Bakaa</unclear></term> in descending the huge 
<lb/>basaltic rocks to our sleeping place below with the testament 
<lb/>in my hand I felt as if falling &amp; making an effort to save 
<lb/>myself struck my hand so violently against a sharp fragment 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000532_0004"/><!--pb/@n='2v'-->
<lb/>as to fracture a finger bone which rested on the testament &amp; nearly severed 
<lb/>it from my hand. I got a very good splint made of a bit of 
<lb/>reed, &amp; it promised to heal soon. But one night we were aroused 
<lb/>by a lion as near as from your parlour to the opposite side of 
<lb/>the yard. He roared terribly, my ox leaped out among us. My poor 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> shrieked for fear &amp; I half awake siezed a pistol with 
<lb/>the disabled hand fired at the monster but the rebound rebroke my 
<lb/>finger. A few more shots sent him off &amp; when <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> saw 
<lb/>the blood again running they said, "You have hurt yourself but 
<lb/>you have redeemed us by your hand. Henceforth we shall 
<lb/>swear by you". O that they knew the value of the blood 
<w>whi-<lb break="no"/>ch</w> was shed for their souls. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his was worse than the first 
<lb/>fracture after which I had to <unclear cert="low">fast</unclear> nearly two days a circumstance 
<lb/><anchor xml:id="envelopePosition" type="positionMarker"/> which I believe saved me from <unclear cert="low">irritative</unclear><term type="medical">fever</term><reg>.</reg> But as I can 
<lb/>bear a little pain pretty well neither was so bad as you may 
<lb/>imagine. It did not make me rest a single day. I saw some 
<lb/>of <term type="tribe">the Mabalaka</term> who live close to <persName>Mozilikatze</persName>. I sent salutations 
<lb/>&amp; a message to that notorious villian. One took off an armlet 
<lb/>&amp; gave it to me as a pledge that he would deliver the message &amp; 
<lb/>asked me to give him a pair of earings to shew <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> as 
<lb/>a token that he had seen me. I gave him two of my metal 
<lb/>buttons which pleased him much. I shall send this armlet to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> P.</persName>
<lb/>also some cloth of <term type="tribe">the Makalaka</term> which I brought out for her<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I do not tell you the pains I felt to excite your pity. I did feel pain<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>But I felt more pleasure &amp; therefore I do not grudge it in the 
<lb/>least. We have a kind master to serve, there never can be 
<lb/>one more gracious<reg>.</reg> Let us bless him for ever &amp; ever</p><addSpan spanTo="#p2v-01" place="marginright"><!--addSpan/@place='right margin of p2v'--></addSpan>
