<lb/><p>My Dear Friends </p>
<lb/><p><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his is my third but I have not yet 
<lb/><choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> the first I suppose you have written. I am sorry 
<lb/>for it for we start from this place in a day or so &amp; there 
<lb/>is no probability now of my <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> it or any one else 
<lb/>for 2 months hence - Please after this address me "Care 
<lb/>of <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Philip</persName><placeName>Cape Town</placeName>" &amp; not as I last ordered you. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey 
<lb/>will be much cheaper coming through the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'s hands and 
<lb/>I have very different opinions of him &amp; <persName>Mrs P</persName> now from 
<lb/>what I had in <placeName>England.</placeName><choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hey are lovely devoted Christians 
<lb/>&amp; no <unclear cert="low">demencing</unclear> spirit was ever manifested during the period 
<lb/>of my residence under their roof. Everything in their power 
<lb/>was done to oblige us &amp; this is their character from all 
<lb/>the missionaries whose word is worth anything - although 
<lb/>I did not <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice>a letter from <placeName>England</placeName> by port. I was 
<lb/>most agreeably surprised after landing here when I for 
<lb/>the first time opened the box you kindly presented me on leaving, &amp; found a letter with a such a lot of valuable articles 
<lb/>it brought me right home again - all the articles are very 
<lb/>excellent &amp; some very opportunely. I had no workbox 
<lb/>nor slate nor table cloth but what did you mean by 
<lb/>the paper, pens was &amp;c? Was this a sly hint not to 
<lb/>forget writing<reg>?</reg> - you need not have done that for I shall 
<lb/>always consider it a priviledge when my other duties will 
<lb/>allow. I have shewn you proof of this by writing you 
<lb/>even in this short space of time more frequently than 
<lb/>any other except my parents - However you perhaps 
<lb/>did not mean to distrust me. And then the baby clothes 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> W. Phillip</persName> was present when we opened it &amp; on <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> there failed not to exert her <del type="strikethrough">of</del><add place="above">supple tongue in</add> quizzing, <del type="strikethrough">which</del>me on my 
<lb/>celibacy. We had frequent skurmishes before but this 
<lb/>gave her the advantage for a time. I ought to tell you 
<lb/>we recongnised in each other old acqaintances and 
<lb/>truly glad we were to meet in this distant land - I gave 
<lb/>mother the baby clothes by way of "placebo" as we say in medicine 
<lb/><gap extent="3" unit="words" agent="damage"/> our design could not be entrusted to better

<lb/>hands. Good will be done by them &amp; this is what you wanted. With 
<lb/>her husband &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> E. Williams</persName> of <placeName>Hankey</placeName> I made my first essay 
<lb/>in South African travelling.  <placeName>Hankey</placeName> is only about 9 to 10 hours for 
<lb/>this on horseback. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hink of the nature up the roads when it to 
<lb/>us 4 days in a waggon not very heavily laden &amp; drawn by 12 
<lb/>oxen, to reach it. One day however we lost by sticking fast in 
<lb/>a river. I won<reg>'</reg>t detail there things for you have them 
<lb/>in every book of travels in S.A. I felt quite at home for 
<lb/>the scenery greatly resembled <placeName>Scotland</placeName>. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> P</persName> brought back 
<lb/>many associations to my mind, talking of things &amp; persons we 
<lb/>both knew and in the Scotch language - Amongst the wild 
<lb/>mountain scenery sung some songs in the genuine accent 
<lb/>while at some parts unearthly ones were uttered by ugly <unclear cert="low">taboo</unclear>
<lb/>in the rocks above, in denision, I suppose, of the ones of our 
<lb/>people to the oxen &amp; many other things too trivial to mention 
<lb/>gave our trip a sufficient degree of novelty to render it very <del type="strikethrough">inter</del>
<lb/>interesting to ourselves - I enjoyed my first attempt very much 
<lb/>felt very little of that strangeness which I expected to feel in it. 
<lb/>We were all willing to please &amp; <add place="above">be</add> pleased. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Williams</persName> is a most 
<lb/>excellent young Welshman &amp; has done great good in <placeName>Hankey</placeName> but 
<lb/>has been obliged  <del type="strikethrough">from</del> by an affliction of the throat to leave his 
<lb/>charge for the season &amp; retire to the <placeName>Cape</placeName> - A sea voyage being 
<lb/>recommended he came round to <placeName>Algoa Bay</placeName> &amp; feeling much 
<lb/>better resolved to visit his people. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he affection shwen him 
<lb/>by the latter was most interesting. I had no idea that the 
<lb/>Hottentots were so far advanced as I find them. As we approached 
<lb/>the romantic but unhealthy situated spot where the village stands 
<lb/>a discharge of musketry from the first houses made the inhabitants 
<lb/>aware of our approach. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>his was answered by some discharges 
<lb/>from the opposite side &amp; immediately men women &amp; children 
<lb/>young &amp; old were seen running from all quarters to the path 
<lb/>winds down into the valley where the village is situated 
<lb/>joy beamed in every pace as each pressed forward to grasp the 
<lb/>hand of him whom it was easy to perceive they esteemed a beloved 
<lb/>friend - It was not however a boisterous joy. It was chastened 
<lb/>&amp; sober. A hymn was started by the women &amp; their beautiful 
<lb/>clear voices resounded through the whole valley as the waggon 
<lb/>approached nearer the houses. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he expression of gladness 
<lb/>might have been more disorderly - more like what we should 
<lb/>expect from a people lately rescued from comparative <unclear cert="low">barbarity</unclear>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000481_0003"/><!--pb/@n='03'-->
<lb/>but <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W.</persName> since he pacted with them had lost a fine little boy by 
<lb/>death, and they seemed anxious to shew their sympathy with him for 
<lb/>the men had each a little but of crape around their hats &amp; the women 
<lb/>black handkerchief round the head - It was affecting to see one 
<lb/>poor woman who had nursed the boy come forward to shake 
<lb/>hands, her breast heaving with emotion - burst into tears &amp; turn 
<lb/>away from the crowd to weep - As soon as <add place="above">the women had to bake</add> as possible after our 
<lb/>arrival, the people invited us to an entertainment. Coffee in the 
<lb/>morning &amp; tea in the afternoon. Several speeches were made 
<lb/>which seemed eloquent. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he purpose of them was telling us how 
<lb/>happy they were to meet us &amp; that the entertainment was an 
<lb/>expression of respect for us<reg>.</reg></p>
<lb/><p>You kindly offered to do any little thing I might forget. I shall 
<lb/>ask a favour of you but it is not a small one for it will cost 
<lb/>a good deal of trouble. I should have asked <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Moore</persName> to do it as 
<lb/>would have been less for him but I am afraid that before this 
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">will</del><add place="above">has</add> reached <placeName>England</placeName> he will be off to his parents <add place="above">to</add> pay his last 
<lb/>visit. I wish to send £20 to my parents this year, this is not 
<w>sufficie-<lb break="no"/>ent</w> to enable them to emigrate but having to supply myself with 
<lb/>stores of different kinds for some years I can<reg>'</reg>t send more at present<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>I am sorry I can<reg>'</reg>t, but they will I daresay wait with patience till 
<lb/>another year - this sum will serve two purposes, it will free 
<lb/>from a small money debt I owe a kind friend &amp; it will see 
<lb/>them through the winter &amp; make them feel that though far 
<w>sepera-<lb break="no"/>ted</w> I am not unmindful of their comfort. I have written 
<lb/>them about it. Will <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pyne</persName> kindly draw it at the Mission House 
<lb/>&amp; transmit it to them. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Phillip</persName> will draw out a bill in 
<lb/>his name which will prevent any of the Directors wondering 
<lb/>why I send home money so early. It will be endorsed with 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>Pyne's</persName> name &amp; drawn out in his favour. I shall send this 
<lb/>letter to <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Phillip</persName> &amp; you may expect a letter from her with the 
<lb/>bill at the same time. - After this I am ashamed to make 
<lb/>another request viz. Tell my Dear Brother <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moore</persName> if he has plenty of money to bring (or send) a thermometer. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>he plainer the better I <unclear cert="low">append</unclear>
<lb/>this frame will do better than any finer if it is for experiments I broke 
<lb/>mine in coming out while <add place="above">and calculating</add> ascertaining some facts with the temp of cold 
<lb/>blooded animals. He will get one of this sort for 2/6 in "Macreed" I think at <placeName>34 Aldgate</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName>. I don<reg>'</reg>t mean you to do this, you 
<lb/>have done too much for me. Many thanks for all the articles 
<lb/>they were all extremely acceptable. Your kind letter &amp; book &amp; tea 
<lb/>soap candles. I can<reg>'</reg>t name them all but you have my sincere 
<lb/>gratitude for all the baby clothes. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Pyne</persName> has written on 
<lb/>the book. She has an excellent hand. It is a great pity he does 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000481_0004"/><!--pb/@n='04'-->
<lb/>know it. Persuade him to give me another specimen on the 
<lb/>pages of foolscap - No short letters. I have given you a good example 
<lb/>with regard to quantity concerning the quality I shall be silent. </p>
<lb/><p>I mean to write <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moore</persName> as soon as possible but in case I 
<lb/>am unable please <del type="strikethrough">also</del> tell him also. <choice><reg>T</reg><orig>t</orig></choice>hat if he can bring a 
<lb/>quandrant, made to act as a sextant, (having telescope tubes, double 
<lb/>shades &amp;c. I shall teach him how to use it. And afterwards pay him 
<lb/>the full value for it. I hope he will come to <placeName>Africa</placeName>. He may get this 
<lb/>instrument for £4 at "Macrals" - I remember what you did <anchor xml:id="envelopePosition" type="positionMarker"/>in the care of watch &amp; your great kindness then makes me a 
<lb/>little afraid lest you should think that <unclear cert="low">fools</unclear> in need of the above instrument<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Don<reg>'</reg>t think that. I have a quadrant, an excellent one too, purchased from 
<lb/>the above named maker. I mention it to <persName>m<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moore</persName> in order that if 
<lb/>he felt inclined to astronomize a little it would be better to get a 
<lb/>quadrant fitted up as a sextant or a second hand sextant at once<reg>.</reg>
<lb/>Many things can be done by the latter which can<reg>'</reg>t be done by a 
<lb/>simple quandrant - this instrument will assist <unclear cert="low">my work</unclear> a 
<lb/>good deal. I am sorry your kindness has, by my trusting to the 
<lb/>conscience of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Young</persName>, Strand the person who supplied us them
