<lb/><p>My Dear Father</p><!-- The number 18 appears here (circled). It does not appear to be in Livingstone's hand AM -->
<lb/><p rend="center">By the recent arrival of <persName>Monye Mabole</persName>
<lb/>we were favoured with communications from the South 
<lb/>and now by the arrival of <persName>Motseabona</persName> &amp; party from the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> we have an opportunity of returning 
<lb/>you thanks for your favours. We wrote lately 
<lb/>by <unclear cert="low">Aron</unclear> and have now but little to communicate 
<lb/><persName>Monye Mabole</persName> brought 15 out of the 17 <choice><sic>hiefers</sic><corr>heifers</corr></choice> - one 
<lb/>he said had been killed by a wolf near to this &amp; of the 
<lb/>others he could give no account whatever. The <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/>were of opinion that he had made away with both. I sent 
<lb/>him for the horns of that said to be killed by a wolf - he 
<lb/>brought a bone. of some animal or other but not being 
<lb/>a comparative anatomist I could only look at it 
<lb/>as a <unclear cert="low">Motchuana</unclear> does at the stars. I felt a little 
<lb/>angry at first but changed in feeling when I reflected that 
<lb/>I might have lost ten as <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ross</persName> did. and any harshness 
<lb/>on my part might have had a bad effect on his &amp; other
<lb/>minds &amp; perhaps be the means of preventing their
<lb/>salvation. He brought one of his own &amp; two of the 
<lb/>principal men of the tribe here to intercede for 
<lb/>him by means of it. I declined <choice><sic>recieving</sic><corr>receiving</corr></choice> it but 
<lb/>deferred rewarding him till some future time. He was 
<lb/>apparently pleased to get off. and I am sure I am 
<lb/>pleased with your promptitude in procuring the  
<lb/>animals for us - We are out of debt in 
<lb/>so far as animals are concerned &amp; have 
<lb/>placed four of the number to our original

<lb/>stock of ten. We have never been in want of milk 
<lb/>but our old stock is <add place="above">in</add> need of an infusion of new 
<lb/>hands, or rather teats. - this country is favourable for us 
<lb/>in respect to cattle. If you <choice><sic>recieve</sic><corr>receive</corr></choice> any from 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Solomon</persName> for us please send them under <persName>Paul</persName>'s
<lb/>charge or some one else whom you have confidence 
<lb/>in..</p>
<lb/><p>The trees you sent were extremely acceptable. If 
<lb/>you could have spared a few more they would 
<lb/>have <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">been</add> equally prized. We have only two peach 
<lb/>trees now &amp; no apricots. but we hope some 
<lb/>may come up. We have about 10 orange trees

<lb/>trees which we thought of <del type="cancelled"><unclear cert="low">en</unclear></del>grafting but they have

<lb/>have had the new branches knocked off - some 
<lb/>of the country trees we put in the ground <w>with<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>out</w> roots &amp; it is said they will grow - We cannot 
<lb/>bud or <del type="cancelled"><unclear cert="low">en</unclear></del>graft till next year. Do you steep your 
<lb/>tape in gum or what? The superb Claremont 
<lb/>carrots came up splendidly but a swarm of locusts 
<lb/>left their place a blank &amp; we had sown all the 
<lb/>seed sent - Our river has dwindled down to

<lb/>When we came <date when="1847-08"><add place="above">in August or July</add> last year</date> it was a large <!-- Adrian, how do we include the dating code for two months it spans the add tag? HB 7-2-13 -->

<lb/>may be attributed to the great drought of last year

<lb/>We went last week to <placeName><settlement type="village">Lōe</settlement></placeName> for recreation &amp; health

<lb/>the former of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>. As the story goes  
<lb/>he returned into it while men left it but the spoor

<lb/>I have some horns for you - I missed the opportunity 
<lb/>for collecting seeds. The house engaged too much 
<lb/>of my attention &amp; the man who usually does that sort 
<lb/>of work for me &amp; understands what we want being 
<lb/>absent I held on expecting him till the season was 
<lb/>past. Our beads too were at a low ebb. before the 
<lb/>last supply arrived - I am at present collecting some 
<lb/>of the heads of the game for you. Leaving the skin 
<lb/>&amp; under <unclear cert="high">jaw</unclear> entire - I think they will be interesting 
<lb/>at home. <persName>Cumming</persName> intends to make an exhibition 
<lb/>of his trophies in the Egyptian Hall <placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName> &amp; 
<lb/>make his fortune by them - Will the heads be 
<lb/>acceptable as above.? I intend to put up a few 
<lb/>in our lobby if <persName>Mary</persName> will give me leave. to 
<lb/>ornament it for her.</p>
<lb/><p>Am sorry to hear <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName> has been so much reduced 
<lb/>by her journey. Thought her made of a piece of clay 
<lb/>that would not wear out in a hurry. We do not 
<lb/>like to hear her speaking about dying Better if 
<lb/>she were saying Now all our children are away 
<lb/>let us begin a new mission or something of 
<lb/>that sort - Let us go forward. But you will 
<lb/>perhaps say. poor fellow that, all he knows 
<lb/>about it Wait till he feels the infirmities which 
<lb/>creep on our frail bodies.. The complaint 
<lb/>with which she is troubled will invariably if severe 
<lb/>require <term type="prescription">depletion</term>. No matter where the pain

<lb/><p>Monday Evening. <persName>Sechele</persName> sends you a khoodoo's head 
<lb/>which was killed in the town this morning. It

<lb/>these we hope to build a smithy as our next

<lb/>to itinerate somewhere. probably Eastward. Give 
<lb/>him our love if still with you. We are 
<lb/>living in the hope &amp; belief that progress is being 
<lb/>made. Opposition exists but not towards us 
<lb/>It manifests itself in hatred to the gospel. Some 
<lb/>woman or other wished the lion which bit
<lb/>me were here to finish me. but all are 
<lb/>civil We cannot detect a particle of 
<lb/>difference in the conduct of the mass of the 
<lb/>people - <add place="above">towards us</add> which is a cause for gratitude - 
<lb/>they curse <persName>Sechele</persName> very bitterly - He says their 
<lb/>curses are such formerly he would not have 
<lb/>said a word to them - he would have shot 
<lb/>them instantly - The children are returning 
<lb/>to the schools. &amp; the meetings are improving 
<lb/>We have appointed <unclear cert="medium">two</unclear> to converse with the

<lb/>He mentioned his intention of calling his youngest 
<lb/>child <persName>Setefano</persName> in allusion to himself as wishing 
<lb/>to be (like him) the first follower of <persName>Jesus</persName> in this 
<lb/>country - <persName>Mosielele</persName> tried to get one of the wives 
<lb/>while she passed through his place on her way 
<lb/>to her own people. When she refused he issued 
<lb/>a new edict against going to chapel - <persName>Sechele</persName>
<lb/>intends to send over an entreaty to him to allow 
<lb/>his people to attend if they wish it - </p>
<lb/><p>We feel surprised to hear of so many people leaving 
<lb/>the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. We could not credit reports which 
<lb/>came to us about so &amp; so leaving but we now hear 
<lb/>that these persons have actually left and they predict 
<lb/>that many others will follow. What can be 
<lb/>the reason.? If in your place I should feel 
<lb/>inclined to look upon it as an indication 
<lb/>that I ought to leave too. How hard you work 
<lb/>for them, &amp; every thing is supplied for them 
<lb/>that they need in the clothing department &amp;c. 
<lb/>Are they not too well off? Here when I 
<lb/>do a little gun work (&amp; between you &amp; me I sometimes 
<lb/>do more harm than good to a lock) I am both 
<lb/>thanked &amp; paid for it. We are both looked

<lb/>but the people leaving so may render it 
<lb/>needful for you to go through the building 
<lb/>operations of a new station somewhere 
<lb/>else in your district. Now would it not 
<lb/>be well to look at other spheres before 
<lb/>you think of anything else - You may
