<lb/><space dim="horizontal" extent="11" unit="chars"/>I ought to have written
<lb/>you long ago in acknowledgement
<lb/>of your very kind &amp; truly useful &amp;
<lb/>handsome present. It was not 
<lb/>without many a sore tug at my 
<lb/>conscience either, but I have been
<lb/>so occupied that I really could not
<lb/>perform that duty. I was provided
<lb/>with a naval officer to assist in 
<lb/>the navigation of this river, but
<lb/>the gentleman thinking that we 
<lb/>could not do without him took
<lb/>on such airs about the position
<lb/>he ought to occupy though incapable
<lb/>of making the simplest scientific
<lb/>observations that we were obliged
<lb/>to send him about his business.
<lb/>I then became "skipper" myself
<lb/>and as we have been furnished
<lb/>with a badly constructed engine
    
    

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_001395_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>my time has been swallowed up with
<lb/>pursuits I never contemplated on leaving
<lb/><placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. These have prevented me from
<lb/>doing my duty to many of my friends
<lb/>at home. Some of the hard hearted
<lb/>will never forgive me but such
<lb/>I conclude you are not or else you
<lb/>would never have spontaneously
<lb/>served me in the way you have
<lb/>done. I value the revolver very
<lb/>highly and entreat you to accept
<lb/>my warmest thanks for it and
<lb/>for the kindly feelings which 
<lb/>prompted your generous present.
<lb/>I have not yet had an opportunity
<lb/>of trying it on game. I have been
<lb/>too much confined to the ship.
<lb/>but I feel sure it will be an
<lb/>exceedingly useful instrument. The 
<lb/>stock enables one to take a steady 
<lb/>aim and the size of the ball is
<lb/>sufficient for all small animals.
<lb/>About ten days ago we were up the
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">River Shire</geogName></placeName> 100 miles and came
<lb/>among enormous herds of Elephants
<lb/>on a swampy plain through which

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_001395_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>the river winds giving off many
<lb/>departing &amp; re-entering branches. We
<lb/>chased some of them with the steamer
<lb/>and but for an unlucky storm
<lb/>of rain which set in when we caught
<lb/>one in the water we should have
<lb/>secured him. It was too large of
<lb/>course to try a revolver on but
<lb/>some weapon of the kind with a 
<lb/>larger ball would surely have
<lb/>been very effective. We gave him
<lb/>many shots with the Enfield rifle.
<lb/>Then several days afterwards found
<lb/>him lame and plied him with the 
<lb/>same but lost him in the storm
<lb/>twice we were within fifty yards &amp;
<lb/>were very anxious to have him
<lb/>as fuel for our engine. The plain
<lb/>was 20 or 30 miles broad and not
<lb/>a tree could be got near the river
<lb/>The bones of another elephant which
<lb/>the natives had picked clean helped
<lb/>us nicely, hence our desire to get
<lb/>the one referred to. The <placeName><geogName type="river">shire</geogName></placeName> is
<lb/>deep and well adapted for navigation
<lb/>We were the first visitors the people
<lb/>ever had &amp; they seemed very suspicious
    
    

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_001395_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>but brought fowls bananas and cotton
<lb/>yarn for sale. They use bows and poisoned
<lb/>arrows and only once offered to shoot
<lb/>at us. There was something comical
<lb/>in seeing them place their arrows
<lb/>ready to shoot utterly unconscious of
<lb/>the nature of the arms we carried. We
<lb/>had no encounter- never had &amp; hope
<lb/>we never may, but it is well to be <w>pre-
<lb break="no"/>-pared.</w> and thanks to you I am very much
<lb/>so, but still, not so much as to make
<lb/>me in the least desirous of using a
<lb/>weapon against my fellow man.</p>
<lb/><p>This river is filling now and a goodly
<lb/>sight it is to see. A large vessel could
<lb/>now, as I stated at home come up with
<lb/>ease to <placeName><settlement type="village">Tette</settlement></placeName>. I chose the healthy time
<lb/>of year for coming, though that
<lb/>was not the most favourable for
<lb/>navigation, and you will be glad to 
<lb/>hear that my precautions have
<lb/>been completely successful. We have
<lb/>had no fever except among the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Kroomen</term>. You will remember the
<lb/>case of the Great Niger Expedition- the 
<lb/>difference is cause for much <w>thank-
<lb break="no"/>-fulness</w> to the Almighty disposer of
<lb/>events. Please present my kind
<lb/>salutations to your son and believe
<lb/>yours gratefully</p>
