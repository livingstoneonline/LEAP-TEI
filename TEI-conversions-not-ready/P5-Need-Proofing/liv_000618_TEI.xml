<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p>As we are in daily expectation of the 
<lb/>arrival of your better half we feel as if the worse 
<lb/>did not deserve a letter ᅳ This is plain enough is it 
<lb/>not? It is perhaps rather a sort of nervousness 
<lb/>produced by stretching our necks frequently to 
<lb/>see if the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> is in sight that quite indisposes 
<lb/>us to write. We wish heartily she would come 
<lb/>&amp; relieve our suspense May be after all she 
<lb/>is single at supper giving the meat two 
<lb/>taps with her knife before she cuts it by way 
<lb/>of <unclear cert="medium">alagaing</unclear> it to make it more digestible</p>
<lb/><p>A report furnished by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lauga</persName> respecting 
<lb/>the party of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Arkwright</persName> &amp; <persName>Christie</persName> made us 
<lb/>think a little. We saw nothing improper in 
<lb/>their conduct while proceeding Northward and 
<lb/>now that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> returns We have neither seen 
<lb/>nor heard anything which induces us to believe 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Lauga</expan></choice></persName>'s report as having originated in him 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> has been here three days &amp; neither he nor 
<lb/>his people have <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> any disposition towards 
<lb/>illicit intercourse. He is the son of a clergyman</p>

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000618_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>&amp; if there is truth in what <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Lauga</expan></choice></persName> mentioned it must 
<lb/>have been perpetrated by <persName>Christie</persName> &amp; not by <persName>Arkwright</persName>
<lb/>the latter I believe abstains from traveling on 
<lb/>Sunday in accordance with a request of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Ashton</persName> and if he has so much respect for 
<lb/>a missionary as to accede in one particular 
<lb/>he surely would not be guilty attempting to take 
<lb/>a prostitute into his company a deed he knows 
<lb/>would soon be published over the whole 
<lb/>country. We have found him agreeable &amp; kind 
<lb/>&amp; he has during his whole sojourn here behaved 
<lb/>like a gentleman I say this much because 
<lb/>I feel it would be unfair to condemn any one 
<lb/>unless the evidence is pretty strong &amp; decided. Both 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> &amp; <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>Ch.</abbr><expan>Christie</expan></choice></persName> have English servants who have 
<lb/>been soldiers. They may have given <choice><sic>occassion</sic><corr>occasion</corr></choice>
<lb/>to the report above referred to</p>
<lb/><p>We go on much as usual. Walls of school 
<lb/>six feet high ᅳ  Measurement 48 by 20 ᅳ this morning
<lb/>Hope to finish it this month ᅳ We have much better 
<lb/>soil for building where the school is than we had 
<lb/>in this house - A pie<gap agent="fading" extent="3" unit="chars"/> came last week &amp; passed 
<lb/>on to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> ᅳ All is peace But we are 
<lb/>sorry to hear a report of <persName>Cumming</persName> lying ill at the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakaas</term> ᅳ Hope it is not true ᅳ <persName>Paul</persName> was in</p>

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000618_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/><p>jeopardy last week: two Buffaloes attacked a party cutting 
<lb/>reeds &amp; after trying in vain to lift two <term type="tribe">Bakwanas</term> from 
<lb/>the ground ran off ᅳ the men were hurt but will 
<lb/>recover the guns were at a distance &amp; they had no trees 
<lb/>A Hottentot is left here with a broken <term type="bodypart">thigh</term> bone 
<lb/>For two things I can feel <term type="ailment">toothache</term> &amp; <term type="ailment">broken bones</term>
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>A.</abbr><expan>Arkwright</expan></choice></persName> presented me with an excellent gun in its case &amp;c. 
<lb/>He has <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> great likeability &amp; is very thankful for 
<lb/>very small favours ᅳ <unclear cert="medium">Brunghere</unclear> to do all the good we 
<lb/>can it is pleasant to meet here &amp; there with those 
<lb/>who feel that we are of some use ᅳ The Land is 
<lb/>full of <term type="tribe">Griquas</term> seeking their new location 
<lb/>alias filling their bellies with <term type="animal">Eland</term> fat  No new <!-- Not sure if "alias" is correct word in sequence...possibly "alas/also"? HB 10/9/12 -->
<lb/>information respecting the <choice><sic>boers</sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice> ᅳ except that they 
<lb/>are anxious to know where <persName>Mosilikatse</persName> is in order 
<lb/>to attack him ordered <persName>Sechele</persName> to send men to advise 
<lb/><persName>Sekhonia</persName> to find it out for them ᅳ This <persName>S<add place="above">echele</add></persName> does not 
<lb/>feel disposed to do</p>
<lb/><p>I send to you three full grown fruits of the 
<lb/>Mōana kindly brough by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Arkwright</persName>. Will 
<lb/>you when convenient send them &amp; the Thama 
<lb/>to <placeName><country>India</country></placeName>?  The Roots of the Thama dry up &amp; 
<lb/>will not keep</p>
<lb/><p>Am happy to hear you proceed with the translation 
<lb/>Will you put P. I. above Isaiah as I. H. 
<lb/>above Sehela 49 I always laugh when I think 
<lb/>of my hymns. Spelled the new way too sharing the</p>

<lb/><p>fate of Pharaoh's fat kine ᅳ they were devoured by 
<lb/>the lean ones &amp; yet the ill<supplied>-</supplied>favoured are the worst in all 
<lb/>the land of <placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName> still.  Something of the sort will 
<lb/>happen if yours &amp; his are brought with coaptation <!-- Not sure what this last word is? HB 10/9/12 -->
<lb/>How will the following motion in next <choice><abbr>Com.</abbr><expan>Committee</expan></choice> do 
<lb/>"that as certain friends of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>L.</abbr><expan>Lauga</expan></choice></persName> ignorant of the 
<lb/>fact that he took no part in the translation of the 
<lb/>new testament have produced the impression in 
<lb/>the country that he has not <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> his full share 
<lb/>of the honours belonging thereto, We now avoid 
<lb/>the production of a similar impression by 
<lb/>referring his translation of Isaiah to the Judgements 
<lb/>of our esteemed <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> of the French Society"
<lb/>Translate Isaiah by all means &amp; five have 
<lb/>nothing else we can at least compare ᅳ I cannot 
<lb/>see that you should take any notice of his 
<lb/>doings ᅳ  If his own <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice><choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> print it for 
<lb/>him why should we?  Will bad translations please 
<lb/>us more easily than them?</p>
<lb/><p>Is no protest to be entered against the keeping 
<lb/>back of the Directors letter. Was it not <w>con- 
<lb break="no"/>-cocted</w> thus by E. R. &amp; I.  The third triumvirate <!-- Should these three letter abbrevs. be labeled as personal names? HB 10/9/12 -->
<lb/>I feel inclined to abandon the <choice><abbr>Com</abbr><expan>Committee</expan></choice> as a 
<lb/>root of Rotteness - We shall write by 
<lb/>Plaid on &amp; its well - They will soon be here 
<lb/>Our date tree has come up &amp; we expect more</p>
