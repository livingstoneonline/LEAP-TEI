<lb/><p rend="left">My Dear Father</p>
<lb/><p rend="center">By the arrival of <persName>Koulter</persName> on his way southwards
<lb/>we are put in possession of another opportunity to inform
<lb/>you how we proceed in this quarter. I need not say
<lb/>I do so with pleasure I only wish you may enjoy
<lb/>as much in the perusal as I do in the writing. We
<lb/>are all at present in tolerable health But the
<lb/>setting in of the hot season seems to try our
<lb/>stamina. <persName>Mary</persName> is troubled with shooting pains
<lb/>in the <term type="bodypart">chest</term>. Had sore <term type="bodypart">eyes</term> but not severely &amp; is
<lb/>now recovered - She got them from the little one
<lb/>Hope we may through the Divine mercy be
<lb/>favoured with health - We have so much to do 
<lb/>it seems desirable we should but we must
<lb/>be resigned to the will of Him who knows what
<lb/>is best for us &amp; His cause. We feel it hot now
<lb/>we have plenty of Hills behind us, sufficient one
<lb/>would think to screen us from the influence of the
<lb/>Southern icebergs - And all burning <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> spread
<lb/>out before us to the North But we are within
<lb/>the blessed sound of gurgling waters - they have
<lb/>nightingales in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> but <unclear cert="low">of</unclear> all the birds
<lb/>in the world commend me to the merry midnight
<lb/>frogs. You cannot <sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr> yes you can
<lb/>how delighted we were to hear the sound of
<lb/>waters at night, irrigateable water too. In
<lb/>my last <supplied>letter</supplied> I informed you of our removal. <persName>Mebaloe</persName>
<lb/>&amp; I built huts &amp; removed into them <persName>Paul</persName> followed

<lb/>&amp; is now roofing his. Your tent has done him good
<lb/>service - Ours is 24 by 12, &amp; a <unclear cert="high">pack</unclear> house has since
<lb/>been added 10 by 12 <choice><abbr>ft</abbr><expan>feet</expan></choice>, <persName>Mebaloe</persName>'s 16 by 12. <persName>Paul</persName><supplied>'</supplied>s 
<lb/>the same size as ours - the town is still in process
<lb/>of building our corner has a touch of the European
<lb/>for all are square &amp; <persName>Mebaloe</persName> is thatcher to all.
<lb/>Even our man Friday alias <persName><unclear cert="medium">Morukewelo</unclear></persName> has
<lb/>got up one of the four cornered sort &amp; declares
<lb/>he will never leave it it is so beautiful - our
<lb/>plan was to get up temporary houses &amp; a temporary
<lb/>meeting house as soon as possible in order that <!-- There are lines in the left margin of this page beginning here and continuing to the bottom HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>teaching might go on regularly during the time we
<lb/><del cert="high">we</del> should be occupied in making gardens <!-- How should this duplicate "we" be coded? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>We have now got nearly to the point at which we
<lb/>can with good consciences begin to labour 
<lb/>for the meat which perisheth - the chief without
<lb/>any suggestion from me, told me it was his desire
<lb/>to build a house for God - that I should be at no
<lb/>expense whatever with it - He even thought that
<lb/>we should do nothing in the work but to this <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">latter</add> we
<lb/>objected as it was for the worsh<supplied cert="high">ip</supplied> of the God of all
<lb/>I think sometimes that he expects God will bless him for 
<lb/>his good work - Yet he expresses himself occasionally
<lb/>quite in the orthodox style. He wished to build a very
<lb/>fine house but we cannot at present spend more 
<lb/>time on it than making it a temporary affair
<lb/>of pole &amp; reed - He employed all the males in cutting reed
<lb/>&amp; sent them a good distance to select the straightest
<lb/>woods they could find - He began it on Saturday
<lb/>morning &amp; met in the walls on Sunday. Many
<lb/>hands make light work here it was not light work
<lb/>to keep them from doing too much. We made it 
<lb/>40 by 15. We found they had cut the beams too short

	

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000643_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>for our plans &amp; rather than wait for longer put it up at
<lb/>15 instead of 20. On tuesday it was finished except the closing
<lb/>in at the top but the reed being deficient they have been off
<lb/>cutting it today - We shall probably begin to our water cours<supplied cert="high">e</supplied>
<lb/>on Monday next, too late for corn but we may yet have maize
<lb/>&amp; vegetables - Another proposition of the chief is that we
<lb/>make an exchange of work - He takes the watercourse
<lb/>&amp; we build him a European house. We are glad enough
<lb/>to do this for we are but few in number. I intend
<lb/>to give a door, an old one, I may make or sell him
<lb/>a window - We have lost much time in removing 
<lb/>&amp; we have yet to go &amp; get the door frames &amp; <unclear cert="medium">Iron</unclear> in
<lb/>the roof - We shall burn both school &amp; house in
<lb/>order that we may pick out the nails and
<lb/>prevent any <choice><sic><orig>boor</orig></sic><corr>Boor</corr><reg>Boer</reg></choice> taking up his abode therein
<lb/>When we returned we found many <choice><sic><orig>boor</orig></sic><corr>Boor</corr><reg>Boer</reg></choice>s on the 
<lb/>place - Some were rather impudent - dogged <persName>Paul</persName>'s
<lb/>wife <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> she hid herself in <persName>Mebaloe</persName>'s house. The latter
<lb/>has more firmness than the former - All of the  <choice><sic><orig>boor</orig></sic><corr>Boor</corr><reg>Boer</reg></choice>s
<lb/>made off as soon as possible after we came. I did
<lb/>not shake hands with the fellows as I did when among
<lb/>them in our Eastern Journey I felt like the "cock on
<lb/>its ain middenhead". One gave <persName>Sechele</persName> a bottle of brandy.
<lb/>their children employed the<del type="strikethrough">ir</del> time in digging <unclear cert="low">license</unclear> &amp; ran
<lb/>among <persName>Paul</persName>'s children as if equals. - When we came
<lb/>I felt in doubt as whether it was not duty to go immediately
<lb/>with <persName>Paul</persName> &amp; settle him with <persName>Mokhatla</persName>, leaving the 
<lb/>removal <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">of the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term></add> to another year. Since hearing of the above
<lb/>named conduct I fear it might be improper. We
<lb/>were subsequently informed that in our absence, deputies
<lb/>were sent by the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> &amp; <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term> to ask our influence
<lb/>with <persName>Sechele</persName> to grant them liberty to live in his
<lb/>country as independent people. <persName>Sekhome</persName> is now
<lb/>using them in a very tyrannical manner</p>

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000643_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/><p>Although living in their land, since he has got guns he
<lb/><choice><sic>compells</sic><corr>compels</corr></choice> them to pay him tribute. (I shall return to him
<lb/>again) Finding us absent they did not disclose their 
<lb/>object in coming publicly but informed the chief<supplied cert="high">'</supplied>s brother
<lb/>in private, they passed on to the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> &amp; when there
<lb/>were told that I should never return, that I had fled from
<lb/><persName>Sechele</persName> &amp;c &amp;c. The messengers told what the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> said 
<lb/>&amp; on leaving stated they would come again if the <term type="tribe">Sekoa</term>
<lb/>returned - One of the messengers is the son of <persName><unclear cert="low">Shue</unclear></persName> the chief of
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term>, I knew him very well. <persName><unclear cert="low">Shue</unclear></persName>'s wife knows
<lb/>you. The prospect of these two tribes coming nearer
<lb/>made me think of forming a sort of circuit <unclear cert="medium">north</unclear>
<lb/>them &amp; <term type="tribe">Mokhatla</term> &amp; keeping one of our number always
<lb/>engaged among them. but present engagements
<lb/>prevent us from doing anything but at home.
<lb/>We cannot part with <persName>Mebaloe</persName> - He works so hard
<lb/>he is our right hand. <persName>Paul</persName> has never been accustomed
<lb/>to work but is the best theologian by far. We sent
<lb/>a message to <persName>Mokhatla</persName> anent your present but he
<lb/>has not yet made his appearance - It has been 
<lb/>Hurry scurry ever since we came &amp; will be for some
<lb/>time to come. I forgot to mention above that <persName>Sechele</persName> is
<lb/>favourable to the approach of these tribes because they are
<lb/>manufacturers in wood &amp; iron. <persName>Sekhomi</persName> monopolize<supplied cert="high">s</supplied>
<lb/>all the trade in front of him - He will not allow any
<lb/>one to pass him Southwards - There is a good way
<lb/>to the Lake but he keeps it shut as you will hear
<lb/>by the <term type="tribe">Griquas</term>. If <choice><sic>any one</sic><corr>anyone</corr></choice> went past him &amp; opened
<lb/>up the way he would be conferring a benefit on
<lb/>the tribes beyond. When will you go to the Lake?
<lb/>If you <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> next season I may as a relaxation
<lb/>take a trip in that direction. I should like you
<lb/>to go as you have become in a manner pledged
<lb/>to it - I think it would be well if first visited by

	

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000643_0005"><!--pb/@n='3r'--></pb>
<lb/>a missionary. The <term type="tribe">Griquas</term> will certainly reach it next
<lb/>season. Kañkashi is the name for the pole with
<lb/>which they shove off the canoe. I cannot get the word
<lb/>for the paddle whch is used after they have got into deep 
<lb/>water to Row is to <foreign xml:lang="und">hurua go hurua</foreign><persName>Mokhoro</persName> or
<lb/><persName>Mokoro</persName> - <foreign xml:lang="und">go hurua ka likañkashi</foreign> may perhaps <unclear cert="low">do</unclear>
<lb/>the i final is distinctly sounded. <foreign xml:lang="und">Bara</foreign> means to swim
<lb/>the people on the Lake are great swimmers - Lekaoe
<lb/>is the name given to a sort of skiff plaited together
<lb/>&amp; made of Reed - <foreign xml:lang="und">Licobobo</foreign> &amp; <foreign xml:lang="und">Litugiuana</foreign> mean thicket very dense <!-- This had does not look to be in DL's writing? HB 6-19-13 -->
<lb/>of both large &amp; small trees - <foreign xml:lang="und">Mopakoana</foreign> a curtain - a Kaross hung
<lb/>up to act as such - A dreamer of dreams is called <foreign xml:lang="und">Tlorolimpe
<lb/>ki gore torolimpe</foreign>. Will that do for Prognosticator - Island is
<lb/>in <foreign xml:lang="und">Sekwaina Sekiri - Setlapized Seori Setlaka sa gare</foreign> has always
<lb/>reed in it but a piece of land with trees on it in a stream is
<lb/>always sekiri or seori -seori can be applied to a promontory
<lb/>&amp; so can setlaka sa gare but sekiri never. <foreign xml:lang="und">Koñkoñ</foreign> an ignoramus
<lb/>(pelu pahu, I forget at present) <foreign xml:lang="und">Matlurra</foreign> rough, so is <foreign xml:lang="und">Maguata</foreign>
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="und">Leposa</foreign> to drawl in singing or go largely in walking But I
<lb/>must leave words. I am glad however of the opportunity
<lb/>to send out <foreign xml:lang="und">Kañkashi</foreign> - As likewise a riding ox which had I
<lb/>been at home I should have sent by <unclear cert="high"><persName>Boe</persName></unclear>. I have had it three
<lb/>years &amp; it has grown large in my possession - It is very tame &amp; 
<lb/>is easy in riding so I think will just <choice><sic>sent</sic><corr>send</corr></choice> you It has some objection
<lb/>in its own mind to the stick being put into its nose but
<lb/>that operation over it is as docile as possible - the boys
<lb/>here chirp to him &amp; he comes out of the kraal very familiarly turning
<lb/>his tail to them in order to enjoy what learned folks call titillation
<lb/>I hope you will be kind enough to accept it instead of your old one
<lb/>and whatever you may say think or do with it never think of
<lb/>returning it - A dear brother to whom I gave one returned it
<lb/>after it had got its thigh bone broken by telling his herd that ox
<lb/>belongs to <persName><choice><orig>Livingston</orig><reg>Livingstone</reg></choice></persName> - I have got a horse said to have been <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/><choice><sic>Oswel</sic><corr>Oswell</corr></choice></persName>'s Of this I have doubts but it serves to get us eilands <!-- Is this in fact Oswell, or Oswal as in previous letters? HB 6-19-13 -->

	<pb n="0006" facs="liv_000643_0006"><!--pb/@n='3v'--></pb>
<lb/>if it dies I can get another ox. So you need not imagine I put myself
<lb/>about by begging you to accept this - We had <foreign xml:lang="und"><unclear cert="low">horus</unclear></foreign> &amp;c for you
<lb/>but all have been left at the <unclear cert="medium"><term type="tribe">Letlotleñ</term></unclear> - It is now too late for
<lb/>seeds - Your melons will be grown before <persName>Koulter</persName> comes</p>
<lb/><p>We <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>Hume</persName> is done for here - <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Evans</persName> sold a dog trap which
<lb/>I think I have seen in your garden for 30 or 40 <choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice> of ivory - He called
<lb/>it a wolf trap - The first time a wolf got into it the animal <del type="strikethrough">shaked</del><add place="above">shook</add> it
<lb/>to pieces - I suspect <persName>Evans</persName> did not tell this when mentioning
<lb/>how <persName>Sechele</persName> tried to cheat him. We try to obviate the objections
<lb/>which rise up in the heathen mind by such deeds by admitting
<lb/>that there are bad ones among us - At present they have a 
<lb/>high opinion of the integrity of missionaries &amp; we hope we
<lb/>my be assisted to walk so as to maintain a consistency of
<lb/>character. The <choice><sic>pans</sic><corr>pens</corr></choice> you gave me have furnished us
<lb/>with sheep since we came. We have had eilands too and being
<lb/>very fat tried to salt for you but all went bad so you
<lb/>must take the <choice><sic>veill</sic><corr>veal</corr></choice> instead of good <persName>Sehuba</persName> - Buffaloes
<lb/>come occasionally into the town. Two came down our
<lb/>way one morning &amp; we soon made them our own
<lb/>We took a claw hammer of yours by mistake &amp; in using it
<lb/>a few days ago knocked its head off. This is the only article 
<lb/>I know of which should not have come. The reason I used 
<lb/>it after knowing it was yours was it had a smoother face than
<lb/>mine &amp; did not cause the nails to bend so as the others</p>
<lb/><p>I find on application to <persName>Koulter</persName> that he has no loose oxen
<lb/>And <persName>Apie</persName>'s party have so we shall send the ox with the
<lb/>latter. The party with whom <persName>Apie</persName> now is will probably
<lb/>be here next week. <persName>Sechele</persName> has been down to desire me
<lb/>to send you many <unclear cert="low">humerishos</unclear> - Also to all his Friends among
<lb/>whom he considers <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ashton</persName> - He is anxious for <w>some<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>one</w> to make gun stocks for him, many of the guns of his
<lb/>people being much damaged &amp; split - <choice><sic>Some one</sic><corr>Someone</corr></choice> he calls
<lb/><persName>Taote esiũ moreki</persName> has sent messages to him to the effect

	

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000643_0007"><!--pb/@n='4r'--></pb>
<lb/>that he wishes employment in that line - He offers an ox &amp; Kaross for
<lb/>each - Our people say it is one <persName>David Dickop</persName> at <placeName><settlement type="village">Likatlong</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>I promised to mention it to you and that you would mention it
<lb/>to the individual if at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName></p>
<lb/><p>In riding over here from <placeName><settlement type="village">Chonuane</settlement></placeName> I had the misfortune to
<lb/>lose the stopper of my powder horn - could you lend me an
<lb/>old one till I get one of my own.? I am now without any.
<lb/>When we came here. <persName>Sechele</persName> has all his powder (about 100<choice><abbr>lbs</abbr><expan>pounds</expan></choice>)
<lb/>in his tent. The tent was smeared with fat to make it impervious
<lb/>the floor was covered with dried grass and as he always
<lb/>uses candles in the evenings. The candle stick usually
<lb/>stood at the head of his bed - After drinking beer one evening
<lb/>he &amp; all his attendants got up and went with the <term type="tribe">Kotla</term> leaving
<lb/>the candle burning. The wind blew it over on to the grass.
<lb/>&amp; when the flame ran up the tent it was observed - One of my
<lb/>guns being in the tent. <persName><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan cert="high">Sechele</expan></choice></persName> ran in &amp; snatched it up - as he pushed
<lb/>back the flaming tent with one hand it was severely burned
<lb/>The tent was completely consumed but the powder remained
<lb/>untouched it being covered over by some paties. All agreed
<lb/>it was a great deliverance ᅳ We do not know when
<lb/>we shall attain a supply of that article. We do not look for <persName>Cumming</persName>
<lb/>although he has left some ivory with us. He has a <term type="tribe">Hottentot</term>
<lb/>woman with him. Got two <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> to accompany him
<lb/>one of these having gone out to hunt with him was threatened
<lb/>with being shot if he did not find a buffaloes spoor - the
<lb/>man becoming afraid pointed out the direction in 
<lb/>which he believed the animal went but <persName>Cumming</persName>
<lb/>insisted it had gone another way. He then shot one of
<lb/>his own dogs. told the man he should do so to him - the
<lb/>latter again pointed out the direction in which the buffalo
<lb/>went <persName>Cumming</persName> seized him by the throat - beat him with
<lb/>his fists - kicked him on the abdomen &amp; then knocked him
<lb/>down with the <choice><sic>but</sic><corr>butt</corr></choice> end of his gun - this made the blood spout
<lb/>out from his nose &amp; mouth. The two were alone in the field

	

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000643_0008"><!--pb/@n='4v'--></pb>
<lb/>A few days afterwards he ordered the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> to let his horses &amp; cattle
<lb/>alone. He then ordered one of his <term type="tribe">Hottentots</term> to tend them - a horse
<lb/>very soon fell into a <foreign xml:lang="und"><unclear cert="medium">lemena</unclear></foreign> - <persName>Cumming</persName> seized a <foreign xml:lang="und">molala</foreign>
<lb/>in the belief that he had <choice><sic>digged</sic><corr>dug</corr></choice> the pit, one of his <term type="tribe">Hottentots</term> held
<lb/>him by the feet and another by the head &amp; <persName>Cumming</persName> beat him
<lb/>till he expired - I asked the man particularly whether he saw
<lb/>the man was actually <persName><hi rend="underline">gonogile</hi></persName> - He said it was midday when
<lb/>the deed was done. The corpse lay there till the evening and then
<lb/>some of the man's friends came &amp; took it away to bury it.
<lb/>All the people fled when they saw the man actually dead - the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> fled after nightfall - <persName>Cumming</persName> has gone on telling
<lb/>the natives he is going to his friend <persName><unclear cert="medium">Mosilikatze</unclear></persName> - the <choice><sic><orig>boors</orig></sic><corr>Boors</corr><reg>Boers</reg></choice> 
<lb/>have lately attacked some of his outposts and having found he
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> of a different <choice><sic>metal</sic><corr>mettle</corr></choice> from the <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> fought
<lb/>and ran away - hoping no doubt to live and fight another day
<lb/>they say they are returning to <placeName><settlement type="village">ipakauya</settlement></placeName> so say the natives
<lb/><persName>Cumming</persName> does not know of this - If he comes near the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Matibele</term> ten to one if he returns - If he should it will be a
<lb/>marvel to me - <persName>Donovan</persName>'s party died at the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Macapo</term> or <term type="tribe">Bacapo</term> - <persName>Cumming</persName> was South East of them
<lb/>when they (the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>) left him. He seems driven away in
<lb/>his wickedness.</p>
<lb/><p>We have been to measure our watercourse today. Had we
<lb/>time we could irrigate a large tract of land but we should
<lb/>require to go along a <unclear cert="low">mar</unclear> of boulders about 200 feet - We
<lb/>prefer to make an effort for a smaller piece because it
<lb/>can be accomplished soon. And if spared &amp; find <hi rend="underline">that</hi> too
<lb/>small we shall try the larger on a future occasion
<lb/>Immense tracts may be irrigated down below easily - We
<lb/>hope the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> may irrigate for themselves - and
<lb/>they <unclear cert="medium"><choice><sic>profer</sic><corr>proffer</corr></choice></unclear> willing enough to try when they see how
