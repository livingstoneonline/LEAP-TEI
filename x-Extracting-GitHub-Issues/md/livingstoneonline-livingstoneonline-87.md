# [Multiple XSLT Viewer: further adjustments](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/87)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2016-10-31**

Please make the following additional adjustments to the viewer:
1. When we go to mobile, turn off the level 2 image from appearing.
2. The panes are slightly too high. Assuming that the current height is 100%, please reduce to about 90%.
3. Please make the panes slightly wider. See the screen shot below for the two adjustments I&#x27;ve made, but please use your discretion on this. The point is to make it slightly wider.

Overall the tweaks here look good. I&#x27;ve got one more that&#x27;s related, but I&#x27;ll put it with the other changes for the Multi Viewer and so am closing this ticket.
