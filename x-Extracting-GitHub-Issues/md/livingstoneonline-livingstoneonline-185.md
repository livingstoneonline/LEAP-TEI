# [Multitext Viewer: Total width and height of panes](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/185)

The window panes, as a whole, are too wide and too high. 

For width, compare to prod and make them that width or a touch wider, but no more, please.

For height, height should match height on prod exactly.

Height looks good. Width is a bit too narrow. See screen shot. Right now the width of the text field is 483px on each pane. Let&#x27;s make it 500px and we can call it a wrap.
