# [Nav tabs: levels 2/3](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/195)

It seems to me that the nav tabs go to close to the main logo. Please decrease the text in the nav tabs, on the destkop version only, to 15px. This will then allow you to slightly decrease the left and right padding inside the tabs so narrow the width of the tabs as a whole a bit.

After reviewing this, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that we can leave well enough alone on this, so I&#x27;m closing this ticket. Please just look at this ticket so that you don&#x27;t accidentally implement this.
