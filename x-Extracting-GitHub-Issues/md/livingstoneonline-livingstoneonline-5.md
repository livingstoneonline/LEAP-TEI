# [Browse by Catalogue: Sorting by Hidden Fields](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/5)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2016-4-28**

If you sort on a field that is not displayed by default (one that only appears when full record is selected), the order of the columns does not display correctly on the page refresh.

Nigel: Has to do with the split table issue (header is a separate table, I think this should be done from scratch, will take awhile though).

Will be done as part of the re-write of the Browse by Catalogue page.
