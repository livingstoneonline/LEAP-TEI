In playing around with this, it&#x27;s nice to be able to use both orientations, in particular looking at the image looks better in portrait mode, and reading from item details / transcription looks better in landscape.

The latest is up on stage, try it with your phone and let me know if you find use in having access to both orientations.

So I agree with your assessment that portrait allows good viewing of image, while landscape is better for text. So here&#x27;s a question. It occurs to me that one thing that might improve portrait mobile viewing of text is to reducing the padding on both sides.

It doesn&#x27;t have to be in such a narrow column. Alternately, we could do what we&#x27;ve done with the transcriptions and make it wider than the window -- not too wide but certainly so that more text could go on each horizontal line.

P.S. I would also suggest that, rather than flush left, each line of the icons at this level would look better centered.

- In portrait and landscape mode decrease margins for item details and transcription.
- In portrait and landscape mode have item details and transcription 100% wide.

Only on phone
