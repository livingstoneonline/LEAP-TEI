# [Desktop: Section page text](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/171)

The main section page text (and images embedded therein) is too wide on desktop. It should never be more than 716 px.

Also see screen shot. The text starts to narrow prematurely. It should not get more narrow till necessary. In the width show in the screen shot, there is still plenty of room for the text to say at 716px, but it has already gone to something like 620px. In fact, as I continue to narrow the screen, it will get wider again in a moment.
