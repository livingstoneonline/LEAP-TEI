In the Access dropdown, after &quot;View &amp; Download,&quot; we now need an option for sorting &quot;Restricted&quot; items. If you think this will be a quick job, no need to provide a time estimate before proceeding.

Also note that currently, if you select &quot;Download&quot; from the dropdown, the &quot;Restricted&quot; items also come up although, obviously, you can&#x27;t download these. This might be considered a buy and/or require a new ticket -- if so, please open one.

I don&#x27;t think this will take more than an hour.

This is bug (might be a regression from work I did 3 weeks ago) and should have been covered under existing functionality so I&#x27;m moving it to a new ticket (time put into it won&#x27;t go under general consulting).

OK, then feel free to take both these things forward.
