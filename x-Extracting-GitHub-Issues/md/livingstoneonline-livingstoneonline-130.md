There are a few objects that have been out of date for a while on the Fedora server. I&#x27;ve tried various things to update them, but nothing has worked.

Two of the three have been sorted, but it looks like the .tif and .txt file for liv_001219_005 is missing from the FTP server?

I think that the file in question here was left over by accident. It&#x27;s now deleted and this is resolved.
