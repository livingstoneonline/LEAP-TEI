# [Spectral image viewer buttons do not match prod](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/231)

Please configure the buttons in the spectral image viewer (see image below) so that theming and behavior matches prod. It looks like this is a set of settings your forgot to carry over.

Should be sorted now, bug was caused by a change in css precedence due to other recent fixes.

Unfortunately, one more theming pass needed. See screen shot.

Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see that anything has changed. Color dropdown still looks like the same width. See screen shot below and compare with that above. Perhaps you didn&#x27;t yet push up the change?

Should be sorted now, needed to clear the caches.

Looks great. Thank you!
