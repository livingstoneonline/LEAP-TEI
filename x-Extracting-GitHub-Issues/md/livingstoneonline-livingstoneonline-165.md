The home page Livingstone Online logo is too small. Compare to prod and increase the size to match. Note that this is really only need on desktop and perhaps a size lower. Past that, the size of the logo is fine.

Still slightly bigger on the logo, please. Right now it&#x27;s max width 480px. Let&#x27;s make it 500px.

However, note that by this width logo size should drop to 460px for max width
