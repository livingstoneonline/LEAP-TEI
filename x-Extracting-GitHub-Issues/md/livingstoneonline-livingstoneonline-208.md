This looks good, but I see that something is off with padding on the right in the panes. See screen shot, pane on the right. This is as far right as I can scroll over, but you can see that there&#x27;s a bit more on the page.

It was exactly flush with the item details, I&#x27;ve added the same left padding to the right for the item details.
