If you select &quot;Download&quot; from the dropdown, the &quot;Restricted&quot; items also come up although, obviously, you can&#x27;t download these.

Looks good. However, in the Access dropdown, could you make the order of the items as follows:

View
Download
View &amp; download [note the lower-case &quot;d&quot;]
Restricted
No access available
