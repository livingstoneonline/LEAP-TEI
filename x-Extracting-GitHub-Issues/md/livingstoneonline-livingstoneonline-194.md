# [iFrame manual: Width](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/194)

I&#x27;d like to adjust the width of the iFrame. I see that it&#x27;s currently 715px, but the way the page is configured I can&#x27;t further adjust that through the inspect feature (or at least I don&#x27;t know how to do it). Can you increase the width to 800px?

I think this width looks good, so we can also call it a wrap on this.
