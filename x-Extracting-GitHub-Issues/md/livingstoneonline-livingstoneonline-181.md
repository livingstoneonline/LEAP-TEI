# [Desktop/Tablet: Sticky header](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/181)

Right now the sticky header still works the way it does on prod. However, at one point, we suggested that the sticky header would simply be the regular header: i.e. logo, search/browse/share icons, and nav tabs.
