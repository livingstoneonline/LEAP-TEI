# [Theming issue on Firefox in Ubuntu](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/124)

Over the holidays I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my home machine and in using Firefox discovered that there is a minor theming issue with the colored boxes on the home page, specifically, &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;

It looked like this issue also came up on mobile versions. Perhaps this will be addressed by the theming rewrite?
