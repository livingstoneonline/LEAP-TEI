I forgot sync first before pushing up changes, and I&#x27;m afraid I messed something up as there are less files in this repo now, whereas I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to be there. Please review and update this repo as needed.

I&#x27;ve removed the less files, they didn&#x27;t have any affect on anything, no need to worry nothing in the repository is messed up.
