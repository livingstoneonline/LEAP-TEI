Ready for review (although Transcription Team isn&#x27;t implemented yet, we can do that as a separate ticket once we have the details about what we want to render there.)

A few small changes are still necessary:
1) Please change the Directors line to the following:
Leadership: Adrian S. Wisnicki (director), Christopher Lawrence (director emeritus), Megan Ward (associate director), Anne Martin (associate director)
2) In the Cite Item section, 
a) I asked for: [title type&#x3D;&quot;alternative&quot; in quotation marks with period before closing quotation mark] but you&#x27;ve put the period outside of the closing quotation mark.
b) Please put Livingstone Online in italics.

Closing this ticket, since I&#x27;ve combined it with #33.
