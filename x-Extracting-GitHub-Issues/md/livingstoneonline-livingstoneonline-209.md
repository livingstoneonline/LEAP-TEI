Need to manually create the menu for:

http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/in-his-own-words/livingstones-final-manuscripts-1865-1873

http://livingstoneonline.org/his-own-words/livingstones-final-manuscripts-1865-1873

Also the level two boxes for this edition is again not rendering correctly:

What is the issue? It looks the same as it did on stage the previous week (I haven&#x27;t the theme code changed the grid theme code since the last round of feedback on stage).

Is it the height of the last item (it appears taller than the others)?

Looks like it was the image file I uploaded (was the wrong size) should be sorted now.

Sorry, I&#x27;m not clear by what you mean by adding the menu. 

I see two issues, but this may be different from this:
1. The Final Manuscripts edition does not appear in the top menu.
2. All the pages but the home page don&#x27;t have the Critical Edition dropdown.

The other two issues, have been handled as well.

Looks good. Thank you! Note that the Final Manuscripts dropdown includes the &quot;TEI Encoding Guidelines&quot; twice. The first iteration points to the following external page: http://livingstoneonline.github.io/LEAP-ODD/leap.html This iteration can be removed so that there is only the one point to the new internal guidelines page you created.

Yes, looks good. Thank you. If I find any other instances of this once we move to prod, I&#x27;ll just fix this myself.
