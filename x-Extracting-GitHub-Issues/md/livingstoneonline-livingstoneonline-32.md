# [MS Viewer: Arrows and Transcription/Item Details](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/32)

Right now, when the Transcription / Item Details pages appear the arrows at the sides of the page appear below them. The arrows should appear on top of them and should be clickable.

If I understand correctly the arrows should only appear over the image viewer, and not over the transcription text or item details.

That&#x27;s right, though I wonder if we should also put a second set on the transcription text as an alternative way to allow users to go to the next or previous page in the transcription. If that&#x27;s not difficult to add, let&#x27;s try that out. Otherwise, we can take this off the list.

Given that some text will be quite wide and so the arrows would float over that text, I think it&#x27;s fine to take this off the list, so I&#x27;m closing this ticket.
