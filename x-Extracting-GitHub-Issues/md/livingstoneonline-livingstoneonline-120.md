# [Catalogue: Image loading issue](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/120)

> state: **closed** opened by: **awisnicki** on: **2016-12-10**

liv_001696
liv_001957

are both private images and are in the &quot;private&quot; directory and are both coming up as private in the catalogue:

http://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search/liv_001696
http://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search/liv_001957

However, when one clicks on the red circle in the table to see the &quot;Restricted Item&quot; notice, rather than loading, the page freezes and nothing loads.
