# [MS Viewer: Transcription Toggle Button Positioning](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/29)

This button is not quite flush left. It&#x27;s a few pixels over compared to the text.
Also put an empty line between this button and the text below it. Right now the button is too close to the text.
