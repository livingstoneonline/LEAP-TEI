# [MS Viewer: Bottom Popup Spacing and Formatting.](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/26)

1. The items in the bottom popup can be spaced closer together. I suggest a distance that is about half of what it is now. 
2. Also, can we put a little padding above and below the thumbnails, so that they pop up a bit more into the image when you scroll over them?
3. The page number on the bottom popup should not be bold.
4. The background on the bottom popup is currently black. Can we make it white so it&#x27;s more visible that it&#x27;s there in the first place?

Let&#x27;s discuss this. If we decide to remove the bottom strip, then we can close this ticket as the work won&#x27;t need to be done.

Closing this, since we&#x27;re going to hide the thumbnail strip for now.
