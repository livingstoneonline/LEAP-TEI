# [Issue on Prod: Icons not Clickable](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/74)

On all the level 2 pages of the site (i.e., the six pages with the tiles accessed from the colored boxes), when you get down to the mobile versions of the site, the icons (home, key, email, wordpress) are not clickable for some reason. See attached screen shots. Could you take a look at this when you get a moment?
