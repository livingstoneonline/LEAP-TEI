The font size in the facet boxes is too big. Please reduce it to match the size on prod.

Also, could you make the &quot;Clear search/browse choices button&quot; a darker shade of gray so it stands out?

All looks good. However, could you add a touch more padding on the left to the text inside each of the facet boxes? Right now, the text looks like it&#x27;s too far over to left.
