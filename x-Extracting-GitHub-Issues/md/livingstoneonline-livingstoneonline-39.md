# [Browse by Catalogue: Change title](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/39)

Please change the title of this page (http://livingstoneonline.org/islandora/search), including the title that appears on the browser tab, to &quot;Browse by Digital Catalogue Record&quot; (i.e., I&#x27;d like to substitute the word &quot;Digital&quot; for the word &quot;Standard&quot;). Normally, I would do this through Drupal, but even though I&#x27;ve changed the title there, it is not changing on the page itself.

Looks good. Thank you! I&#x27;m closing this thread but can you tell me briefly why I wasn&#x27;t able to change this title myself?

It was/is hard-coded in the theme here:
