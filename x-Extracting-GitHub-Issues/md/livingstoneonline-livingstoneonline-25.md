# [MS Viewer: Show as Overlay](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/25)

Please indicate that the viewer is an overlay by putting a little bit of space around its edges on the right and left hand sides and curving the corners, so that just a little of the underlying Browse by Catalogue Page is visible, as per the way Amazon has it&#x27;s book viewer set up.

This looks great in terms of functionality. I&#x27;m still undecided on the padding issue. Right now there&#x27;s definitely too much. Could you cut the padding to half all around the image? If that&#x27;s still not good, then we&#x27;ll go with cutting out the padding top and bottom as we discussed via email.

I figured out how to test out the padding. Let&#x27;s make the padding on this .5 em and that should be good.
