# [Desktop: Section page arrows](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/172)

The arrows at the side of the screen, on mouseover, give the title of the page to the right or left of the one the user is viewer. However, I believe we previously set the alt text on these to say &quot;Previous Page&quot; (left arrow) and &quot;Next Page&quot; (right arrow). Please restore this wording.

Looks good. Thank you. In reviewing this, I realized that the arrows are missing on the Catalogue page. Can we put them in there? I realize that it will mean narrowing everything slightly. The Access and Creator columns definitely have some space to lose for this. And it looks like all the buttons could be narrowed without any harm. Are there other issues that I&#x27;m not seeing with making this change?

Should be sorted.

The buttons look good thank you! Unfortunately, it looks like you forgot to carry one more thing over: the text that appears above the table when &quot;Full Record&quot; is selected. See screen shot.

And there&#x27;s that implemented. Thank you.
