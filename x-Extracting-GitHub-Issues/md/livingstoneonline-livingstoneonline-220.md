Please restore the &quot;revisions&quot; tab to the back end view of section pages. Here is where it appears on Prod:

It will appear on pages that have multiple version since the site is freshly imported most pages won&#x27;t show the revisions tab since there is only one version, after edits they will appear. For example on this page:
