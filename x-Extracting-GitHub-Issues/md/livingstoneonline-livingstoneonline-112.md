# [Order of icons](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/112)

I&#x27;d like to change the default layout of the icons/boxes in the upper right-hand corner of the page. 

On full width, the current order is: share icons, search box, browse button.

Once the screen starts to narrow, the order changes to: search box, browse button, share icons

I&#x27;d like to keep this second variant throughout, so, in other words, the left to right order just needs to be changed on full width.

This looks good. Thank you. As I mentioned, the proportion of things has become distorted but I&#x27;ll address that in separate tickets as part of a full review of the new theme later, so I&#x27;m closing this ticket now.
