Can you please put a thin gray border around the iFrame as a whole? Right now, it looks a bit odd with just the scroll bar appearing at left and bottom.

This looks very nice. Thanks yet once more! Incidentally, don&#x27;t worry that the title appears both at the top of the page (per normal) and also inside the iFrame. I&#x27;ll soon get around to taking it out of the iFrame.
