# [Multitext Viewer: Text highlighting for dropdown selections](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/187)

On prod, when a date is chosen from the dropdown, the text scrolls to that date and the relevant text is highlighted in gray. That highlighting hasn&#x27;t been carried over to the new version.
