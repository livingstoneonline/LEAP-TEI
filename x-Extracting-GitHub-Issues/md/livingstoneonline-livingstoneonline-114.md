In addition to the outstanding timeline issue (see https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/83), I&#x27;d also like to make the timeline images clickable, so, in short, users would have the option for each item of either clicking on the hyperlinked text or the image.

Looks good, but please have them open in a new tab like the linked text for each item does.

K, now it opens in a new tab.
