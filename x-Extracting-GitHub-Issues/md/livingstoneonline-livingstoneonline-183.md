# [Desktop home page: Width of nav tabs](https://github.com/livingstoneonline/livingstoneonline/issues/183)

On level 2/3 pages, the width of the nav tabs matches the width of the words. On the home page, however, the width of the nav tabs is fixed. To be consistent, we should probably have the width of the nav tabs on the home page match the width of the words, like on other site levels.

This is addressed in ticket #161 so I&#x27;m closing this one.
