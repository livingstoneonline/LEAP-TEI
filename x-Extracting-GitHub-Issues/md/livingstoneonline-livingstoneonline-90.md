Great thank you. Does this mean that the way I tried to update them yesterday on the site by using http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/admin/config/development/livingstone (which didn&#x27;t work, ) will now work?

OK, so two quick question as there are now six branchs to this repo. First, it looks like gh-pages are now in sync with dev/stage/prod. Is that correct? Second, henceforth we are only using dev/stage/prod, so I should ignore gh-pages. Is that correct?

We should always make &#x60;gh-pages&#x60; match &#x60;prod&#x60;, as the downloaded TEI documents themselves will point to the &#x60;gh-pages&#x60; branch.

&#x60;gh-pages&#x60; is a special branch provided by github for hosting webpages.
