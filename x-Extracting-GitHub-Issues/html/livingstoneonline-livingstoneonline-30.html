<li>Please don&#39;t show the title at the top of the transcription since this is available in Item Details.</li>
<li>The text should not wrap so soon. The left margin could be decreased slightly and we could set a right margin so that it does not go off the screen on the right, then have a slider (as you suggested) when the text of a given item is longer and would normally go off the screen.</li>

<p>Set item details to use <code>0.9em</code> font (<code>em</code> is a relative size, derived from it&#39;s parent font size. Which in this case is <code>16px</code>, the default for much of the site).</p>

<li>Looks good. Done.</li>
<li>What I meant is that when the text on a given line is wider that the container for the transcription side, the text wraps. What I&#39;d prefer is that the text didn&#39;t wrap and that when it was wider you got a slider at the bottom in order to scroll over. The slide would work and look (little black ball on a gray line) exactly the same as the vertical slide you already have. Currently, I can set the text to &quot;white-space: nowrap&quot; (do you want me to do that in the updated CSS?), but when I do that I don&#39;t get a horizontal slider. We would want a little padding on the right side so that there was a little white space between the edge of the visible text and the edge of the container.</li>

<ol>
<li>When I open this in Firefox, there is a short delay with out the slider, then the slider appears and the text moves up and to the left so that it is partially out of the screen on the left side. See this letter: <a href="http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search?view_pid=liv%3A000455&amp;view_page=0">http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search?view_pid=liv%3A000455&amp;view_page=0</a></li>
<li>It&#39;s not quite wide enough to the right. In Firefox at least the longest line (line 20 on page 3) is still getting slightly clipped at right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, a question: is it me or does the side to side slider seem to move <em>slower</em> than the vertical one?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is due to the use of <code>margin-left: 9%;</code> used in the <code>p</code> tags in <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline/LEAP-XSLT/blob/c2d3a823aadde84f183df72b64d784c509de67f9/style.css">style.css</a>, basically margin is not being interpreted as part of the width by the scroll bar, I&#39;m looking into a work around, but haven&#39;t found an acceptable solution yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, a question: is it me or does the side to side slider seem to move slower than the vertical one? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least prospectively (the have the same settings). Likely because the horizontal scroll has much less distance to go. Since both the bars content distance are mapped onto a similarly lengthen scroll bar so each unit of horizontal scroll accounts for less movement than the vertical bar in which a single unit of scrolling accounts for a much greater distance.</p>

This button, of course, will disappear when I provide the new XSLT.

Does that make sense? If so, how tall is the top strip? I believe it is 55px. Is that correct? If so, I can put that much padding plus a little more. Should I do that? We could also play around with this when we meet.</p>
<p>In terms of the second point, I could change the margin to 0% if necessary. The only thing to note in this respect is that the small gray line numbers are -4em (or something like that).</p>
<p>In terms of the third point, I guess that is that then unless the horizontal one can be sped up. If not, let&#39;s not worry about that further.</p>

<p>It auto scrolls to the selected page when opening, as the user can open the transcription panel on any page, this is expected behaviour.</p>
<p>For example when the viewer is on the 3rd page:
<a href="http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search?view_pid=liv%3A000455&amp;view_page=2">http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/islandora/search?view_pid=liv%3A000455&amp;view_page=2</a> </p>
<p>If you want the image title only to have no top margin (so no animated movement on open) you could do something like this with the css:</p>
<pre><code>.pb-title:first-of-type {
  margin-top: 0;
}
</code></pre></div>

That&#39;s frustrating. Ok, let me suggest that the easiest thing is simply to cut the line numbers and make left margin 0. It&#39;s not a huge loss and I could also try putting the numbers on the right. Will that do it?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Setting the margin or padding on the left can be done on a parent element of the content, for example this can be handled in the style.css like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.TEI {
    padding-left: 1em;
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>On the right, the longest text is also up against the edge of the window. Can you put a little padding on the right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get padding on the right you&#39;ll have to set it on the actual <code>p</code> tags, otherwise it&#39;s not like to have any affect. For example this can be handled in the style.css like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.p {
   margin-right: 1em;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since these changes should be made to <strong>style.css</strong> I&#39;ll leave them to you, so we don&#39;t end up losing changes when you make other changes to <strong>style.css</strong>.</p>
