            <p>It turns out that, contrary to what was supposed to be implemented, when logged in as an admin I cannot view restricted items. The camera icon appears (rather than the crossed out red circle) but when I click on the given item, rather than images, I get an error page. See screen shot attached.

          <div class="body"><p>This has been sorted, and fixes have been applied to stage and production. </p>
<p>There is a side note though, due to the way that the Fedora Drupal Filter (handles authentication), if a users password is changed they will get this notice (<strong>ONLY ON STAGE</strong>). This is because <em>stage</em> is accessing the <em>production</em> Fedora (which doesn&#39;t share the same authentication system across servers; each has it&#39;s own). In the case of the user <strong>admin</strong> whose password is reset on startup, users logged in as <strong>admin</strong> on stage will see this warning. Other users such as <em>awisnicki</em> or <em>kappaluppa</em> will not (that is unless you change your password).</p>
