            <p>1) The image identification info for each page of the transcription is currently bold, centered, has a semi-colon after the word &quot;image&quot; and has an empty line below it. Please change this as follows:</p>
<p>rend left
no bold
in square brackets
remove semi-colon
empty line above rather than below</p>
<p>2) Please remove the black horizontal line that appears between pages of the transcription.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, in other words, going from one page of the transcription to the next would look like the following:</p>
<p>That, the scriptures of the old and new Testaments, are a revelation of the will
of god to fallen man, this being attested by such evidence as no one with an unbiased 
mind can resist. That they contain a perfect rule of faith and practice. &quot;All</p>
<p>[Image 0003]
scripture being given by inspiration of god, and profitable for doctrines for
reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,&quot; From these we learn that </p>
<hr>
<p>Also a question, would it be difficult to hyperlink the [Image 0003 text] to the relevant image so that when you clicked on the hyperlinked text in the transcription it would call up the relevant image?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>My changes to the XSLT have resolved all of this and so only my question at the end needs to be addressed:</p>
<p>Would it be difficult to hyperlink the [Image 0003 text] to the relevant image so that when you clicked on the hyperlinked text in the transcription it would call up the relevant image?</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible, I might be able to set this up via the XSLT myself.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>It&#39;s not possible via the XSLT alone, as the XSLT won&#39;t be aware of the url parameters so any added links are like to remove the users facets (Genre, etc). It can be achieved via javascript though.</p>
