            <p>Free disk space on the site appears to be running low. In addition, I&#39;m just now importing some new content so it&#39;s going to run even lower. Is there are anything that can be cleared out to give us more space? </p>
<p>There have been a few times in the past when I try to add things to the site, they failed to update, but I noted that disk space dropped meaning that, I believe, they were download for our server to the site but not added, so I&#39;m guessing some of those kinds of files could go and give us space.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Doesn&#39;t appear to be anything we can get rid of. The content is what&#39;s taking up 94% of the 95% of allocated space. That other 1% is necessary for the operation of the site. We shouldn&#39;t push the box above 95% allocation. Seems like it&#39;s time to purchase the extra 500 GB of space to bring it up to 2 TB.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>OK, I&#39;ll look into this, but just to confirm here&#39;s what happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>Over the holidays, I used my Ubuntu 16.04 computer via Filezilla (where I have set the default file type to be Binary, as instructed) to upload a bunch of images to our server.</li>
<li>I then tried to transfer them to the UMD site via the normal process. When I started (to make up a figure) we had 130 GB left, but I ran the update and it failed. Then we had 120 GB left. I ran it again, same result, now 110 GB left.</li>
<li>Then I reuploaded everything from my PC and this time it worked, but now we dropped down to 100 GB. </li>
</ol>
<p>I haven&#39;t looked into (or raised with you) why it doesn&#39;t work from my Ubuntu computer because sorting that out isn&#39;t a priority, but the point is that I only uploaded some small amount of data but because it failed twice it ended up taking much more space then necessary. So I would think that that 20 GB could be recovered. There were probably some similar instances in the past, when we ran into sync failures before.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s the space I was hoping we could recover somehow.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>There wasn&#39;t any temp files or uploaded files that weren&#39;t ingested into fedora lying around on the system, but I removed all our logs and some old backups, to give up 20GB just to get us under the warning size of 95%.</p>
<p>So we currently have 108GB left on the /data directory:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">df -h
/dev/mapper/vg_livingstone-lv_data  1.5T  1.3T  108G  93% /data
</code></pre>
<p>This is broken out across these folders</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">du -hd1 /data
24G    /data/docker
4.0K    /data/ftp
26M    /data/drupal-solr
16K    /data/lost+found
268M    /data/solr
8.6G    /data/drupal
1.3T    /data/fedora
6.9G    /data/mysql
1.3T    /data
</code></pre>
<p>We can&#39;t go any lower than this unfortunately.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Thanks for sorting this out. This creates at least a tad of breathing space, particularly useful as I have a GB or two of images still coming. I&#39;ll look into getting the additional GB soon, but will go ahead and close this ticket now.</p>
