            <p>I&#39;ve reviewed the files.csv file and would like to go with the following structure:</p>
<p>1) Create six main directories, numbered, that correspond to the six sections of the site.</p>
<p>About-this-Site
In-His-Own-Words,
Spectral-Imaging</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>2) In each section, create sub-directories for the pages that constitute that section. Into those sub-directions, put the images that go with each given page. If an image is used for two or more different pages, put separate copies of the image in each relevant sub-directory.</p>
<p>So, for instance, an image from a page in the In His Own Words section, would have the following path:</p>
<p>In-His-Own-Words/The-Livingstone-Online-Digital-Collection/liv_012043_0001-article.jpg</p>
<p>3) In the case of critical edition page, add one more layer of sub-directories.</p>
<p>Spectral-Imaging/Livingstone&#39;s-1870-Field-Diary/Project-Team/liv_000073_0002-article.jpg</p>
<p>4) Finally, for images that are not linked to any given page, create one subdirectory at the top level (same level as the six main sections) and call that directory &quot;Unlinked.&quot; (On prod, you will now find some images that are unlinked to any given site page in just this way.)</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Also, note that for ZIP and PDF files, I&#39;d like to follow a slightly different process. For those files, put them in two top level directories &quot;ZIPs&quot; and &quot;PDFs&quot; (same level as &quot;Unlinked&quot; and the six main sections). All relevant pages, should then point to these two directories.</p>
<p>In other words, zip and pdf files should not be duplicated and distributed into individual page directories.</p>

<p>To make sure we got all references to all files, we extracted them from links (&lt;a&gt; tags) and also image tags (&lt;img&gt;) in this case and in others you have a file embedded in the image tag is surrounded by a link tag that points to the same file, so it&#39;s referenced twice and as such gets extracted twice.</p>

<p>I also see a folder for Filedepot, but no files in it. However, I see that the &quot;private&quot; folder has the Filedepot files. How will this work? I see that I can&#39;t access it via the usual method of just adding &quot;filedepot&quot; to the end of the home page URL.</p>
<p>Where are the ZIP and PDF files, and unlinked images, which I&#39;d asked to have in separate directories above?</p>
<p>Above, I&#39;d asked to have critical edition pages be in one more set of subdirectories. So, for instance, in the main spectral imaging directory, you&#39;d just have an 1870 Field Diary directory, and then all the pages for that edition would be in subdirectories of the main one. Since you haven&#39;t set that up, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s not feasible?</p>

<p>Drupal will create some folders and files, it&#39;s best not to delete them, lest they cause some bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the styles folder being used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are generate by Drupal, it applies styles for particular views of images (croping or resizing images, etc). Best not to edit this folder directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also see a folder for Filedepot, but no files in it. However, I see that the &quot;private&quot; folder has the Filedepot files. How will this work? I see that I can&#39;t access it via the usual method of just adding &quot;filedepot&quot; to the end of the home page URL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Filedepot is a tool that is no longer in use so these folders could be deleted safely. The private folder is a Drupal folder for non-public files (files that are only accessible to authenticated users). The files in the folder &quot;private/filedepot&quot; are not referenced by any of the section pages, it&#39;s likely they are not used anywhere, and could be safely deleted, unless of course you wish to leave them on as a sort of backup).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are the ZIP and PDF files, and unlinked images, which I&#39;d asked to have in separate directories above?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The staging server does not have enough space for all of these files so they are stripped out. They will be available on production though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above, I&#39;d asked to have critical edition pages be in one more set of subdirectories. So, for instance, in the main spectral imaging directory, you&#39;d just have an 1870 Field Diary directory, and then all the pages for that edition would be in subdirectories of the main one. Since you haven&#39;t set that up, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s not feasible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not feasible. You can move them around afterwards manually though (after the move to production) if you see fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a way to upload more than one file at once?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is now, I&#39;ve just added this functionality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we add a search box?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes I&#39;ve just added this functionality.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We can set that up for production, after the move.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Re: Filedepot, I think then that we can delete the main Filedepot directory (that is empty). </p>
<p>The private folder with Filedepot files, however, I&#39;d like to keep. Indeed, this is not referenced anywhere in the site, but include documentation, such as permissions etc. Before we overwrite prod, I&#39;ll make sure I have all the Filedepot files from prod (what&#39;s on private at present is a bit disoraganized).</p>
<p>Re: ZIP &amp; PDF sounds good.</p>
<p>Re: Critical ed subdirectories, no prob.</p>
<p>Re: Upload and Search functionality, look good. For search, can we have partial search, i.e., so that if I enter only the first part of the name I get some results? Right now, it looks like it&#39;s only exact match or nothing. </p>
<p>Finally, note that the theming on upload and search is slightly off, see below.</p>

<p>That would be out of scope, I didn&#39;t implement this functionality; It&#39;s simply what&#39;s provided by a contrib module.</p>

<p>Updating the look would be out of scope this is only viewable by you (it&#39;s not public). We are not maintaining or modifying this module.</p>
