            <p>This is the same issue that came up before. The title on level 3 pages is visible, but if you click a link that&#39;s anchored to a place lower down on the page, then scroll back up, the title is gone. </p>
<p>You of course got this close to working, it was fine, then I noticed the other day that the issue had returned. I went into the back end, fixed it exactly as you did (oddly the setting had changed since you set it up correctly), but this time changing the settings didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t have to work perfectly -- if, say, the title simply moves closer to the carousel that will be OK -- but the title can&#39;t be disappearing as now.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Looks good! It looks like we&#39;re back to the original solution, which was not 100% but does the trick. Is that right? Let me know in case this issue comes up again.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Yup same solution as before, it came back because it was in one of the features which got reapplied (reintroducing the issue again). I&#39;ve removed it from the feature so it shouldn&#39;t crop up again.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Nigel, could you fix this issue on stage. It&#39;s cropped up there. Please don&#39;t just copy down the prod database to stage as we&#39;re in the process of developing new content in stage so we don&#39;t want that overwritten. </p>
