            <p>This issue relates to the colored buttons on levels 2 and 3 that lead to the main sections of the site. The issue is that when you mouse over these buttons, they do not always seem to be hyperlinked and it is possible to mouseover the hyperlinked text with it remaining unclickable and the pointer remaining as an arrow rather than changing into a hand. </p>
<p>This eventually resolves itself if you keep moving the pointer up and down over the colored button, but if a user doesn&#39;t know to do that, then they may think that the link is broken.</p>
<p>I&#39;d also suggest that instead of having just the text be hyperlinked, we make it so that the whole colored button is hyperlinked &amp; clickable.</p>
