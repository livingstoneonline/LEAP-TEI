I think this looks great overall, except there&#39;s one small spot where the search button is way over from the search bar. See screen shot. Perhaps that this point, the search bar could be extend to the button?  Also, the distance of the downward pointing right arrows on the right side of the Year, From, and To dropdowns in not the same as on the other dropdowns and it becomes very obvious in the mobile view. Please put all of these downward arrows the same distance from the right side. Once you do those two things, then please feel free to close this ticket.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Yes, that did the trick. However, when reviewing this I noticed two further things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The title of the page (Browse by Digital Catalogue) disappears at a certain point. This should not happen rather the title should behave like the other titles on comparable pages of the site. See for example: <a href="http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-site/livingstone-online-introduction">http://livingstonestage.lib.umd.edu/about-site/livingstone-online-introduction</a> (Note that the size stays fairly the same for a while as the browser narrows, then the size of the title gets smaller.)</li>
<li>When the title is still there, it&#39;s wrapping sooner than it should. See attached screen shot.
