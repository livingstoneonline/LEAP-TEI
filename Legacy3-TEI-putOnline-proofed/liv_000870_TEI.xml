<lb/>in the departure of your most excellent

<lb/>and as I have always since my attendance
<lb/>on his theological lectures and ministry
<lb/>regarded him with very great affection
<lb/>I think of his removal with unfeigned
<lb/>sorrow. May God grant us grace to
<lb/>follow in his footsteps. Unquestionably
<lb/>he served God in his day and generation
<lb/>with rare abilities and unswerving devotion
<lb/>through good &amp; through bad <unclear cert="medium">reports</unclear>. When
<lb/>such are removed we feel somewhat
<lb/>nearer to the grave. There seems to be
<lb/>nothing now between it and us. May
<lb/>we <unclear cert="medium">live</unclear> to Christ and for the prosperity

<lb/><p>I believe I did not refer very
<lb/>pointedly to what may be called <term type="occupation">missionary</term>
<lb/>prospects in this region. And the reason is
<lb/>I feel perplexed on one point <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan cert="high">videlicet</expan></choice> the
<lb/>insalubrity of the climate. It is no obstacle
<lb/>to myself personally. I think no <orgName><placeName><settlement type="city">London</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>society</orgName>'s "<orgName><unclear cert="medium">zendeling</unclear></orgName>" worth his salt. would
<lb/>bolt at that. Even though we have
<lb/>no law against cowardice (<foreign xml:lang="la">vide</foreign> the 2<hi rend="sup">d Art.</hi>
<lb/>of the <orgName>Bushman</orgName> commando mighty men
<lb/>of valour) most of our fellows must
<lb/>feel in the same way. And my better
<lb/>half would go as readily as any one. But
<lb/>I am not clear on exposing my
<lb/>little ones without their own intelligent
<lb/>self dedication. As far as opportunity
<lb/>goes there is no lack. There are tribes
<lb/>and villages without number to the <placeName><region>North</region></placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName><region>East</region></placeName> of this and all would be proud
<lb/>of the presence of a <orgName>white man</orgName>. I
<lb/>know of no hindrance to <term type="occupation">missionary</term> operations
<lb/>in any part of the country <placeName><region>North of

<lb/>of commerce extending its ramifications

<lb/><placeName><geogName type="island">Zanzibar</geogName></placeName> who takes charge of a <orgName>party of
<lb/><term type="tribe">Makololo</term></orgName> with ivory for <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>. When
<lb/>they return <orgName>my <unclear cert="low">late</unclear> companions</orgName> will
<lb/>be ready to start again. So one relay will
<lb/>always be abroad on business. Before
<lb/>my trip the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> never visited another
<lb/>tribe except to <term type="occupation">plunder</term>. They have not
<lb/>given this trade up yet, for two forays
<lb/>were made during my absence. (not being 
<lb/>in the country I did not lend my pot <del type="strikethrough">again)</del>
<lb/>What a mercy, the "ill report" <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> be
<lb/>retailed in <orgName>Government House</orgName> again)
<lb/>But <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">the</add> remedy for that and every evil
<lb/>is being applied. The blessed word of
<lb/>the living God has been <term type="occupation">preached</term> though
<lb/>in much weakness - and the prayers
<lb/>of <orgName><choice><sic>Gods</sic><corr>God's</corr></choice> people</orgName> are ascending as incense
<lb/>before the throne of the Hope of <placeName><country>Israel</country></placeName>, <del type="strikethrough">and</del>
<lb/>the time is coming, the set time, when
<lb/>all nations shall call Him blessed.</p>
<lb/><p>I have been guilty of some innocent
<lb/>wonderment in seeing it stated in terms
<lb/>lugubrious enough that the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> and <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> &amp;c were not a
<lb/>whit better for all our labours, nay
<lb/>much worse. I followed the rule <choice><sic>invaribly</sic><corr>invariably</corr></choice>
<lb/>of making no enquiries respecting the
<lb/>labours or conduct of other <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>
<lb/>among <orgName><hi rend="underline">natives</hi></orgName> and therefore can say



	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000870_0004"><!--pb/@n='2v'--></pb>
<lb/>nothing about <term type="tribe">Bahurutse</term> or <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>. But
<lb/>about the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> the verdict would I most
<lb/>sincerely think, require reconsideration. During
<lb/>the whole of our sojourn there we strove so to
<lb/>conduct ourselves as that there should be no
<lb/>cause of offence except concerning the law
<lb/>of our God. I feel humbly and heartily
<lb/>thankful to our Heavenly father for enabling
<lb/>us to effect this. <unclear cert="medium">This</unclear> is a point of
<lb/>vital importance in estimating what <choice><sic>his</sic><corr>has</corr></choice>
<lb/>been effected among a people. So when
<lb/>we left we had not one single enemy
<lb/>in the whole tribe x and even when the
<lb/><choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> was inspanned on our departure
<lb/>for <placeName><region><persName>Sebituane</persName>'s country</region></placeName>. <persName>Sechele</persName> and
<lb/><orgName>his principal <add place="above">men</add></orgName><add place="below">^</add> tried to persuade me
<lb/>to remove to the (afterwards) scene of the
<lb/>massacre of <orgName>his people</orgName>, offering to build
<lb/>a house and church free of <choice><orig>expence</orig><reg>expense</reg></choice>.
<lb/>I need not refer to my reasons for
<lb/>refusing - (I am perfectly satisfied as to their
<lb/>validity) except that the principal one was
<lb/>determined hostility to the requirements
<lb/>of the <bibl>gospel</bibl> unmixed with any hostility
<lb/>to ourselves. Some may think this

<lb/>hostility to the <bibl>gospel</bibl> evidence of <w>deterior-
<lb break="no"/>ation</w> from their state of heathenism
<lb/>I believe it to be a most important
<lb/>step in advance from that state.
<lb/>for though they refuse to bow in
<lb/>humility to the Divine law, the truths
<lb/>they have imbibed exert a most
<lb/>salutary influence on their morals *
<lb/>I know this to be a fact - a plain
<lb/>palpable fact. And if any one
<lb/>doubts it. As he cannot compare
<lb/>what the <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> were with what
<lb/>they are let a comparison be
<lb/>made between the <term type="tribe">Makololo</term> and
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwains</term>. Why in <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">coming from <term type="tribe">Makololo</term></add> meeting with

<lb/>I had entered civilized life, I
<lb/><choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> wonder at it. The word of
