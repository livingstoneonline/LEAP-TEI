<lb/>mentioned my plans so often I <w>un-

<lb/>I had a severe spell of trudging on

<lb/>my preaching conversation and

<lb/>the spread of the <bibl>gospel</bibl> as the <orgName>Boers</orgName>
<lb/>would allow them to be. The plan

<lb/>I <choice><sic>percieve</sic><corr>perceive</corr></choice> that I was performing
<lb/>good service to the cause of Christ    
<lb/>I wrote to my brother that I would
<lb/>perish rather than fail in my

<lb/>I have done but the wonderful
<lb/>mercies I have <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> will constrain
<lb/>me to follow out the work in spite
<lb/>of the veto of the <orgName>Board</orgName>. If it is

<lb/><p>I <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> all the articles sent

<lb/>bedding stockings &amp;c. were most

<lb/>before they were needed. Some
