<lb/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>On the <date when="1842-02-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of February</date> last I left this station and having
<lb/>proceeded into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> of the <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> Country</region></placeName> remained there
<lb/>during the months <date when="1842-03">March</date>, <date when="1842-04">April</date>, <date when="1842-05">May</date>, and part of <date when="1842-06">June</date>.
<lb/>The whole of that period was characterised by the continued manifestation
<lb/>of the Divine goodness towards me and now with humble gratitude to 
<lb/>Him whose Providential care watched over and brought me back
<lb/>in safety, I shall endeavour to state to you the objects for which 
<lb/>this journey was undertaken and the manner in which they were
<lb/>followed out. The objects I had in view were the following ᅳ </p>
<lb/><p>That I might by exclusive intercourse with the <orgName>natives</orgName>
<lb/>facilitate my labour in the acquisition of the language, ᅳ that
<lb/>I might for a season be freed from all attention to medicine ᅳ
<lb/>And that, though still but imperfectly acquainted with their
<lb/>tongue, I might make an effort for the eternal welfare of the
<lb/>tribe or tribes with whom I should sojourn by means of
<lb/><orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">agents</term>.<space extent="6" unit="chars"/> In order the more effectually to carry
<lb/>into operation the last &amp; principal object I had in contemplation
<lb/>I took with me two <orgName>natives</orgName>, <orgName>members</orgName> of the church in
<lb/>this place. And with two others connected with the
<lb/>management of the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> we proceeded in a
<lb/>direction nearly North East of <placeName><settlement type="village"><unclear cert="low">Moteeto</unclear></settlement></placeName><!-- looks to be Moteeto, AJS -->. This route brought
<lb/>us near to more of the tribes which lie <placeName><region>East</region></placeName> and <placeName><region>West</region></placeName> of
<lb/>it. And consequently we saw no people save a few of
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bakalihari</term> and <orgName>Bushmen</orgName> until after twelve days
<lb/>travelling we arrived in the valley of the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>. There
<lb/>we saw three villages, each of which may be stated to
<lb/>contain a population of 400 souls. The situations of
<lb/>these are very inviting for the valley is both beautiful
<lb/>and large. Not less I think than forty miles in length
<lb/>and from two to four in breadth. And besides <w>abund-
<lb break="no"/>-ance</w> of iron-stone, it contains no fewer than seven
<lb/>fountains each of which pours out a copious supply
<lb/>of excellent water</p>
<lb/><p>As the <orgName>people</orgName> however are the sole <term type="occupation">manufacturers</term> of
<lb/>the iron and wooden utensils in use among the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>
<lb/>and in trading pass among all the tribes to the <placeName><region>Southward</region></placeName>
<lb/>I thought it probable that they may have imbibed some
<lb/>of the prejudices to the <bibl>gospel</bibl> which prevail to such a  
 
                

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000511_0002"><!--pb/@n='2'--></pb>
<lb/>a lamentable extent among these, and consequently might not be in
<lb/>such a favourable state for the operations of <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term> as some
<lb/>tribes which live still farther to the <placeName><region>North</region></placeName>. We therefore only
<lb/>remained a few days with them. Their behaviour to us was
<lb/>however as kind as we could have expected. We found no
<lb/>difficulty in collecting them together, and when we addressed 
<lb/>them on salvation by <persName>Christ</persName> they listened with respectful
<lb/>attention. I earnestly hope the time is not far distant when they 
<lb/>shall hear statedly and with believing hearts the glad tidings
<lb/>of mercy ᅳ</p>
<lb/><p>Nearly directly <placeName><region>North</region></placeName> of the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term> and a little more than
<lb/>one hundred miles distant, lives <persName><unclear cert="medium">Bubi</unclear></persName>, one of the <term type="occupation">chiefs</term> of the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term>(<term type="tribe">Baquane</term>)and one of the most sensible of his <orgName>class</orgName>
<lb/>I have yet seen. To him we next proceeded, and the very
<lb/><choice><sic>freindly</sic><corr>friendly</corr></choice> reception <persName>M<hi rend="sup underline">r</hi> Edwards</persName> and I met with from both him
<lb/>and <orgName>his people</orgName> last year, the very favourable character he
<lb/>bears among all the tribes, and the fact that <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi><choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>Edwards</expan></choice></persName> found them
<lb/>entirely ignorant of the <bibl>gospel</bibl>, induced me to prefer <w>mak-
<lb break="no"/>-ing</w> a commencement for a <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teacher</term> with them.</p>
<lb/><p>The beginning of the school for the children was as favourable
<lb/>as we could desire. The <term type="occupation">chief</term> expressed much joy at the
<lb/>thought of having the <orgName>foreigners</orgName> as his friends and went
<lb/>himself and collected the children. He supplied me with <term type="foodstuff">milk</term>
<lb/>regularly, and when payment was offered he promptly declined
<lb/>His <term type="occupation">under chiefs</term> continued to supply <orgName>my people</orgName> with food
<lb/>during most of our stay and although the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> attracted
<lb/>crowds of <term type="occupation">visitors</term> daily on no occasion did we miss
<lb/>a single article ᅳ <space dim="horizontal" extent="6" unit="chars"/>Not long after our arrival it occurred 
<lb/>to me that it would be advantageous if we could lead out
<lb/>for <term type="occupation">irrigation</term> the fine stream which winds round the
<lb/>foot of the hill on which their town is built. And this
<lb/>because it would both furnish the <term type="occupation">teacher</term> with an
<lb/>available garden and also help to convince the <orgName>people</orgName>
<lb/>that they might by a little industry render themselves <choice><sic><w>independ-
<lb break="no"/>-ant</w></sic><corr>independent</corr></choice> of those impostors called "<term type="occupation">Rain Makers</term>". I accordingly
<lb/>explained to the <term type="occupation">chief</term> and his <orgName>principal men</orgName> our mode of 
<lb/><term type="occupation">irrigation</term> and was glad to find that they were quite
<lb/>delighted with the idea. The <term type="occupation">chief</term> said he would send
<lb/>as many men as it needed, if I should only <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice>
<lb/>them how to do the work (two of those he sent <del type="strikethrough">were</del> are
<lb/>his principal <term type="occupation">underchiefs</term> &amp; another <del type="strikethrough">was</del> is his own favourite
<lb/><term type="occupation">doctor</term> or <term type="occupation">rain maker</term>.) I had not thought of engaging

      

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000511_0003"><!--pb/@n='3'--></pb>
<lb/>in a work of this nature when I left <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> &amp; had none of the
<lb/>necessary implements with me, But seeing it would not do to lose the
<lb/>favourable season when all were eager to work, I commenced with
<lb/>such as I could invent, Sticks sharpened to a point served for
<lb/><term type="occupation">digging</term> a canal between four &amp; five hundred feet in length, three
<lb/>in width, and in some places more than four in depth; the earth
<lb/>was lifted out in handfuls and carried to the dam in karosses<supplied cert="high">,</supplied>
<lb/>wooden bowls and tortoise shells. This information I am quite
<lb/>aware is not strictly connected with the great object for which I
<lb/>have been sent to the <orgName>heathen</orgName>, But I mention these particulars
<lb/>because I am by them induced to indulge the hope that they are
<lb/>indicative of a better state of things among this <orgName>people</orgName> than
<lb/>what the early <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> found among the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term>, and
<lb/>if so, if all the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> who are sent to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>
<lb/>are allowed to devote their energies exclusively towards the 
<lb/>amelioration of the spiritual condition of the <orgName>people</orgName>.
<lb/>May we not hope that thereby the chariot of the everlasting
<lb/><bibl>gospel</bibl> will go on with accelerated speed <del type="strikethrough">untill</del> and the
<lb/>whole country soon be enlightened by the glory of the 
<lb/>Lord. ᅳ The <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> surprising industry
<lb/>and perseverence in this work, and such I conceive as
<lb/>warrants me to indulge the hope I have stated above,
<lb/>for although the dam was twice swept away by floods,
<lb/>and I was unable, in consequence of getting both legs and
<lb/>arms severely sunburned, to stimulate them by my
<lb/>example, they did not seem in any way discouraged
<lb/>but laboured on to the end.<space dim="horizontal" extent="6" unit="chars"/>I sincerely regret to
<lb/>add that I have been unable to try the experiment whether
<lb/>this favourable beginning would have continued, for in
<lb/>consequence of great weakness the effect of a violent
<lb/>fever with which the <term type="occupation">teacher</term> I intended to leave with
<lb/>them was affected, I was obliged to bring him away
<lb/>and no continued efforts for the good of this interesting
<lb/><orgName>people</orgName> are at present being made. At this period it
<lb/>would have given me the greatest satisfaction to have
<lb/>known what are the intentions of the <orgName>Directors</orgName> in relation
<lb/>to <orgName>native</orgName> agency and this mission But unfortunately
<lb/>no instuctions have yet arrived ᅳ</p>
<lb/><p>Having remained with the <orgName>people of <persName>Bubi</persName></orgName> for nearly a <!-- Bubi was termed as a personal name above- could it also be tribe like tagged here, or still personal name? HB 5-1-13 --><!-- I have changed it to a persName AM -->
<lb/>month I proceeded Northward in order to visit the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>, <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term>
<lb/>and <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term>, three tribes having their countries in <choice><abbr>Lat.</abbr><expan>Latitude</expan></choice> 22° <choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice>
<lb/>and streching from 28° to 30° <choice><abbr>E.</abbr><expan>East</expan></choice><choice><abbr>Long.</abbr><expan>Longitude</expan></choice>. The last named is
<lb/>the smallest of the three, but it is a section of a <orgName>people</orgName> of

      

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000511_0004"><!--pb/@n='4'--></pb>
<lb/>very considerable numbers and who speak a language differing very
<lb/>decidedly from the <term type="tribe"><unclear cert="medium">Sitchuana</unclear></term>. More of the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> I had with me
<lb/>could understand it, But from some of the words which I caught,
<lb/>I am inclined to think it belongs to the same root with their Tongue
<lb/>Their manners too are somewhat different from the <orgName>Southern 
<lb/>tribes</orgName>, inasmuch as they are not entirely dependant on the rude
<lb/>Kaross for covering, but <term type="occupation">manufacture</term> cotton cloth for <del type="strikethrough">shal</del>
<lb/>shawls &amp;c. And besides the knowledge how to <term type="occupation">manufacture iron
<lb/>and copper</term> one of the five tribes into which the <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term>
<lb/>are divided, called the <term type="tribe">Mashona</term>, fight with guns, instead of
<lb/>the assagai. These they obtain from the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> on the
<lb/>Eastern coast, and from some circumstances which have
<lb/>come to my knowledge, I am inclined to believe they procure
<lb/>them in exchange for <orgName>slaves</orgName>. By conversation with
<lb/>many different individuals and these of different grades I
<lb/>ascertained the existence of no fewer <del type="strikethrough">tribes</del> than 28 tribes
<lb/>of people hitherto unknown to <orgName>Europeans</orgName>, thirteen of
<lb/>these are reported to have another tongue and the remainder 
<lb/>speak <unclear cert="medium">Stichuana</unclear> But as reports cannot (however carefully
<lb/>examined) be absolutely depended on I shall turn to
<lb/>those which I myself visited ᅳ</p>
<lb/><p>Our route to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> skirted the sandy desert which
<lb/>flanks the <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> country</region></placeName> to the <placeName><region>Westward</region></placeName>, and, as the sand
<lb/>proved <del type="strikethrough"><gap extent="3" unit="chars"/></del><add place="below">˄</add> <add place="above">very</add> fatiguing for the <term type="animal">oxen</term>, <del type="strikethrough">so that</del> when within 40 or
<lb/>50 miles from that <orgName>people</orgName>, they were unable to proceed farther,
<lb/>and I had to leave both <term type="animal">oxen</term> and <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> and perform
<lb/>my visit on foot. But I had not the least reason to
<lb/>regret having done so, for the <term type="occupation">chief</term> (<persName>Sekomi</persName>) was
<lb/>evidently pleased that I had thrown myself on his bounty
<lb/>without the least appearance of distrust. Indeed before
<lb/>I had been 10 minutes in his company and while sitting <!-- There seems to be a strikethrough and addition not in DL's hand above the number 10, reading "ten" HB 5-1-13 -->
<lb/>surrounded by hundreds of his <orgName>people</orgName> he began to <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice>
<lb/>his satisfaction by feeding me with the flesh of the <!-- There seems to be a strikethrough and addition not in DL's hand above "the", reading "a" HB 5-1-13 -->
<lb/><term type="animal">Rhinoceros</term> and some other things which they consider
<lb/>dainties. He then took me to the house of his mother
<lb/>presented me with a large <choice><sic><term type="animal">elephant</term>s</sic><corr><term type="animal">elephant</term>'s</corr></choice> tusk, more food, <!-- There seems to be an addition not in DL's hand after "tusk", reading "and" HB 5-1-13 -->
<lb/>and, as we became better acquainted, he frequently and
<lb/>emphatically exclaimed "you have come to us just like
<lb/>rain". And "if you had brought your <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> I should
<lb/>have detained you at least a month looking at you" ᅳ
<lb/><persName>Sekomi</persName> has <orgName>a large number of people</orgName> under him,
<lb/>in the town alone I numbered 600 houses which is
<lb/>a number considerably larger than I have been able to count <!-- There are more strikethroughs on this and the previous line not in DL's hand HB 5-1-13 -->

<lb/>in any other <term type="tribe">Bechuana</term> town in the country. But they are all very small and
<lb/>cannot contain many individuals each. The one in which I lived was
<lb/>quite as large as any in the town and three of us could not sleep in it
<lb/>without touching each other, unless we put out our fire ᅳ The
<lb/><orgName>population</orgName> is sunk into the very lowest state of both mental and <!-- "into" seems to have been replaced with "in" at a later date HB 5-1-13 -->

<lb/>it as often furnished me with a text from which to tell

<lb/>sent; yet it deeply pained me, and I never felt so fully
<lb/>convinced of the lamentable deterioration of my <orgName>species</orgName> before
<lb/>It is indeed a mournful truth that "man has become like
<lb/>the beasts that perish" ᅳ<space dim="horizontal" extent="7" unit="chars"/>The country abounds with

<lb/>was actually devoured in her garden during my visit
<lb/>and that so near the town, I had frequently walked
<lb/>far past it, fully convinced me that there are good

<lb/>our churches could have heard their sad wailings, it would have
<lb/>awakened the firm resolution to do more for the <orgName>heathen</orgName> than they
<lb/>have done. <space dim="horizontal" extent="6" unit="chars"/>In some countries the light which the <bibl>gospel</bibl> once

<lb/>hope is springing up among the <orgName>converts</orgName> of <orgName>the two <!-- "hope is" seems to have been deleted at a later date HB 5-1-13 -->
<lb/>missions</orgName> is to find an outlet. I conceive that
<lb/>even now <orgName>the two missions</orgName> by cordial cooperation
<lb/>might at once supply with <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term> all the
<lb/>tribes within the range of our knowledge who are
<lb/>not inimical to claims of the <bibl>gospel</bibl>. It would
<lb/>not require more than six from each <orgName>mission</orgName> to
<lb/>give two to each friendly tribe. And that this measure
<lb/>or an attempt at it would be advantageous to both
<lb/>churches I need not refer <gap agent="deletion" extent="3" unit="chars"/> you to the effects which

                

	<pb n="0007" facs="liv_000511_0007"><!--pb/@n='7'--></pb>
<lb/>increased benevolent exertions have on <orgName>churches</orgName> at home, and
<lb/>how often it happens that when <orgName>churches</orgName> have <unclear cert="high">not</unclear> work set 
<lb/>before them in the cause of <persName>Christ</persName> even more than they can
<lb/>actually perform, their benevolence degenerates into selfish <choice><sic>quarreling</sic><corr>quarrelling</corr></choice>
<lb/>You will please to observe that I do not advance this proposition
<lb/>without diffidence, for I am sensible my sentiments on account of
<lb/>want of experience are entitled to much less deference than those
<lb/>of others in the same field ᅳ</p>
<lb/><p>I may perhaps be permitted to relate an incident which seems
<lb/>to indicate that even the darkest minds feel the need of a something to
<lb/>speak peace to their troubled thoughts ᅳ On one occasion <persName>Sekomi</persName>
<lb/>having sat by me in the hut for some time in deep thought, at length
<lb/>addressing me by a pompous title said "I wish you would change
<lb/>my heart. Give me medicine to change it for it is proud,
<lb/>proud and angry, angry always". I lifted up the <bibl>testament</bibl> &amp;
<lb/>was about to tell him of the only way in which the heart 
<lb/>can be changed but he interrupted me by saying "Nay I
<lb/>wish to have it changed by medicine, to drink it have it
<lb/>changed at once, for it is always very proud and very 
<lb/>uneasy, and continually angry with <choice><sic>some one</sic><corr>someone</corr></choice>" He then
<lb/>rose and went away. This seemed to me the more
<lb/>remarkable as we had not then spoken to either him
<lb/>or his <orgName>people</orgName> on the necessity of a change of heart ᅳ</p>
<lb/><p>Another incident which also happened amongst the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> gave me some encouragement to hope
<lb/>that even itinerating by <orgName>native</orgName> <orgName>Christians</orgName> may by the
<lb/>Divine blessing be productive of good. Late one <w>even-
<lb break="no"/>-ing</w> as I was asleep on one side of the hut, a young
<lb/>man having a most intelligent expression of <w>count-
<lb/>-enance</w> came in with a present of food, and said,
<lb/>"I once carried the gun of <persName>Sepamore</persName> (a <orgName>member of the church</orgName>
<lb/>here) when he was in this country <term type="occupation">hunting</term> ᅳ And I asked
<lb/>him what he thought about God." (Here he gave me
<lb/>a surprisingly correct <del type="strikethrough">of</del> account of the Supreme
<lb/>Being.) "But" added he "What do you say?" Most 
<lb/>gladly I confirmed what he had heard and added a
<lb/>little more to his stock by telling him of "<persName>Jesus</persName> and 
<lb/>the Resurrection" This may have been all curiosity
<lb/>But it may please the Holy Spirit to operate by
<lb/>even these small portions of truth, and lead some 
<lb/>though unknown to us, into the regions of everlasting 
<lb/>glory. And if so our intineracies will not be in vain

      

	<pb n="0008" facs="liv_000511_0008"><!--pb/@n='8'--></pb>
<lb/>I was much gratified by the hospitality <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> by the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term> to
<lb/>myself and the two <orgName>natives</orgName> who accompanied me. We came among
<lb/>them without anything to insure us a good reception, and after
<lb/>living for a fortnight entirely on the bounty of the <term type="occupation">chief</term>, When we 
<lb/>left he sent 30 of his <orgName>people</orgName> to guard us and carry the presents he
<lb/>had given to both myself and <orgName>people</orgName>, safely to the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice>. Four
<lb/>of these he instructed to proceed with me to <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>, and bring
<lb/>him back a faithful report of all the wonderful things I had
<lb/>told him. They are, an <term type="occupation">under chief</term> of his and three <term type="occupation">servants</term>
<lb/>I wish and pray that I may be useful to them so that
<lb/>when they return they may tell not only the strange custom<add place="below">s</add>
<lb/>of the "<orgName>Makuas</orgName>" but also the "wonderful works of God."</p>
<lb/><p>I have finished what I had to say about the
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>, But my visit to them was not <w>accomp-
<lb break="no"/>-lished</w> in one space of time. I walked to the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> who
<lb/>live about 24 miles <placeName><region>East by South</region></placeName> of <persName>Sekomi</persName>. Remained
<lb/>there a few days. ᅳ proceeded to the <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term> who lie
<lb/>about 15 miles <placeName><region>North by West</region></placeName> of the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> and then
<lb/>returned to the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>. Thence after two days
<lb/>across the sands I reached the <choice><orig>waggon</orig><reg>wagon</reg></choice> in safety ᅳ</p><!-- Indecipherable later writing underneath the last few words of the text HB 5-2-13 -->
<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> live on a very high range of dark
<lb/>coloured, naked basaltic rocks. These lie close upon
<lb/>the right nearly the whole way from the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>;
<lb/>and when arrived opposite where the villages are built
<lb/>we turn suddenly round and begin to ascend by a <!-- "turn" seems to have been amended to "turned", and "begin" seems to have been amended to "began" at a later date HB 5-2-13 -->
<lb/>narrow ravine or rather cleft in the rock down
<lb/>which there rushes a mountain stream. By the 
<lb/>path we attain an elevation of three or four hundred feet
<lb/>above the valley we have left. And enter a flat area <!-- "we have left" seems to have been deleted at a later date HB 5-2-13 -->
<lb/>covered with trees. But have rocks rise up <w>perpend- <!-- "But" seems to have been deleted at a later date HB 5-2-13 --><lb break="no"/>-icularly</w> on all sides except at the narrow doorway by
<lb/>which we entered. Directly in front the rocks

<lb/>now perceive perched like <term type="animal">eagles</term> nests the little huts
<lb/>of the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term>. We began to climb up towards them
<lb/>and frequently looked up to see when a <orgName>crowd of
<lb/><orgName>natives</orgName></orgName> should collect to gaze at our arrival. But
<lb/>we were permitted to ascend in silence and when on

<lb/>the body of the rock, and thus form considerable cavities <!-- "form" seems to have been amended to "forming" at a later date HB 5-2-13 -->
<lb/>which are used by the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> as retreats in time of 
<lb/>danger from their <orgName>enemies</orgName> ᅳ The one which I entered
<lb/>held nearly all the <orgName>inhabitants</orgName> of a village and <persName>Mosilikatsi</persName>
<lb/>was completely foiled in all his attempts to destroy them.

<lb/>their attempts to suffocate them were also in vain for
<lb/>the rents are so numerous the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> breathed with

<lb/><p>The <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> have a bad name among all the other tribes <!-- "The Bakaa" seems to have been deleted at a later date HB 5-2-13 -->
<lb/>and I believe they fully deserve it<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> for a few years ago 
<lb/>they destroyed, by poisoning both water and food the <del type="strikethrough">first</del><add place="above">second</add>

<lb/>accounted for by the fact that I saw as ornaments round their

<lb/>they however during the few days of my stay with them treated

<lb/>This journey discloses to me that when I have acquired

<lb/>the Divine assistance I hope I shall be enabled to conquer.
<lb/>When I left the <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> the <term type="occupation">chief</term> sent his son with a
<lb/>number of his <orgName>people</orgName> to see me safe part of the way
<lb/>to the <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term>. I shall not however say anything
<lb/>more respecting them <choice><orig>untill</orig><reg>until</reg></choice> I get better acquainted with
<lb/>their actual condition</p>
<lb/><p>On returning to the country of <persName>Bubi</persName>, I found 16
<lb/>of the <orgName>people of <persName>Sebegwe</persName></orgName> (g sounded gutterally) waiting my
<lb/>arrival. He is <term type="occupation">chief</term> of one half of the <term type="tribe">Wanketze</term> tribe &amp;
<lb/>lives nearly ten days directly west of <persName>Bubi</persName>. He was <w>drive<supplied cert="high">n</supplied></w>
<lb/>into his present position in the sandy desert by <persName><w>Mosilikats<supplied cert="medium">i</supplied></w></persName>
<lb/>and there he had the address to cut off many detachments
<lb/>of the <orgName>forces of that marauder</orgName> while all the other tribes
<lb/>fled before them. By superior generalship he managed
<lb/>to keep possession of his <term type="animal">cattle</term>, the others having lost theirs
<lb/>are envious and having leagued together lately, purchased
<lb/>a number of <term type="animal">horses</term> &amp; guns in order to deprive <persName>Sebegwe</persName>


	<pb n="0011" facs="liv_000511_0011"><!--pb/@n='11'--></pb>
<lb/>of what he alone had courage to defend. In order that he might be a 
<lb/>more easy prey to them they have been trying for some time to induce
<lb/>him to come out of his present situation to a country near to <settlement type="town">Bulei</settlement>,
<lb/>where he can sow <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> &amp;c. <persName>Sebegwe</persName> could not trust the tribes in
<lb/>this direction for he knew that the individuals who had prepared to attack
<lb/>him belong to all the <orgName>Southern tribes</orgName>. Even his own brother <unclear cert="low"><persName>Sehutsane</persName></unclear>
<lb/><term type="occupation">chief</term> of the other half of the <unclear cert="low"><term type="tribe">Wanketsge</term></unclear> murdered the <term type="occupation">ambassadors</term> which
<lb/><persName>Sebegwe</persName> had sent to conciliate him: The plundering expedition
<lb/>was to have left this quarter during the time I was in the <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bakwani</term>
<lb/>country</region></placeName>. I therefore felt anxious to inform him of his danger,
<lb/>and thus by doing as I should have wished to be done by perhaps
<lb/>prevent much bloodshed. But I found it quite impossible to 
<lb/>proceed into the desert. The sand and want of water are almost
<lb/>insuperable obstacles to the <term type="occupation">traveller</term> in that direction. <persName>Bubi</persName>
<lb/>however unknown to me sent off a <term type="occupation">messenger</term> to <unclear cert="low"><persName>Sebegwe</persName></unclear> to
<lb/>state to him my wish to see him. The result was these <orgName>people</orgName>
<lb/>were sent to invite me to an interview in order as <persName>Sebegwe</persName> stated
<lb/>that "I might speak words of truth to him" He wishes to come o<gap agent="damage" extent="4" unit="chars"/>
<lb/>of his present uncomfortable situation in order that his <orgName>people</orgName>
<lb/>may grow <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> &amp;c. But the machinations of certain individuals
<lb/>in the tribes in this direction has hitherto prevented him. He says
<lb/>he would have come immediately to live with me at <placeName><persName>Bubi</persName>'s</placeName>
<lb/>had I intended to remain, But not knowing the intentions of
<lb/>the <orgName>Directors</orgName> with respect to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> I could not invite him
<lb/>to <unclear cert="medium">remove</unclear>. So great is the impression in favour of our
<lb/>superior power amongst all the <orgName>people</orgName> in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. Each
<lb/>tribe imagines if one <orgName>European</orgName> lived with them, they would
<lb/>be quite safe. They think those who <del type="strikethrough">I</del> conquered <unclear cert="low"><persName><w>Mosilik<gap extent="4" unit="chars" agent="hole"/></w></persName></unclear>
<lb/>are invincible, and <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> distinguish as yet the difference

<lb/>what <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> are &amp; perhaps that was the reason
<lb/>he had confidence in my veracity. He has been visited
<lb/>by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> when not so far <placeName><region>North</region></placeName> as at present.
<lb/>I am happy to be able to add that the Lord has turned the
<lb/>counsels of those who were bent upon plundering <persName>Sebegwe</persName>
<lb/>into foolishness. Many from the neighbouring tribes
<lb/>have sent for <term type="animal">horses</term> and guns as far as to <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>but all their plans have a few days ago fallen to
<lb/>the ground. It is also pleasant to add that through
<lb/>the whole although frequently enticed the <orgName>believers</orgName> to
<lb/>a man have stood true to their principles and refused
<lb/>to have <choice><sic>any thing</sic><corr>anything</corr></choice> to do with the counsels of the wicked

<lb/>With respect to the prospects for <orgName>missions</orgName> in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> I think they <del type="strikethrough">prospects</del>
<lb/>are encouraging. There is no desire to have us, but there is security for
<lb/>both life &amp; property with any of all the tribes we know, and scope for
<lb/>our labours provided we enter the field. Here on the outskirts we might
<lb/>remain without the probability of being disturbed But we should not have scope
<lb/>so wide as in thousands of villages in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. We must I conceive go
