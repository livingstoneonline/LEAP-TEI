<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>I am in very different circumstances
<lb/>now from those in which I expected to have addressed
<lb/>from our new station, the <term type="animal">lions</term> here are very
<lb/>numerous &amp; very troublesome and besides having
<lb/>attacked us here &amp; destroyed some of the <term type="animal">cattle</term> of <orgName>our
<lb/>people</orgName> one of them destroyed 9 <term type="animal">sheep</term> &amp; <term type="animal">goats</term> in
<lb/>broad day light on a little eminence opposite our
<lb/>hut last <choice><sic>wendnesday</sic><corr>wednesday</corr></choice>. The <orgName>natives</orgName> came screaming
<lb/>to us as we were engaged in the water course and
<lb/>as all operations were immediately suspended
<lb/>I very imprudently returned across the valley
<lb/>in order to encourage them to destroy him. This
<lb/>very nearly cost me my life for after he was
<lb/>wounded he rushed down bit <persName>Mabalwe</persName> badly on the 
<lb/>thigh, another <orgName>native</orgName> on the shoulder &amp; myself on
<lb/>the arm, the humerus is splintered &amp; his teeth have
<lb/>produced deep wounds which may trouble me for a
<lb/>long time. Had it been directly in the way of duty
<lb/>I should not have cared for the pains, but
<lb/>I have not that consideration to compare myself by
<lb/>it was not so contrary to my regular rules
<lb/>of acting I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what induced me to go
<lb/>however I have great cause for thankfulness

<lb/>I am sorry this event has happened
<lb/>now for it gives our friends the <persName>Edwards</persName>
<lb/>trouble which various circumstances render
<lb/>them ill able to bear - If you are writing to 
<lb/>the <orgName>Directors</orgName> Perhaps you might give them the
<lb/>substance of the above account I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know
<lb/>what they will think of me after this but it
<lb/>seems to me we ought to tell them our misfortunes
<lb/>and the causes of them too, faithfully. --</p>
<lb/><p>Before I met with this misfortune I
<lb/>thought of requesting to purchase from you
<lb/>an <unclear cert="low">adage</unclear>, large handsaw, the one I have is very
<lb/>small, a common axe or two, with any other
<lb/>tools either <term type="occupation">smithy</term> or <term type="occupation">carpenters</term> you have spare
<lb/>I think I may still request them for it is <w>fort<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>unately</w> the left arm that is injured so I shall
<lb/>be able to work with the right while that is still
<lb/>weak.</p>
<lb/><p>You know I have a brother in <placeName><country>America</country></placeName>; he
<lb/>is partly dependent on me &amp; as in the 
<lb/>transmission of small arms frequent failures
