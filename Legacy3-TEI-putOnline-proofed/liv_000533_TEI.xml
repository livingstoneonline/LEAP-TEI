<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My Dear Sir</p> <!-- Adrian, I seem to be missing some images from this letter (didn't see in Agnes) so I cannot 100% attest to spacing -  this letter should be reviewed. HB --><!-- OK. AW -->
<lb/><p><space extent="2" unit="words"/>Your most welcome letter I found a few days ago on
<lb/>returning from a tour in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>, and I assure you the perusal
<lb/>of it afforded me a great amount of enjoyment. Every topic
<lb/>to which you advert is interesting, indeed everything from home
<lb/>is peculiarly so. Just like cold water to a thirsty soul, so you
<lb/>must not imagine it was unworthy "a passage <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice> the <placeName><geogName type="ocean">Atlantic</geogName></placeName>"
<lb/>I thank you heartily for it and earnestly hope you may find
<lb/>it convenient soon to give me just such another</p>
<lb/><p>I am not surprised you have not seen any account of my
<lb/>labours in <bibl>the magazine</bibl>, the reasons are, I am not yet settled, the
<lb/><orgName>Directors</orgName> expecting their <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> would soon follow instructed
<lb/>me to remain at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> till his arrival, and this in <choice><sic>oder</sic><corr>order</corr></choice> to
<lb/>obtain the benefit of his local knowledge of the country in the choice <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>of a suitable location for a new mission. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <choice><abbr>M</abbr><expan>Moffat</expan></choice></persName>'s departure
<lb/>having been delayed my labours have been mixed with those of
<lb/>the elder <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>. Good has been done but as I believe
<lb/>it has been effected chiefly through the instrumentality of my
<lb/>predecessors I have not felt at liberty to advert to it in <bibl>my letters</bibl>
<lb/>to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> except in a vague &amp; general manner; I have
<lb/>also examined the country for myself &amp; been much farther <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> than any other <orgName>European</orgName> &amp; preached the glad
<lb/>tidings of mercy beyond every other man's line of things But
<lb/>these labours have <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">been</add> all of a preparatory nature. Nothing permanent
<lb/>has been effected. But now in company of <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edwards</persName> of
<lb/>this mission I expect very soon to commence a station
<lb/>among the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>, they are situated very near the spot
<lb/>where <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName> faced about to go home and, the iron
<lb/><choice><orig>founderies</orig><reg>foundries</reg></choice> which he heard of but was not permitted to see
<lb/>belong to them. The reason he was forbidden the sight of them
<lb/>was a foolish idea that his presence would bewitch
<lb/>the iron. No one dare approach them who has had intercourse
<lb/>with the other sex since the commencement of the season in
<lb/>which they work it. He would certainly bewitch it, I who
<lb/>am yet in a state of single blessedness can examine them as
<lb/>I like, and I assure you it is difficult to maintain my
<lb/>gravity when I see iron bewitched. If they use their bellows
<lb/>too briskly having no lime in their furnaces, the iron becomes
<lb/>burned to a cinder. They take out that &amp; looking upon it in
<lb/>consternation exclaim behold the effects of witchcraft. The evidence
<lb/>is so clear no one doubts it. They then apply a double portion
<lb/>of their prophylactic against witchcraft &amp; begin the process again</p>
<lb/><cb/>
<lb/><ab>This is a <bibl><foreign xml:lang="la">parvum in multo</foreign> letter</bibl> but you must its many blunders, my sentences sometimes come tailforwards as in
<lb/><term type="tribe">Sichuana</term> &amp; require many corrections Will you be so kind as <supplied cert="high">to</supplied> present my <term type="faith">Christian</term> regards to your much respected father &amp; mother &amp; to your partner

<lb/><p resp="no-indent">Our station will be about a day beyond the spot where <persName>Mosilikatze</persName>
<lb/>was seen by <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName>. I lately walked over the site of his town &amp; <!-- geog: Mosilikatze's town -->
<lb/>the field where he suffered such a dreadful defeat by a handful
<lb/>of <term type="nationality">Dutch</term> <orgName><choice><sic><app><rdg>boors</rdg><rdg>boers</rdg></app></sic><corr>Boers</corr></choice></orgName>, the grass had recently been burned off the country <!-- Well coded, Anne! HB -->
<lb/>so I could obtain a good view of the whole and a very few human
<lb/>bones were all I could discover of what belonged to the tyrant. He is
<lb/>still alive &amp; continues his career of blood. He lives at a distance
<lb/>at least <measure>300 miles</measure> north east of that now. But last year
<lb/>he sent out a marauding party to the <term type="tribe">Bakwain</term>, <term type="tribe">Wanketze</term>
<lb/>&amp; other tribes and there committed great excesses upon them
<lb/>Besides great slaughter of the males they plundered these tribes
<lb/>of all their <term type="animal">cattle</term> &amp; took many of the women &amp; children captive
<lb/><persName>Makabba</persName> who was the terror of the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> in <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName>'s time
<lb/>has been succeeded by a son called <persName>Sebegwe</persName>, who is the bravest
<lb/>of all the <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term>. <persName>Mosilikatze</persName> could never overcome him
<lb/>for he retired into the great <placeName><geogName type="desert">Bakalihari desert</geogName></placeName> &amp; there by his
<lb/>tactics cut off detachment after detachment of <orgName><persName>Mosilikatze</persName>'s
<lb/>people</orgName>, sometimes he finished them so completely not one
<lb/>returned to tell the tale. Last year when I was in the <placeName><region><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term>
<lb/>country</region></placeName> <persName>Sebegwe</persName> sent messengers to me to say that he was
<lb/>now anxious to leave the desert &amp; return to his own country <!-- geog: Bakalihari -->
<lb/>&amp; requested me to tell him if it might be a safe movement. I
<lb/>told him although the <orgName>people of <persName>Mosilikatze</persName></orgName> had been driven away
<lb/>many of the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> (people of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>) refused the gospel
<lb/>&amp; having now got guns would certainly attack him for the
<lb/>sake of his <term type="animal">cattle</term>. Several of the <orgName>believers of <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName></orgName>
<lb/>happened to be in that country at the time when <choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>Sebegwe</expan></choice> contrary to <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>my advice did leave the desert, they visited him &amp; were <!-- geog: Bakalihari -->
<lb/>most kindly <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice> but unfortunately during the very time
<lb/>of their visit <persName>Mahura</persName> with his <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> pounced upon them
<lb/>The <orgName>people of <persName>Sebegwe</persName></orgName> being quite unused to guns fled in dismay
<lb/>&amp; the <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> murdered as they chose The <orgName>believers</orgName> although
<lb/>commanded by <persName>Mahura</persName> to fire refused obedience to their <term type="occupation">chief</term>
<lb/>on the ground that they served a higher <term type="occupation">master</term> than he. But as
<lb/>they are <term type="tribe">Batlapi</term> a most injurious prejudice was excited
<lb/>in the minds of all the <orgName>natives</orgName> in the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> against the
<lb/><bibl>gospel</bibl> by the circumstances in which they were placed at the
<lb/>time. A gun had been fired the night previous to the attack
<lb/>This <persName>Sebegwe</persName> thought must have been the signal by which
<lb/>these <orgName>believers</orgName> apprised <persName>Mahura</persName> of his situation. The singing
<lb/>at family worship their incantations for success, and
<lb/>the fact that one of the party a <term type="occupation">deacon</term> in the church here
<lb/>was in the act of collecting the people for <del><gap extent="1" unit="words" agent="overwriting"/></del> worship <!-- Adrian, I don't seem to have this page so cannot speak to what agent is for gap and if merits the del tag as well - can you pls check? HB --><!-- Done. AW -->
<lb/>(it being Sabbath morning when the attack was made) when the

       <pb facs="liv_000533_0003" n="0003"/>
<lb/>shout of war was heard was considered by all the <orgName>heathen</orgName> as only a <add place="marginright" hand="#U">17</add>
<lb/>pretext by which to aid the work of slaughter. The <orgName>believers</orgName> it was
<lb/>universally believed had been the betrayers of the brave <persName>Sebegwe</persName>. The
<lb/>object of my last tour which commenced on the <date when="1843-02-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> <choice><abbr>Feb'y</abbr><expan>February</expan></choice> last</date> <!-- Adrian, is this the most recently passed Feb 43, or the previous of 42? HB --><!-- I think 1843 is right. AW -->
<lb/>was by my presence &amp; explanations to disabuse the minds of
<lb/>the <orgName>heathen</orgName> &amp; particularly that of <persName>Sebegwe</persName> of the unfavourable
<lb/>impression <choice><sic>recieved</sic><corr>received</corr></choice>. He with the remains of his tribe live at
<lb/>a village <measure>10 days <unclear><choice><abbr>N E</abbr><expan>North East</expan></choice></unclear> of this</measure> &amp; near to the towns of the <term type="tribe">Bakhatla</term>
<lb/>The <term type="occupation">driver</term> of my waggon was one of the <orgName>party of believers</orgName> above
<lb/>referred to. When I entered the village <persName>Sebegwe</persName> with his remaining
<lb/><term type="occupation">warriors</term> was seated on the ground I squatted down beside him
<lb/>But neither looks nor words betokened complacency to my
<lb/><term type="occupation">driver</term> who during a most uproarious recognition looked
<lb/>anything but comfortable. <persName>Sebegwe</persName> demanded of me why I
<lb/>had destroyed all <orgName>his people</orgName> &amp; stolen all his <term type="animal">cattle</term>. I being a
<lb/><term type="person">Scotchman</term> returned for answer Why did you refuse to
<lb/>listen to my advice &amp; then destroy yourself. His <term type="occupation">messenger</term>
<lb/>of <date when="1842">last year</date> then recognized <del type="strikethrough">him</del> me &amp; we were soon good
<lb/>friends He said he had lost so many of his people by
<lb/><term type="ailment">fever</term>, while <add place="above">in</add> the neighbourhood of the <unclear cert="low"><placeName><geogName type="lake">Lake Mokhoro</geogName></placeName></unclear> He
<lb/>had not a sufficiency to attend to his vast herds of <term type="animal">cattle</term>
<lb/>and his desire to sow <term type="plant_foodstuff">corn</term> again with his ignorance of
<lb/>the power of guns <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">had</add> induced him to leave the desert <!-- geog: Bakalihari -->
<lb/>contrary to my advice. During the whole of my visit he
<lb/>behaved in a most friendly manner, one instance I may
<lb/>relate Having arrived on a Saturday I explained the nature of
<lb/>the following day &amp; desired to have an opportunity to address
<lb/>his people, next morning before daybreak I heard his
<lb/><term type="occupation">herald</term> proclaiming the <term type="occupation">chief</term>'s orders that no one
<lb/>should do anything that day but "pray to God &amp; listen to
<lb/>the words of the <orgName>foreigner</orgName>" At the different services he
<lb/>seemed much interested &amp; frequently asked sensible questions
<lb/>concerning the strange things I had brought to his ears.
<lb/>By the way I may mention here that <term type="ailment">fevers</term> seem the <w>great-
<lb break="no"/>-est</w> barrier to the evangelization of <placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> we have. A
<lb/>short distance beyond my farthest point north there is a fresh
<lb/>water lake <w>call<supplied cert="high">ed</supplied></w> <placeName><geogName type="lake">Mokhoro</geogName></placeName> or the <placeName><geogName type="lake">lake of the boat</geogName></placeName> on account
<lb/>of the canoes which are found upon it. The banks are level
<lb/>with the water &amp; the surrounding country flat, <term type="animal">Hippopotami</term>
<lb/><term type="animal">alligators</term>, <term type="animal">fish</term> &amp;c abound in it. <term type="plant">Bamboo</term> &amp; other reeds <subst><del><unclear cert="low">abound</unclear></del> <add place="above">grow</add></subst> <!-- Same gap/del note here. HB -->
<lb/>on its banks. There <term type="ailment">fevers</term> abound, and this lake stretches <!-- geog: Mokhoro -->
<lb/>away an immense distance to the North East &amp; south west
<lb/>A small boat carried to it would be an excellent mode of
<lb/>exploring a large portion of the <placeName><region>interior</region></placeName>. Many nations

        <pb facs="liv_000533_0004" n="0004"/>
<lb/>live upon its banks &amp; trade upon its waters. They are armed
<lb/>with guns which they procure from <term type="people">Portuguese</term> on the <placeName><region>East
<lb/>coast</region></placeName>. I hear <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> intends visiting this lake I hope he <!-- geog: Mokhoro -->

<lb/><p>After parting with <persName>Sebegwe</persName> I went northwards to the <placeName><region><term type="tribe"><w>Bakw<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-ain</w></term> country</region></placeName> which is situated on the tropic &amp; meeting some of
<lb/>the <orgName>escaped captives</orgName> there my people would go no farther. The

<lb/>Their hearts were ready to die within them so I left them
<lb/>in charge of the waggon &amp; proceeded on <term type="animal">ox</term>back. I think I

<lb/><term type="tribe">Makalaka</term> and many villages of the poor <orgName>enslaved <term type="tribe">Bakalihari</term></orgName>
<lb/>which but for this mode of travelling I should never have

<lb/>interested in them. The other tribes mentioned above live on the summits of
<lb/>a range of lofty bleak basaltic rocks, once the scene of active volcanic

<lb/><measure>300 feet deep</measure>, their flat bottoms are covered with <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetation</term> but
<lb/>their almost perpendicular sides have not yet formed a <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetable</term> mantle
<lb/>While on the outside patches of the same colour &amp; destitute of <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetation</term>
<lb/>take the form of streams running down to the plains below, some
<lb/>end in a point half way down the hill, others gain the bottom &amp; then
<lb/>spread out just as we may suppose streams of lava would do
<lb/>These rocks are rent &amp; rivening in every direction. The huge angular
<lb/>fragments which have slipped down have by impinging on each
<lb/>other &amp; the rocks below formed innumerable cavities and into these
<lb/>the <term type="tribe">Bamangwato</term>, <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> &amp; <term type="tribe">Makalaka</term> fly for shelter from their
<lb/>fierce enemies the <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> of <persName>Mosilikatsze</persName>. One which I entered
<lb/>could hold a hundred individuals, &amp; the entrance was so small &amp;
<lb/>crooked a dozen men within could stand &amp; defend it against the
<lb/>ingress of a single individual, crawling in on all fours. Into another
<lb/>a whole village entered, &amp; when the <term type="tribe">Matibele</term> besieged one entrance
<lb/>the people had another by which at night they went to draw
<lb/>water &amp; bring wood for cooking. The <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> have a bad name
<lb/>among all the other tribes because a few years ago they killed
<lb/>a <term type="occupation">trader</term> &amp; all his people by poison. When I visited them <date when="1842">last year</date>
<lb/>I saw pieces of his gun locks, tin jugs &amp; sailcloth of his waggon
<lb/>worn as ornaments by them. <date when="1842">Last year</date> a <orgName>native</orgName> who was
<lb/>with me became ill during our visit to them, the man himself &amp;
<lb/>all the other tribes believe he was <term type="ailment">poisoned</term>. I however do not believe
<lb/>it for I saw symptoms of indisposition before we arrived there
<lb/>The <term type="tribe">Bakaa</term> determined <date when="1843">this year</date> to give us nothing at all &amp; thus
<lb/>avoid a similar imputation. There was no game near so we
<lb/>had to feast for two days on the delectable things we saw
<lb/>in our dreams. This low diet had a good effect on me for
<lb/>when descending their lofty rocks after having addressed them
<lb/>I felt so much interested in the questions they were putting
<lb/>concerning what they had heard I forgot for a moment
<lb/>where I was going and then feeling as if about to fall
<lb/>made a violent effort to save myself. But though I succeeded
<lb/>I struck my hand with so much violence on a sharp angle
<lb/>as produced a <term type="ailment">compound fracture of the finger bone</term>. The <w>testam<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>ment</w> served as a rest between which &amp; <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">the rock</add> my finger was
<lb/>injured, &amp; a very good splint was made of a piece of reed. The
<lb/>fasting I suppose prevented <term type="ailment">irritative fever</term> and although I did
<lb/>not rest a day on account of it, it was about to heal <unclear cert="medium">kindly</unclear>
<lb/>But one night a <term type="animal">lion</term> began to roar most tremendously
<lb/>&amp; very near to the bush at which we were all fast asleep. It was
<lb/>nearer than from your room in the dispensary to the open street
<lb/>My <term type="animal">ox</term> leapt in among us. My poor <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> shrieked for fear
<lb/>and I half awake &amp; stupid <choice><sic>siezed</sic><corr>seized</corr></choice> a pistol with the disabled hand fired
<lb/>at the monster but the rebound rebroke my finger. When we
<lb/>got him driven away the poor <term type="tribe">Bakwains</term> (three of that tribe
<lb/>went with me as <term type="occupation">guides</term> my own people being all with the waggon) seeing the

<lb/>blood running, said, "You have hurt yourself but you have redeemed us
<lb/>Henceforth we shall swear by you" O that they knew the value of
<lb/>the blood which was shed for the redemption of their souls. The
<lb/>second <term type="ailment">fracture</term> was worse than the first but as I can bear a little
<lb/>pain pretty well it did not hinder me so much as I expected it should
<lb/>It prevented my obtaining provisions by my gun, and the whole party
<lb/>being entirely <choice><sic>dependant</sic><corr>dependent</corr></choice> on it we should have been put to <unclear cert="medium">shifts</unclear> had
<lb/>it not been for the kindness of the <term type="tribe">Bakalihari</term>. They generously
<lb/>gave what food they had, and although some of it is absolutely
<lb/>indigestible &amp; undergoes no alteration by being subjected to the
<lb/>actions of the stomach, I never enjoyed better health. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice>
<lb/>remember ever to have seen the physiological effects of the
<lb/>food of <persName>John the Baptist</persName> X noticed by <choice><sic>comentators</sic><corr>commentators</corr></choice>. The <term type="insect">locusts</term>
<lb/>are the most constipating food I ever ate. They taste just like
<lb/>the <term type="plant_foodstuff">vegetables</term> on which they subsist, generally more like the soft
<lb/>juicy part of a stalk of <term type="plant_foodstuff">wheat</term> which perhaps you may have
<lb/>tasted &amp; far better than <term type="animal">shrimps</term> at home. The <term type="foodstuff">wild honey</term>
<lb/>has the very opposite tendency, the two combined form one

<lb/>soon as a conveyance can be got down to the <placeName><settlement type="town">Bay (Algoa)</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>I shall dispatch them for you. I send in the course of a

<lb/>women</orgName> carry their children <choice><abbr>viz.</abbr><expan>videlicet</expan></choice> slung on the back with the head exposed
<lb/><supplied>to</supplied> the piercing rays of the sun I felt certain that affections of the head
<lb/>should be of frequent occurrence. I have however never
<lb/>met with a single case of either <term type="ailment">congestive or inflammatory
<lb/>affections of the brain</term>; the above custom put me on the
<lb/>"look out" for <foreign xml:lang="la"><term type="ailment">Hydrocephalus</term></foreign> but have not as yet observed
<lb/>one case in the least degree resembling that disease. On enquiring
<lb/>amongst the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> who have paid most attention to disease
<lb/>I find it is exceedingly rare among the <orgName><w>native<del type="strikethrough">s</del></w> children</orgName> while among
<lb/>the children of <orgName>Europeans</orgName> it is as common as <unclear cert="low"><term type="ailment">meningitis</term></unclear>
<lb/>During a period of twelve years <persName>Mrs Edwards</persName> a very accurate observer

<lb/>not amounting to 40 individuals in all I am informed no fewer

<lb/>most anxious to know what they are &amp; next time I <unclear cert="low">write</unclear>
<lb/>I shall remember yours for the sake of ascertaining</p>
<lb/><p>With respect to <term type="ailment">consumption</term>, I saw it prevailing very

<lb/>coast</region></placeName>. This <del type="strikethrough">region</del> <add place="above">district</add> is reputed in the <placeName><region>colony</region></placeName> as peculiarly favourable
<lb/>for the cure of that disease. I have made many enquiries
<lb/>on the subject &amp; the only reasons for the idea are the <w>follow<supplied>ing</supplied></w>
<lb/>Two individuals are reported to have been nearly in the last <!-- squiggle - may be "ing" from previous line AM -->
<lb/>stage but having removed to this part of the country now <!-- geog: -->
<lb/>lost every symptom of <term type="ailment">Phthisis</term> &amp; are now living in perfect
<lb/>health. One is a <term type="tribe">Hottentot</term> &amp; the other a <term type="tribe">Motchuana</term>, the
<lb/>former I have not seen but the latter I had <unclear cert="low">under my</unclear>
<lb/>care for <term type="ailment">enlargement of the right ovary with shooting pains
<lb/>&amp; tenderness</term> in the situation of the other. She <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">told me</add> <supplied>she</supplied> got married
<lb/>soon after her arrival here from the <placeName><region>colony</region></placeName>, became pregnant
<lb/>&amp; was delivered of a still born child before the usual period
<lb/>Soon after that event <term type="ailment">pains commenced in the right ovary</term> &amp; not long
<lb/>after that she felt the <term type="ailment">tumour</term> which was <del type="strikethrough">now</del> <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">at commencement of my <unclear cert="medium">treatment last year</unclear></add> about the size of a large
<lb/>fist, &amp; visible to the eye on looking at the abdomen, and it continued to increase
<lb/>for several years. About twelve months before I saw her the pains
<lb/>shifted from the right to the left, but, no swelling took place. I
<lb/>gave her <term type="medicament">Lugol's solution of iodine</term> internally in large doses, with
<lb/>occasionally a <term type="medicament"><choice><sic>Plummers</sic><corr>Plummer's</corr></choice> pill</term>, and applied a large mercurial
<lb/>plaster over the situation of the <term type="ailment">tumour</term> and in the space of
<lb/>three months the pains in the left &amp; swelling in the right had
<lb/>entirely disappeared. I examined the lungs frequently with the stethoscope
<lb/>but could discover nothing to indicate they had ever been the seat of
    
                 <pb facs="liv_000533_0008" n="0008"/>
<lb/><term type="ailment">tubercle</term>. I was at first disposed to think that possibly her former
<lb/><term type="occupation">medical attendant</term> had been <choice><sic>decieved</sic><corr>deceived</corr></choice> in his diagnosis &amp; that the case
<lb/>might have been one of <term type="ailment">Bronchitis</term> rather than of <term type="ailment">Phthisis</term> But I find
<lb/>she was under the care of <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chalmers</persName> of <placeName><settlement type="town">Algoa Bay</settlement></placeName>, who seems well <w>acq-
<lb break="no"/>-uainted</w> with the use of the stethoscope, one of his own lungs being completely
<lb/>condensed - the effect of <term type="ailment">pleuritis</term>, &amp; the other frequently attacked with <term type="ailment"><w>bronch<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-itis</w></term> have led him to a careful investigation of <term type="ailment">lung diseases</term>. So there
<lb/>is the less probability of a mistake having been made. I ought to have
<lb/>mentioned that <supplied>it</supplied> is now 9 or 10 years since she left the <placeName><region>colony</region></placeName> on account
<lb/>of bad health. She is now strong &amp; if I could in answer to her
<lb/>importunate begging, give her medicine to enable her to get a child she
<lb/>would be one of the happiest of women. Perhaps this case may
<lb/>
<lb/>be accounted for by the same mode of reasoning as the arrest of
<lb/>the progress of <term type="ailment">consumption</term> for a time by pregnancy. The <seg type="weather">salubrity of the
<lb/>climate</seg> helping to complete the cure. Among <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> I have only seen
<lb/>one case of <term type="ailment">consumption</term>, she lives <measure>about 50 miles</measure> from this &amp; has been
<lb/>about 2 years ill &amp; is now much spent. I regret I have not had an <w>oppor<supplied>-</supplied>
<lb break="no"/>-tunity</w> of treating her, for if any climate would assist the curative effects
<lb/>of medicines I believe this would. <seg type="weather">It is dry, not excessively hot during
<lb/>summer &amp; the winters are bracing</seg>. It differs much from that of the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>
<lb/>And a journey is almost always beneficial to <del type="strikethrough">ind</del> invalids. The <orgName><term type="people">Indian</term> officers</orgName>
<lb/>who come here are usually quite fat before they come this length, <seg type="weather">the
<lb/>chief excellence of this climate I <choice><sic>concieve</sic><corr>conceive</corr></choice> are its dryness &amp; almost entire
<lb/>absence of sudden changes of temperature. The cold weather comes on
<lb/>very gradually &amp; when it is warm during summer the nights are also
<lb/>warm &amp; except immediately after rain which however seldom falls
<lb/>we never see dew</seg>. I slept during my <term type="animal">oxback</term> journey for three weeks and
