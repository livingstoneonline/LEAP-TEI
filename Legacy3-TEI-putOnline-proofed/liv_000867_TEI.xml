<lb/><p><space extent="5" unit="words"/>We have had an unexpected
<lb/>opportunity of sending <bibl>letters</bibl> back to <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName> but
<lb/>the time afforded has been so short I have sent
<lb/>a few notes only. This will follow the <orgName>Arab</orgName>
<lb/>who left this morning and I hope will reach
<lb/>you some time or other and let you <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">know</add> I am
<lb/>not unmindful of my friends though
<lb/>separated from them by a precious big
<lb/>lump of this which the <term type="occupation">philosophers</term> call
<lb/>"our <hi rend="underline">little</hi> planet"! I have scarcely had time
<lb/>to peruse my <bibl>letters</bibl> which we found had lain
<lb/>on an island in the <placeName><geogName type="river">Leeambye</geogName></placeName>, close to <placeName><geogName type="waterfall">falls
<lb/>of Mosioatunya</geogName></placeName> a whole year. Such a rush
<lb/>of thoughts and trembling emotions when
<lb/>I opened <bibl>letters from my family</bibl> you may
<lb/>imagine if you can, taking it into consideration
<lb/>that I have been without information for
<lb/>nearly three years. Thank God I had no
<lb/>reason to sorrow. I requested my friends
<lb/>to write to <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>, but though detained
<lb/>there for many mo<add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">n</add>ths by sickness I never <!-- Adrian is this the proper way to code DL's addition in the middle of a word, or is there a better way? HB 12-5-13 -->
<lb/>got a line. And I suppose their respectful
<lb/>silence may be translated into a rebuke for
<lb/>imagining that I should ever reach that
<lb/>port. "You think more highly of yourself than
<lb/>you ought to think" Well I must try and

        

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000867_0002"><!--pb/@n='2'--></pb>
<lb/><choice><sic>and</sic><corr/></choice> be thankful even for that.</p>
<lb/><p>I commence the descent of the river for
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Quilimane</settlement></placeName> at the beginning of <date when="1855-10">October</date>. The
<lb/>path we have already opened up has many
<lb/>advantages. The <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> post comes 3
<lb/>times a month to <placeName><settlement type="village">Cassange</settlement></placeName> 300 miles
<lb/>inland and goods are considerably cheaper
<lb/>than in the <placeName><region>Cape Colony</region></placeName>. I mean, such as
<lb/><term type="occupation">misssionaries</term> require <term type="plant_foodstuff">coffee</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">tea</term>, <term type="plant_foodstuff">sugar</term>, cloths &amp;c
<lb/>Labour is extremely cheap in <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName> &amp;
<lb/>anything manufactured by the <orgName>natives</orgName> is got
<lb/>for a trifle. I bought a pair of Wellingtons
<lb/>boots at <placeName><settlement type="town">Pungo Andongo</settlement></placeName> more than
<lb/>200 miles from the sea for five shillings
<lb/>and eight pence <term type="nationality">English</term> money and
<lb/>that was exactly the price given to <orgName>natives</orgName>
<lb/>by a <orgName>merchant</orgName> of the place for <hi rend="underline">one</hi>
<lb/><hi rend="underline">pound</hi> of ivory. This is more than the
<lb/>slimmest <orgName><choice><sic>boer</sic><corr>Boer</corr></choice></orgName> would get in <placeName><settlement type="city">Cape town</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>The difference in prices was explained by
<lb/>the <term type="people">Americans</term> giving larger prices than the
<lb/><term type="people">English</term>. They have all the <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName> trade
<lb/>in their hands. The advantage to the
<lb/><orgName>natives</orgName> is, out of sight, greater than in
<lb/>the Colony Take <placeName><settlement type="village">Cassange</settlement></placeName> and any <!-- geog: Cape Colony -->
<lb/>spot 300 miles inland from the <placeName><region>Southern
<lb/>coasts of <placeName><country><choice><abbr>S.</abbr><expan>South</expan></choice> Africa</country></placeName></region></placeName> a <orgName>native</orgName> will get from
<lb/>five to seven times more in the <placeName><region>North</region></placeName>
<lb/>than in the <placeName><region>South</region></placeName> for his ivory. The

    

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000867_0003"><!--pb/@n='3'--></pb>
<lb/>trade of the <term type="people">Portuguese</term> might have been pushed
<lb/>much farther but as I saw the other day
<lb/>in a history of <placeName><country>Angola</country></placeName>. A law was made
<lb/>prohibiting <orgName>white <term type="occupation">traders</term></orgName> from going into
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> because in almost every case
<lb/>in which war was necessary to punish
<lb/>the <orgName>natives</orgName> for the murder of <orgName>white men</orgName>
<lb/>investigation <choice><orig>shewed</orig><reg>showed</reg></choice> that the <orgName>white</orgName> and
<lb/>not the <orgName>black man</orgName> was the aggressor.
<lb/><orgName>Black men</orgName> "<foreign xml:lang="und">mão calçada</foreign>" might be sent
<lb/>with goods but no <orgName>white man</orgName> go
<lb/>himself under a severe penalty. And this
<lb/>law continued in force during successive
<lb/><orgName>governments</orgName>. I think it is still in
<lb/>force for when I was coming through 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Cassange</settlement></placeName> lately the <term type="occupation">Commandant</term> sent
<lb/>an order to all the <term type="occupation">traders</term> <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">(about 40)</add> along the 
<lb/><placeName><geogName type="river">River Quango</geogName></placeName> &amp; other places in the
<lb/>vicinity to return to the village. and 
<lb/>on their refusal the matter was remitted
<lb/>to the <persName>Governor of <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName></persName>. there is no
<lb/>restriction on trade except what is implied
<lb/>in the above. It goes on briskly from
<lb/>both coasts. <orgName>Arabs</orgName> and <orgName>Portuguese</orgName> are met
<lb/>with everywhere. The latter are like our <orgName>Griquas</orgName>
<lb/>namely, half blood. and it is curious they
<lb/>have been found in the course of a few 
<lb/>generations to become black again. The
<lb/><orgName>Portuguese</orgName> marry <orgName>black women</orgName> there

    

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_000867_0004"><!--pb/@n='4'--></pb>
<lb/>being very few <orgName>white ladies</orgName> in the country.
<lb/>And unlike our immaculate <placeName><region>Transvaal</region></placeName>
<lb/>congregation never disown their children.
<lb/>I made enquiry and found one person only
<lb/>whose children might answer like "Topsy"
<lb/>"Never had any father nor nothing" Persons
<lb/>of colour of respectability sit at the tables 
<lb/>of the richest without as far as I could
<lb/>observe any distinction on account of
<lb/>race. And I met a <term type="occupation">canon</term> of the church
<lb/>who was as black as <orgName>caffre</orgName> with short
<lb/>wooly hair, thick lips &amp; he is greatly 
<lb/>repsected and the gentleman with whom
<lb/>I was living had known him as 
<lb/>having acted with uniform propriety
<lb/>in his high office for 28 years. He
<lb/>had just returned from a accompanying
<lb/>the <persName>prince of <placeName><country>Congo</country></placeName></persName> to <placeName><country>Portugal</country></placeName> and
<lb/>the King had decorated him with one
<lb/>of the orders of merit as a token of
<lb/>approbation. I found the <term type="people">Portuguese</term>
<lb/>exceedingly hospitable not to me alone
<lb/>but to all <term type="occupation">traders</term> whom we met either
<lb/>going <subst><del type="strikethrough">and</del> <add place="above">or</add></subst> returning. They are certainly

    

	<pb n="0005" facs="liv_000867_0005"><!--pb/@n='5'--></pb>
<lb/>equal in this respect to the <term type="people">Dutch</term> of
<lb/>former times and to their descendants
<lb/>of the present day as I found them in 
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Western districts</region></placeName>, not yet soured by
<lb/>the frequent visits of blackguard scoffing
<lb/><term type="people">Englishmen</term>. The <orgName>black races</orgName> in the vicintiy
<lb/>of the <term type="nationality">Portuguese</term> settlements are immeasurably
<lb/>worse than the <orgName><placeName><region>Southern</region></placeName> tribes</orgName> <subst><del type="cancelled">of</del><add place="above">among</add></subst> which I 
<lb/>have had experience. From the <placeName><geogName type="river">Casai</geogName></placeName> to
<lb/>the <placeName><geogName type="river">orange River</geogName></placeName> I should say to every <term type="occupation">traveller</term>
<lb/>or <term type="occupation">trader</term> Behave like a gentleman and
<lb/>you will be treated as such. Play the <term type="animal">monkey</term>
<lb/>be impudent and try to cheat and you
<lb/>will get "<term type="animal">monkey</term>'s allowance"- the greater
<lb/>wickedness of the <orgName>tribes <placeName><region>North of the <placeName><geogName type="river">Casai</geogName></placeName></region></placeName></orgName>
<lb/>admits of easy explanation, but you must
<lb/>be content with my assertions only, for the
<lb/>present. When I can find time I shall let
<lb/>you into it. Rest assured it has not been
<lb/>caused by the ruffian <orgName><unclear cert="low">Zendelings</unclear></orgName> of the
<lb/><orgName>independants society</orgName>. I was the first
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionary</term> they ever saw, and we were
<lb/>attacked four times by them. Plunder
<lb/>was their object, once <hi rend="underline">we beat them</hi> off
<lb/>by simply sitting and looking at them
<lb/>after telling them they must strike the first
<lb/>blow. They were well supplied with guns
<lb/>and sometimes presented them at us. Another
<lb/>tribe began by plundering the goods carried</p>

<lb/>a disjointed sentence in your note about being satisfied with our

<lb/>were considerably bothered and it apeared
<lb/>as if we must fire, but in addition to a
<lb/>strong aversion to shedding human blood
<lb/>I had the school boy feeling of "strike your

<lb/>and not these poor ignorant savages.
<lb/>At present I firmly believe that we might
<lb/>go back without a tithe of the molestation we
<lb/>experienced, and two or three harmless
<lb/>visits would render the path as safe as

<lb/>know where we shall settle except that it
<lb/>must be to the North of this. The country is
<lb/>finer there. We never carried water but
<lb/>passed two or three good streams each
<lb/>day all the way to <placeName><settlement type="city">Loanda</settlement></placeName>. The <orgName>natives</orgName>
<lb/>are all armed with guns and swords and
<lb/>they have finished the game. The only fault
<lb/>of the new path is it admits of conveyance
<lb/>by human labour alone. The forests
