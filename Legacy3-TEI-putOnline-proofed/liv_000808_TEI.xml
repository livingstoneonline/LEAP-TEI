<lb/>
<lb/><p rend="no-indent">My dear Man</p>
<lb/><p><space extent="3" unit="words"/>I sent you a few days ago <bibl>a long letter</bibl> per
<lb/>a <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Francis Thompson</persName> who came up as far as the <placeName><geogName type="river">chobe</geogName></placeName> in
<lb/>company with a <term type="occupation">trader</term> <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chapman</persName> and since I sent off the
<lb/><bibl>packet</bibl> I find I have had time to transcribe the enclosed <bibl>paper</bibl>
<lb/>which I have taken the liberty to believe you will not object
<lb/>to read. It contains the marrow of a much longer one
<lb/>carefully written for the same destination but it was penned
<lb/>on our way here and though it contains a much fuller
<lb/>view than this. Many points are now out of date and
<lb/>will be much more so before reaching <persName>Dr Vaughan</persName>
<lb/>I had given up the idea of sending it at all, till the idea of an
<lb/>abbreviation struck my mind and now I fear that the
<lb/>haste evident in its composition &amp; writing will render it
<lb/>unfit for the pages of a <bibl>Review</bibl>. However I send it and
<lb/>my object in enclosing it to you is to request you to
<lb/>note any passages you may see to be out of date by the
<lb/>time you get it and signify the same to the <persName>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi></persName>. Is this <!-- persName: Dr Vaughan -->
<lb/>too much to ask? Well, I shall not send you the next
<lb/>but will just tell you it is much better than this
<lb/>indeed if it were not my own child I would say it is a very
<lb/>good one. So good I may perhaps keep it to myself
<lb/>altogether. It is on <orgName>missions</orgName>. The privilege of being allowed
<lb/>to engage in them. Their future &amp;c &amp;c. I wrote it in the
<lb/>weary way <choice><sic>accross</sic><corr>across</corr></choice> the desert and if it never does aught
<lb/>else it has comforted my own mind.</p>
<lb/><p>The second <bibl>paper</bibl> about which I told you and which
<lb/><persName>Mr Cameron</persName> <del type="strikethrough">told you</del><add place="above">said</add> would be published will not trouble
<lb/>you. I meant it to be a continuation of the same subject
<lb/>believing the one would not be complete without the

<lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr/></choice> other. This it seems is not admissable in a <bibl>Review</bibl>.
<lb/>Much of the <bibl>article</bibl> will be otherwise employed, and as doing 
<lb/>good was my object I am quite satisfied. I think I have
<lb/>the same object in the present <bibl>article</bibl>. It is a misfortune
<lb/>to be so far from proofsheets, one could make the composition
<lb/>so much more smooth and perhaps telling. If I ever send
<lb/>that I have by me at present it will be my last.</p>

<lb/>good like a medicine. If I allowed my mind to dwell
<lb/>constantly on the miserable degradation - wickedness &amp;
<lb/>sad prospects of the <orgName>people</orgName> here I might become melancholy
<lb/>and soon die. But we have a fair world and all the
<lb/>wonderful works of our father in it and I believe we
<lb/>ought to allow our minds to dwell on the beautiful more
<lb/>than on the evil. I am never low spirited. It might be
<lb/>different if I had a crusty companion. I have experience
<lb/>in the matter. And my thoughts never <unclear cert="low">torn</unclear> with any
