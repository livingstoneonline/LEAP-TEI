<lb/><p rend="right"><placeName><region>Bakwain Country</region></placeName> <date when="1842-04-08">8<hi rend="sup underline">th</hi> April 1842</date></p>
<lb/><p rend="left">Dear Sir</p>
<lb/><p>Before <bibl>this letter</bibl> can reach you, you may have concluded that I have 
<lb/>fogotten my promise to write you concerning your son <persName>Manning</persName>. But many 
<lb/>reasons have induced me to delay and when I reflect on the different feelings 
<lb/>which agitated my mind as circumstances connected with <orgName>missions</orgName> in the country 
<lb/>were made known to me. I am glad I have been prevented from writing you 
<lb/>sooner. Had I written you before this very probably the <bibl>communications</bibl> 
<lb/>would have had a tinge of what was at the time causing me either joy or 
<lb/>grief. for I daresay you know that though in the <term type="occupation">Mission field</term> there are 
<lb/>many things which it would be well for the people in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> to know, there 
<lb/>are others which it is well they <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know. Here I am quite <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">as much</add> separated from 
<lb/>both the failings &amp; excellences of the <orgName><term type="occupation">missionary</term> community</orgName> as you are, and have 
<lb/>been so for some months. I think I shall on that account be able to give 
<lb/>a calmer view of the state of matters so that you may form a correct 
<lb/>judgement of how you ought to act with respect to <persName>Manning</persName>. I have 
<lb/>written several times to <persName>Thomas</persName> &amp; have mentioned to him some of the things 
<lb/>which form the dark side of the picture. I feel very anxious on his account 
<lb/>for I fear that after all I can say that when he comes &amp; looks in matters 
<lb/>with different eyes <del type="cancelled">to</del> than mine he may feel disappointed. I fear he will 
<lb/>take a more pervasive view than I do, for you will <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">have</add> seen if you have 
<lb/>looked into <bibl>my letters</bibl> that I have far too much levity in my composition 
<lb/>This is not as it ought to be but I always felt, when writing, not in 
<lb/><placeName><bloc>Africa</bloc></placeName> but in <placeName><settlement type="town">Gower <choice><abbr>Ct.</abbr><expan cert="high">Court</expan></choice></settlement></placeName>. You must therefore make allowances for this 
<lb/>failing of mine. Adding to the difficulties your sons will encounter the <w>sad- 
<lb break="no"/>ness</w> which arises from being <del type="cancelled">a</del> strangers in a strange land. I fear for them 
<lb/>on this account. <hi rend="underline">It will be</hi> a sacrifice for them to make. I believe it is to 
<lb/>most. And I almost wish it were to me to sober me down a little</p>
<lb/><p>Neither <persName>Thomas</persName> nor <persName>Manning</persName> must for a moment think of settling in 
<lb/>the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> or even in <placeName><region>Caffreland</region></placeName>. If they come at all it must be to the 
<lb/><placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName>. If they halt before they reach the <placeName><region>Tropic</region></placeName> the spot where I now write 
<lb/>they had much better remain in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. I shall endeavour to explain 
<lb/>just what one would wish them to be But it would seems these 
<lb/>are not sufficient for the people or rather for the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> 
<lb/>You find <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> in some places better supplied with his <term type="foodstuff">bread</term> 
<lb/>of life than many of <del type="strikethrough">of</del> like size in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>. There is <placeName><settlement type="village">Algoa  
<lb/>Bay</settlement></placeName> This village is certainly not larger perhaps not so large as 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="town">Ongar</settlement></placeName> but it has a <term type="person">Roman Catholic</term>, a <term type="person">Wesleyan</term>, &amp; one of our <term type="occupation"><w>miss<supplied>-</supplied><lb break="no"/>ionaries</w></term> with one of our <term type="occupation">schoolmasters</term> who preaches to the <orgName>blacks</orgName> 
<lb/>His <term type="occupation">clergymen</term> besides but as neither he nor the <orgName><term type="faith">Roman <choice><abbr>Cath.</abbr><expan>Catholic</expan></choice></term> nuns</orgName> are 
<lb/>evangelical. I shall say three evangelical <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> to a place 
<lb/>the size of <placeName><settlement type="town">Ongar</settlement></placeName>,<space dim="horizontal" extent="4" unit="chars"/><!-- cannot make word out, AJS --> a small town you will find 
<lb/>the population in a <bibl>Gazetteer</bibl>. They are chiefly the descendants of <term type="nationality">Dutch</term>

<lb/>one of our <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> but not having seen it I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know

	<ab>
<lb/><date when="1842-04-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May</date> By a <bibl>letter to <persName>Thomas</persName> of this date</bibl> I inform him of the reasons which prevented my going westward as

<lb/><p>has a most excellent <term type="occupation">clergyman</term> &amp; our <term type="occupation">missionary</term> is his <term type="occupation">curate</term>. <placeName><settlement type="town">Colesberg</settlement></placeName>
<lb/>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> believe it has more than 500 of a population. A <term type="person">Wesleyan</term>, <!-- word unclear MS -->
<lb/>of ours &amp; a <term type="occupation">clergyman</term> all evangelical. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> say anything <del type="cancelled">more</del> of the 
<lb/>real <orgName>mission stations</orgName> such as <orgName><unclear cert="medium"><term type="animal">Monkey</term></unclear></orgName> <orgName><placeName><settlement type="town">Bethelsdorp</settlement></placeName></orgName>, <orgName><unclear cert="medium"><term type="animal">Rat</term></unclear> River</orgName> &amp;c 
<lb/>There ought to be &amp; are all supplied with <term type="occupation">missionaries</term>. But I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> help 
<lb/>thinking that the poor <orgName>Christians</orgName> in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName> are defended by the rich 
<lb/><term type="nationality">English</term> people in these towns above mentioned who detain <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> 
<lb/>amongst them. Some of them indeed such as <placeName><settlement type="town">Graham's Town</settlement></placeName> <w>rai<unclear cert="high">se</unclear></w>
<lb/>as much as pays the salary of their <term type="occupation">pastor</term>. But then the expense of 
<lb/>outfit &amp;c. and in some instances education too (<persName>Robson</persName>) stands a black 
<lb/>debt unliquidated. If <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> are detained by <term type="nationality">English</term> people I suppose 
<lb/>justice requires that they should in addition to defraying all expenses of the 
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionary</term> send another on to the destination appointed by the <orgName>Directors</orgName>
<lb/>If not they defend the real <orgName>heathen</orgName> for to them these <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> 
<lb/>were appointed. <persName>Mr Robson</persName> for instance was appointed to <placeName><settlement type="village">Lattabao</settlement></placeName>-- 
<lb/>Perhaps however it is not the fault of the <term type="nationality">English</term> population. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know 
<lb/>I will not condemn my <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> But all of them with whom I convened 
<lb/>seemed anxious to impress my mind with the idea that they had very large 
<lb/>spheres of usefulness (Perhaps they have I however could not see it in 
<lb/>the same light they did). And if they have spoken so to the <orgName>Directors</orgName> of course 
<lb/>the fault does not lie with them. It is not in the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> as it is in <placeName><country>India</country></placeName>
<lb/>A <term type="occupation">missionary</term> there can do more good by means of the liberality of the 
<lb/><term type="people">English</term> for support of schools than by attending exclusively to the <orgName>natives</orgName> 
<lb/>and the <term type="occupation">chieftains</term> there are generally <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">not</add> evangelical. But here, whoever heard 
<lb/>of the liberality of the <orgName><term type="nationality">South African</term> Colonist</orgName>? Where is there either a school 
<lb/>or anything else <choice><orig>shewn</orig><reg>shown</reg></choice> as the fruits of their liberality? The <term type="occupation">clergymen</term> of the 
<lb/><term type="nationality">Dutch</term> church which is the established form are generally evangelical too 
<lb/>It is not pleasant to write these things, but it is absolutely necessary for one  
<lb/>to know them before he can judge of the spiritual wants of the country. Please 
<lb/>us to count the number of <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> of all denominations. The <orgName>clergy</orgName> 
<lb/>&amp; compare it with the amount of <orgName>Colonial</orgName> population. And I am sure 
<lb/>you will not appoint <persName>Manning</persName> to the <del type="cancelled"><unclear cert="medium">that</unclear></del> part of the country.</p>
<lb/><p>Then as to <placeName><settlement type="town">Caffretown</settlement></placeName>. There are many <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> in it &amp; there 
<lb/>of almost every <orgName>society</orgName> in existence. The habits of the <orgName>Caffres</orgName> are unsocial 
<lb/>They do not congregate round one <term type="occupation">chief</term> like the <term type="tribe">Bechwanas</term>, but each 
<lb/>lives with his few <term type="animal">cattle</term> &amp; dependants to retire by himself. the population 
<lb/>is therefore much scattered and one of the greatest difficulties is to get 
<lb/>a few families collected &amp; afterwards to keep them together. I do not 
<lb/>however speak of them from personal knowledge but from the 
<lb/>testimony of those who have had opportunities of examining the country
<lb/>They cannot either remain near <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. While the <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> 
<lb/>in the <placeName><region>Colony</region></placeName> may be heard in the towns expatiating on their large spheres 
<lb/>of usefulness More on this side the river especially the <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> &amp; 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Griqua Town</settlement></placeName> <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> are exchanging sour looks on account 
<lb/>of what they deem encroachments on each others spheres. <placeName><settlement type="village">Griqua 
<lb/>Town</settlement></placeName> by means of <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term> is expanding delightfully. I wish 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> would do the same. I heard a brother about 2 months ago 
<lb/>tell another then on a visit to <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> from about 100 miles <placeName><region>East</region></placeName> of it. That 
<lb/><persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moffat</persName> wants bring out a reinforcement of <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> to live at 
<lb/><placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. What will they do here. O we shall itinerate occasionally to Towns! 
<lb/>and this the only <orgName>heathen</orgName> place in the neighbourhood of our visitor to which

       

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_000508_0003"><!--pb/@n='2r'--></pb>
<lb/>he can itinerate. On mentioning this to the <term type="nationality">French</term> <choice><orig>bretheren</orig><reg>brethren</reg></choice> at <placeName><settlement type="village">Motecto</settlement></placeName>. 15 miles 
<lb/><placeName><region>North East</region></placeName> of <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName> "A reinforcement to <placeName><settlement type="village"><choice><abbr>K.</abbr><expan>Kuruman</expan></choice></settlement></placeName>" said they "will put us out altogether 
<lb/>we must leave all we have done &amp; seek a new people<hi rend="underline">"</hi>-- &amp; it will be 
<lb/>so. Unless the new <term type="occupation">missionaries</term> go forward they will not have work 
<lb/>equal to what they might find in thousands of villages in <placeName><country>England</country></placeName>
<lb/>The population is by no means dense. The <term type="tribe">Bechuanas</term> consist of tribes each 
<lb/>of from 1 to 2000 in number. The <term type="tribe">Battapee</term>. The <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> Tribe is 
<lb/>however an exception, as it has from 10 to 12000, &amp; of which at least 
<lb/>are bitterly opposed to the <bibl>gospel</bibl>. You cannot have a large sphere 
<lb/>of usefulness here unless you come far into the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> &amp; then although 
<lb/>residing at one spot you must extend your energies over a large 
<lb/>space by means of <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teachers</term>. I know about a dozen of <gap agent="illegible" extent="2" unit="chars"/>
<lb/>tribes beyond this all quite ignorant. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> much <gap agent="tear" extent="2" unit="chars"/><add place="inline" cert="high">ex</add>pect to understand 
<lb/>it is like an <term type="nationality">Indian</term> population. Say each is 2000 in number &amp; you 
<lb/>can form a pretty correct idea of what you might meet after trav- 
<lb/>a degree of latitude between each. I earnestly recommend my Dear Friend 
<lb/><persName>Thomas</persName> if he is permitted in the providence of God to come here at all to determine 
<lb/>resolutely to preach the <bibl>gospel</bibl> in the regions beyond. <choice><sic>Dont</sic><corr>Don't</corr></choice> let him enter on another <!-- Word unclear MS -->
<lb/>line of things By bold determination I see nothing to hinder him along with <persName>Manning</persName>
<lb/>from <unclear cert="medium">earning</unclear> an interest which may <add place="below">^</add> <add place="above">be</add> more useful to the <placeName><region>Interior</region></placeName> than any mission 
<lb/><placeName><region>Southward</region></placeName>. I shall write <persName>Manning</persName> along with this explaining in what manner 
<lb/>he could be by the blessing of God as useful as any of us. It would also be better 
<lb/>for <persName>Miss R.</persName> than any where near <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>, for I think from her appearance 
<lb/>the bleak sterile prospects which that country affords would have a depressing 
<lb/>influence on her spirits &amp; ultimately induce <term type="ailment">disease</term>. The country gener<gap agent="waxseal" extent="4" unit="chars"/><!-- not sure about this MS -->
<lb/>around <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> for a great portion of the year a wretched wi<gap agent="waxseal" extent="6" unit="chars"/>
<lb/>appearance. The fields have a great profusion of low soggy <term type="plant">bushes</term> 
<lb/>(scarcely any trees) most of them arrived with thorns which <gap agent="hole" extent="1" unit="chars"/><supplied cert="high">a</supplied>re either bent 
<lb/>back like fish hooks or forwards in every direction but all villainously 
<lb/>sharp &amp; strong. The grass grows in little round clumps and there is more 
<lb/>stones &amp; sand between than <term type="plant">bushes</term> <del type="cancelled"><term type="plant">shrubs</term></del> plants &amp; grass together.
<lb/>During one portion of the year at a distance it looks beautifully green
<lb/>But even then one <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> walk in the fields with any pleasure and 
<lb/>this is an exercise which she must take. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbell</persName> visited it 
<lb/>during the favourable season &amp; he speaks of some parts as equal 
<lb/>to <persName>Mahomet</persName>'s paradise. I spent a few days in that paradise at 
<lb/>a different season of the year &amp; I was most happy when I got 
<lb/>out of it. But as we approach the <placeName><region>Tropic</region></placeName> the country loses its browned 
<lb/>parched appearance. <gap extent="3" unit="chars" agent="hole"/> dwells here are covered all over with trees 
<lb/>the red sandstone rocks looking pleasantly out here &amp; there from 
<lb/>between them. But towards the <placeName><region>South</region></placeName> they are quite bare. There 
<lb/>the <term type="plant">vegetation</term> is quite tropical the <term type="plant">nettle</term> is no longer a mere plant 
<lb/>but grows up to a tree a foot or more in diameter &amp; from 20 to 
<lb/>30 in height. The wild <term type="plant">figtree</term> abounds on the mountains &amp; though it 
<lb/>yields little <term type="foodstuff">fruit</term>, its presence indicated that <term type="foodstuff">fruits</term> would thrive 
<lb/>better here than at <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName>. I think all the Tropical <term type="foodstuff">fruits</term> might 
<lb/>be reared here without much trouble.  Am immense amount of 
<lb/>manual labour has been expended on <placeName><settlement type="village">Kuruman</settlement></placeName> to make it what 
<lb/>it is. All the trees had to be planted. Here you might select 
<lb/>a dozen sprouts for building each of them superior in picturesque 
<lb/>beauty to any mission I have seen &amp; the trees ready to your hand</p>

<lb/><p>I came here for the purpose of planting a <orgName>native</orgName> <term type="occupation">teacher</term> with this portion of the 
<lb/><term type="tribe">Bakwain</term> tribe &amp; am thankful to say I have met with a reception which has 
<lb/>exceeded my expectations. It is all through the Loving kindness of our gracious 
<lb/>God. Blessed be his glorious name and may the whole earth soon see his glory 
<lb/>After three days I set off on a long journey directly West in order if possible 
<lb/>to prevent bloodshed. The whole of the <orgName>Southern tribes</orgName> having leagued together to
