There were 3 mis-matches in total - all 3 were brought to your attention at the time -

 

(1) liv_000779 - this was a case where images included 2 extra pages that weren't included in the original transcript. See corresp 20th-30th July.  I have now transcribed these 2 pages and re-numbered the other pages accordingly, but that needs checking independently - I have put in comments to that effect.

 

(2) liv_000794 - this was a case where a section included in the transcript had no corresponding images (see corresp. 14th July).  As suggested then the letter looks complete in itself without the extra pages, so I tend to think these extra pages do not belong to this letter, but they have not turned up anywhere else, so I have retained them while commenting out as instructed.

 

(3) liv_000871 - this was a case similar to (1) but has already been dealt with by you - see corresp. 7th-10th October.
